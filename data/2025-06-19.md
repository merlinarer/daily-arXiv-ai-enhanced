TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过强化学习和内部推理增强LLM的响应可信度，使用GRPO方法训练模型，显著提升了答案正确性和引用质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在生成可信和基于引用的响应时的常见问题，如遗漏答案、错误引用或拒绝回答。

Method: 采用GRPO强化学习方法，结合两阶段训练（先优化答案和引用，再优化拒绝行为），并通过GPT-4蒸馏进行指令微调。

Result: 实验表明，结合推理和GRPO的模型在多个数据集上表现优于仅指令微调的模型，尤其在处理不可回答查询和生成高质量引用方面。

Conclusion: 推理、分阶段优化和基于结果的强化学习对构建更可靠和可验证的LLM具有重要价值。

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: CrEst是一个弱监督框架，用于在LLM推理中评估上下文文档的可信度，无需人工标注，通过文档间一致性自动估计可信度，并提出了黑盒和白盒两种集成策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常忽略上下文文档的可信度差异，可能导致不可靠信息的传播。

Method: 基于文档间语义一致性自动估计可信度，提出黑盒和白盒两种集成策略。

Result: 在三种模型架构和五个数据集上，CrEst显著优于基线，准确率提升26.86%，F1分数提升3.49%。

Conclusion: CrEst在噪声条件下仍保持稳健性能，有效提升LLM推理的可信度。

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

TL;DR: MDBench是一个用于评估大型语言模型在多文档推理任务上的新数据集，通过合成生成过程高效创建，并展示了现有方法的挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多文档推理是LLM的重要能力，但缺乏相关基准，且传统标注成本高。

Method: 采用基于结构化种子知识的LLM辅助编辑技术，生成自然文本形式的文档集和QA示例。

Result: MDBench对现有LLM和提示技术均构成挑战，且生成技术便于针对性分析和快速适应新需求。

Conclusion: MDBench填补了多文档推理评估的空白，其生成方法高效且灵活。

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在生成可逆嵌入方面的能力，为记忆检索、压缩和可控文本生成提供潜在应用。

Method: 通过引入特殊记忆令牌，其嵌入在固定序列上优化训练，模型能根据该嵌入精确重建原始序列。

Result: 在英语和西班牙语数据集上验证，支持最长约240个令牌的序列，模型规模从100M到8B参数（如Llama 3.1 8B）均成功重建。

Conclusion: LLM具备生成可逆嵌入的能力，为记忆检索和可控生成等应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放式生成长文本的评估困难，现有方法常忽略关键方面（如连贯性、风格、相关性）或受预训练数据偏差影响。

Method: 提出PrefBERT，基于两个多样长文本风格和Likert评分的响应评估数据集训练，为GRPO提供语义奖励反馈。

Result: PrefBERT在多种长文本中表现可靠，与人类偏好对齐，优于传统指标。

Conclusion: PrefBERT作为奖励信号训练策略模型，生成更符合人类偏好的响应。

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在现实中的广泛应用，事后遗忘特定知识的需求日益增长，涉及隐私法规和内容更新等问题。

Method: 通过实验研究学习时知识编码对遗忘效果的影响，对比不同编码方式的效果。

Result: 发现使用转述描述学习能提升遗忘性能，但遗忘文本块中的单个知识较困难。

Conclusion: 学习时的知识编码对实现可靠的事后遗忘至关重要。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架（多响应生成和偏好选择）来显式建模开放域对话的一对多特性，通过新数据集和策略提升小模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域对话存在一对多特性，但现有LLM对话代理未显式建模，导致多样性不足。

Method: 将对话生成分解为多响应生成（MRG）和偏好选择（PS），引入o2mDial数据集，并提出新的学习策略和评估指标。

Result: 两阶段框架显著提升小模型的多样性和质量（最高提升90%），接近大模型表现。

Conclusion: 显式建模一对多特性可有效提升对话生成质量，尤其对小模型。

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

Motivation: 探索Mamba架构中信息记忆的机制，以理解模型如何处理序列输入的开头和结尾部分。

Method: 使用结构化回忆任务分析Mamba架构，识别三种记忆机制：长期记忆、短期记忆和动态记忆分配。

Result: 发现U形准确率曲线，验证了稀疏通道、delta调制递归和语义规律对记忆的影响。

Conclusion: 揭示了Mamba模型中记忆的动态机制，为状态空间模型的优化提供理论基础。

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Conclusion: 验证了推理原型是LLM泛化能力的基础，原型学习优于自然语言训练。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinosEval is a novel method for evaluating open-ended QA in LLMs, distinguishing factoid and non-factoid questions and using adaptive strategies for each, showing better alignment with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics and current LLM-based evaluation methods struggle with semantic similarity and interpretability, especially for diverse open-ended QA tasks.

Method: MinosEval classifies questions as factoid or non-factoid, applying adaptive key-point scoring for factoid questions and instance-aware listwise ranking for non-factoid ones.

Result: Experiments show MinosEval aligns better with human annotations and provides more interpretable results than existing methods.

Conclusion: MinosEval addresses limitations of current evaluation methods for open-ended QA, offering a more refined and interpretable approach.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a

a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

Result: 在文本和视觉领域均表现出更强的生成能力，减少幻觉，保持事实一致性，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: CINGS通过改变模型对上下文的依赖行为，有效提升了生成准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Method: 开发了一种梯度选择方法，从大型公开文本语料库中筛选最高匹配数据，仅基于原始和微调模型的权重。

Result: 在AG News分类任务中，性能从65%提升至80%，接近专家基准的88%；在MSMARCO文档的SFT模型中，困惑度从3.3降至2.3。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效恢复近似训练数据，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

Conclusion: 强调了提升LLMs性别包容性的重要性，为未来性别公平性研究提供了基准。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language

genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future

Conclusion: 研究为理解后悔机制提供了新工具，并揭示了信息处理的耦合与解耦模式。

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

Conclusion: LLMs在指令遵循和组合泛化方面仍需改进。

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: 队列级强化学习能有效增强LLM的推理一致性。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

TL;DR: Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) improves structured NLP tasks by combining constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases, leveraging complementary errors for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses low-quality output in constrained decoding by dynamically combining constrained and unconstrained predictions without retraining.

Method: Uses a two-phase approach: Phase 1 generates weak predictions (constrained and unconstrained), and Phase 2 combines them via a learned boosted model.

Result: BoostCD, applied to closed information extraction (BoostIE), outperforms prior methods in and out of distribution.

Conclusion: BoostCD effectively mitigates common errors in constrained decoding, enhancing structured NLP task performance.

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics

fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Conclusion: TLI是一种参数高效且有效的方法，可提升LLM在低资源语言中的词汇对齐能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

Conclusion: PredGen能有效减少LLM在实时语音应用中的延迟，提升用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily

resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of

also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

Conclusion: LLM在临床试验招募中具有前景，但需要更强大的评估基准和开放模型以推动实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在GUI代理中表现出系统性定位错误（幻觉），影响了可靠性。需要更细粒度的评估和改进方法。

Method: 1. 提出细粒度评估框架，将预测分为四类；2. 引入PSS指标量化模型不确定性；3. 提出Context-Aware Cropping技术优化输入上下文。

Result: 实验表明，该框架和方法能提供可操作的见解，提升GUI代理行为的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs在GUI代理中的可靠性和性能改进提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Conclusion: GenRecal为异构VLM蒸馏提供了一种通用解决方案，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner是一种高效且性能优越的多句场景图解析方法，适合开源使用。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

Method: 通过分析《华尔街日报》和《纽约时报》关于通胀的文章，比较GPT-4o输出与专家标注的叙事标准。

Result: GPT-4o能够提取结构化经济叙事，但在处理复杂文档和叙事时仍不及专家水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在经济研究中具有潜力，但需进一步改进以处理复杂任务。

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the

have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to

parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and

TL;DR: 论文介绍了WikiMixQA，一个用于评估跨模态推理的基准测试，包含1000个多选题，覆盖7个主题的4000个维基百科页面。测试发现，现有视觉语言模型在长上下文多模态推理中表现不佳，尤其是开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档理解（DU）面临复杂布局和多模态信息的挑战，现有视觉语言大模型（VLLMs）在长上下文处理上的有效性尚不明确。

Method: 构建WikiMixQA基准，包含1000个多选题，评估12个先进视觉语言模型在跨模态推理中的表现。

Result: 专有模型在直接上下文下准确率约70%，但在长文档检索下性能显著下降；GPT-4-o是唯一超过50%的模型，开源模型最高仅27%。

Conclusion: 长上下文多模态推理仍具挑战性，WikiMixQA为文档理解研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

Motivation: 自动化生成MCQ的需求日益增长，但现有研究多关注英语，且对生成失败案例的评估不足，尤其是在真实场景中的应用。

Method: 研究使用生成模型为葡萄牙语阅读理解生成MCQ，并通过专家评审和学生回答的心理测量学分析评估其质量。

Result: 当前模型生成的MCQ质量接近人工编写，但在语义清晰度和干扰项设计上仍有不足。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在MCQ生成中具有潜力，但需进一步优化语义和干扰项设计以提高实用性。

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

Conclusion: 当前机器翻译系统在性别中立翻译方面表现不佳，但存在改进空间。

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

Conclusion: 持久同调提供了一种无监督的方法，能够实时检测公共话语的结构性变化。

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse?
This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change
in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news
articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol
insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we
construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving
discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram
via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and
persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic
disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major
geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected
components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative
structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag
pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order
motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An
exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads
H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse
adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse
narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a
mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points
and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge
of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social
science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during
crises, protests, and information shocks.

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that

objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)

significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital

overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle

pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate

updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

TL;DR: 研究发现，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉质量与性能之间存在矛盾，某些情况下图像质量下降反而提升模型表现。作者提出了一种轻量级适配模块VQ-TTT，动态调整输入图像以优化任务性能。

Motivation: 探讨视觉输入质量对MLLMs性能的影响，揭示传统视觉质量定义与模型需求之间的差异。

Method: 通过控制图像质量退化与风格变化，分析MLLMs表现；提出VQ-TTT模块，动态调整输入图像频率内容。

Result: VQ-TTT显著提升MLLMs在多个数据集上的平均准确率，无需额外模型或数据。

Conclusion: MLLMs对视觉输入的需求与传统定义不同，需任务自适应的图像调整。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

Conclusion: RIP通过鲁棒聚合方法有效解决了LLM幻觉问题，提升了模仿学习的性能。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously
by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called
In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant
policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform
a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale
demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined
by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally
generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To
alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning
algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's
t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of
instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP
generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an
LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial
for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory
against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both
simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success
rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks. Video results

Conclusion: ChartIR通过结构化指令和迭代优化显著提升了MLLMs在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer在风格迁移领域取得了突破性进展，为多任务统一框架提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LVMs的无训练方法未能有效利用负提示，导致在低对比度医学图像上表现不佳。

Method: 设计Confidence Map Synergy Module结合DINOv2和SAM优势，选择高置信度点作为正提示，高斯分布选择负提示，独立K-means聚类后输入SAM。

Result: SynPo性能接近基于训练的最先进few-shot方法。

Conclusion: SynPo通过优化提示选择，显著提升了无训练方法在医学图像分割中的表现。

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

TL;DR: ReSeDis任务统一了图像检索与像素级定位，提出了一种新的多模态搜索系统测试平台。


<details>

Motivation: 现有技术仅解决视觉搜索中的部分问题（检索或定位），无法同时满足需求。

Result: 提出了一个零-shot基线方法，显示未来研究有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: ReSeDis为构建稳健、可扩展的多模态搜索系统提供了实用测试平台。

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at
once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a
sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within
each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual
grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption
that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false
alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at
sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at
whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce
Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies
corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form
description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in
each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation
masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every
description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse
corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific
metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.
Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen
vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis
offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of
robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of
highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models
have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research
direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring
expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast,
generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical
practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific
model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for
the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context
learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a
few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we
propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively
evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT
datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current
limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and
practical adoption, we openly release our code.

Conclusion: PSIC是一种即插即用的隐私保护方案，可集成到现有LIC模型中。

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the
decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an
Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on
the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective
optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple
downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

Conclusion: OpenPath通过高效样本选择和避免OOD数据，显著提升了病理图像分类的标注效率和模型表现。

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art open-set AL methods. The code is available at

Conclusion: DDIS通过扩散模型和优化策略，显著提升了数据无关图像合成的质量。

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA
performance in data-free applications.

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced

of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DLoRAL通过分阶段学习时间一致性和空间细节，实现了高质量的视频超分辨率恢复。

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel

Conclusion: ECAD是一种可扩展且通用的扩散模型加速方法。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available

Result: 在胸部X光数据集上测试，性能接近未加密推理，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法在医疗图像HE推理中具有实用潜力。

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong
privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server
for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by
allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the
original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive,
particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose
an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images
into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational
burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions
with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in
compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of
eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and
computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which
is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method
was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks
using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and
introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference,
our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into
sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training
with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these
large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as
data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes
scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we
propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We
optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image
pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are
used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and
evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new
benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark
consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with
different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes,
expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we
select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used
for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can
convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a
one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater
convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at:

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative
medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust
predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of
Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges,
including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical
institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose
FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn
and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates
synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all
centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to
histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the
distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic
slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted
to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined
with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI
classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that
FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI
classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a
highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central
challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a
powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent
limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these
challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally
advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.
First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular
benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components
seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant
performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes
dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and
reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our
comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably
ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN
baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of
capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work
establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for
applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using
public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep
learning research in this domain.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

Motivation: Historical map text extraction is challenging due to lack of effective methods and training data, and existing methods struggle with complex map text features.

Method: PALETTE introduces hyper-local sampling and positional embeddings for precise feature learning, and SynthMap+ generates synthetic training data.

Result: PALETTE outperforms SOTA on benchmark datasets, especially for long and angled text, and has processed 60,000+ maps with 100M+ labels.

Conclusion: PALETTE and SynthMap+ provide a robust solution for historical map text extraction, with practical deployment and open-source release.

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from
historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)
training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific
map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene
images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their
flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these
methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting
every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This
is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex
backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a
rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for
scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel
hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around
the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and
recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn
spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across
text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to
automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text
spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+
outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical
maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with
SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map
collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

Conclusion: PDSA模块有效解决了点云分析中的问题，提升了效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which
aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data.
While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative
coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap
problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works
address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit
modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct
geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and
noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point
Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the
high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,
which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes
the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,
and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor
feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance
modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the
computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and
classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of
the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with
less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results
demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method. The code and

Result: 在CAMUS和EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上表现优异，Dice分数分别达到0.962和0.939。

Conclusion: Echo-DND为超声图像分割设定了新标准，并有望推广到其他医学影像任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have
revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical
applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in
echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.
However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and
ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise
diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a
unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a
multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.
Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial
integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously
validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It
achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively.
The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram
segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in
other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across
various medical domains. Project page: https://abdur75648.github.io/Echo-DND

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RetroMem的伪装目标检测（COD）架构，通过动态整合历史知识来增强模型对伪装场景的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有COD方法缺乏历史上下文机制，限制了其在复杂伪装场景中的适应性和效果。

Method: RetroMem采用两阶段训练范式（学习阶段和回忆阶段），包括密集多尺度适配器（DMA）和动态记忆机制（DMM）与推理模式重建（IPR）。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，RetroMem显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RetroMem通过动态记忆和历史知识整合，提升了COD任务的性能。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world
Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised
settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for
the semiconductor field.

Method: 提出多尺度特征融合框架MSNeRV，包括时间窗口增强时序一致性、GoP级网格背景表示、多尺度空间解码器和尺度自适应损失函数。

Result: 在HEVC ClassB和UVG数据集上，MSNeRV在INR方法中表现出色，压缩效率优于VTM-23.7。

Conclusion: MSNeRV通过多尺度特征融合和视频特定设计，显著提升了神经视频表示和压缩性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the
deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric
distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose
a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the
unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,
enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal
estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric
consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two
challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards
(Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur
patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing
re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse
poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV
annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal
and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely

limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar

\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically

(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces

Conclusion: RaCalNet在稀疏监督下优于密集监督方法，实现了高效且精确的深度估计。

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires
dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and
interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar
measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and
data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that
eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise
the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density
of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous
approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely
heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar
points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable
anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation
without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural
consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse
supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods,
producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.
Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment
scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%,

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for

practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under

which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific
FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a
lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively
leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the
proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural
consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient
tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution

Conclusion: M2M-Reg有效解决了高度异质多模态配准问题，且易于集成到现有模型中。

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by

synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic
segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study
investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such
heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate
gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI
(T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training
strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed
cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The
test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation
endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2,
while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared
to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR
had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in
cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for
Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53;
Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed
poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention
effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in
improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining
computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR
for clinical deployment.

including agriculture, logistics, and disaster management. In this paper, we
examine the use of drones for assisting visually impaired people (VIPs) in
navigating through outdoor urban environments. Specifically, we present a

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment
planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant
challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most
existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite
providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they
fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We
developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the
hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold
encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target
surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new
vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we
generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which
is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many
other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high
similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets,
including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical
data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders
(NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged
as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid
in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage
multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal
clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a
novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND
classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our
framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within
volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted
feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically
integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance.
Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate
that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy,
particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework
achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by
over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying
multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize
to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding
normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent
AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets,
which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies
advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is
necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into
hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and
execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally
efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We
developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and
preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model
generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset
of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based
convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary
attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)
blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To
accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum
batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights,
training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome
Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset
yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union
(IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and
underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical
deployment.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their
diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from
limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics
framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid
representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion
information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of
objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,
while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity
and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual
rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of
deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse
objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from
sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also
generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,
particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase
the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling
goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks. The project page

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and

Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains
such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges,
including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small
offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore
ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement

Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to
enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent
local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively
integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the
AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale

proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets,
robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual
Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences.
However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for
each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual
quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video
Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a
promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the
distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals.
An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets
for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video
Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models
to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model
for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal
Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent
modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques
like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss
function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most
state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific
super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study
is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen
architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation,
data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of
their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect
visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information
conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual
bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause
obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data
graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good
understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is
essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz
libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz
libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our
study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a
detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in
DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,
which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.
Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test
oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in
designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent
advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of
applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show
that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%,
depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not
necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our
manuscript.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in
developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment.
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical
cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality.
This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on
CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset.
Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD)
filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization
(CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained
models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2,
EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results
show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image
quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The
maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision,
13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer
classification performance using CNN architectures.

Conclusion: BCRNet为腹腔镜手术中的标志检测提供了高效解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented
reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on
2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical
navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise
detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this
paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that
significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery
primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a
Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture
semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization
(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for
reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve
Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a
multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale
pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations
on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code
will be available.

Motivation: 当前定量结构模型（QSM）方法在可扩展性和实际部署中存在局限性，需要高质量点云数据和多个预处理步骤。

Method: 通过图操作（如路径和抽象）集成树分割、叶木分离和3D骨架重建。

Result: 在多种条件下（如叶覆盖和低密度数据）表现良好，相对误差约为20%-30%。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模AGB估计提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，减少了对预处理工具的依赖。

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

Conclusion: pycnet-audio为声学监测项目提供了实用的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that
leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs).
The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed
schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are
retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or
analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic
indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings,
e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species,
anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is
required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small
datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce
audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review
impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio
(Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic
data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the
U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls
(Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins
2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of
ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and
environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

Conclusion: T-PPO显著提升了LLM的训练效率，适用于长序列生成任务。

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by
generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing
these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through
trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent
on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.
In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a
novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy
update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of
low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized
long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting
periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we
propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage
estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of
policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that
allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By
selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces
redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing
convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO
on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO
improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and
outperforms its existing competitors.

Motivation: LLM在动态环境中作为决策者表现出潜力，但其无状态性需要自然语言历史表示。以往研究对游戏历史的编码方式缺乏系统性，影响了行为分析和研究可比性。

Method: 框架从三个维度（动作信息性、奖励信息性、提示风格）系统化状态表示方法，并在动态自私路由游戏中验证。

Result: 研究发现，提供总结性历史表示、遗憾信息而非原始收益、以及有限他人动作信息的表示，能更接近博弈论均衡预测。

Conclusion: 自然语言状态表示对LLM代理行为有显著影响，系统性框架有助于提升研究可比性和行为分析。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic
settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language
representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically
constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents
in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken
an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact
of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability
between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods
of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the
extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward
informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes
rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,
the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it
admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments
\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find
that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language
state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which
provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language
representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw
payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior
that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more
stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit
either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play
over time, or both.

Conclusion: 通过引导模型内在能力，可自监督提升推理效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly
enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating
human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit
overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant
content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work,
we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency,
revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning.
Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in
length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped
efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight
methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a
training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior
via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop
Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct
solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly
reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our
results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and
guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable
efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a
population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates,
drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our
method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving

only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all
baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the

Abstract: Applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) contains a series of tasks
to address real-world problems with boosted capability, which have dynamic
demand volumes on diverse backends. Existing serving systems treat the resource
demands of LLM applications as a blackbox, compromising end-to-end efficiency
due to improper queuing order and backend warm up latency. We find that the
resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate
manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which
leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting
probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to
determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application
completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends
at proper moments. Experiments with diverse LLM applications confirm that
Hermes can effectively improve the application serving efficiency, reducing the

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that
our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,
offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that
complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了RAS-Eval，一个用于评估LLM代理在动态环境中安全性的标准化基准，揭示了现有模型的显著漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM代理在关键领域的快速部署，缺乏标准化的安全性评估工具，作者旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了RAS-Eval基准，包含80个测试用例和3,802个攻击任务，覆盖11个CWE类别，支持多种工具格式（JSON、LangGraph、MCP）。评估了6种先进LLM。

Result: 攻击平均降低任务完成率36.78%，学术环境中攻击成功率达85.65%。大模型在安全性上表现优于小模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM代理在真实部署中的安全风险，为未来安全研究提供了框架。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large language model (LLM) agents in critical domains
like healthcare and finance necessitates robust security frameworks. To address
the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks for these agents in dynamic
environments, we introduce RAS-Eval, a comprehensive security benchmark
supporting both simulated and real-world tool execution. RAS-Eval comprises 80
test cases and 3,802 attack tasks mapped to 11 Common Weakness Enumeration
(CWE) categories, with tools implemented in JSON, LangGraph, and Model Context
Protocol (MCP) formats. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse
scenarios, revealing significant vulnerabilities: attacks reduced agent task
completion rates (TCR) by 36.78% on average and achieved an 85.65% success rate
in academic settings. Notably, scaling laws held for security capabilities,
with larger models outperforming smaller counterparts. Our findings expose
critical risks in real-world agent deployments and provide a foundational
framework for future security research. Code and data are available at

<details>

Motivation: 探索自注意力机制的结构特性，以提升对Transformer模型的理解，并为下游任务（如模型剪枝和架构比较）提供理论支持。

Method: 利用微分理论分析自注意力的不变性，并通过层次组织方法构建网络3-张量的分区树，结合信号处理技术进行定性和定量分析。

Result: 理论证明了自注意力对softmax的不变性，并通过视觉和语言Transformer的计算实例验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为解释性分析提供了新工具，并可用于模型剪枝和架构比较等实际应用。

Abstract: We examine the intrinsic (within the attention head) and extrinsic (amongst
the attention heads) structure of the self-attention mechanism in transformers.
Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax
activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is
supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic
organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing
methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network
structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query,
key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential
since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a
geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify
this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree
comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and
quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion
coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect
to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and
heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and
methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and
language transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a
subsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can
be exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use
the network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as
model pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture
comparison.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统二值逻辑无法捕捉人类决策的细微差别，而神经网络缺乏可解释的推理结构。CALM旨在整合两者，提升AI系统的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: CALM使用领域树表示谓词，通过神经网络迭代优化其模拟真值，并结合符号推理模块确保约束满足。

Result: 在填空物体放置任务中，CALM准确率达92.2%，优于传统逻辑（86.3%）和LLM（59.4%）。

Conclusion: CALM展示了在多模态环境中结合逻辑结构与神经网络的潜力，为下一代AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM).
CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make
context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human
decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,
which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting
rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable
structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,
creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this
integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to
generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate
to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which
iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of
its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural
networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a
symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%
accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It
also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints
and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure
while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the
foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and
interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural
networks.

Conclusion: HeurAgenix展示了LLM在组合优化中的潜力，通过自动化和动态选择提升性能。

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization
(CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and
struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce
\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among
them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an
LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and
extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically
picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's
perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a
state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference
cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity,
we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism
that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception,
enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on
canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing
LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Conclusion: MEAL为CMARL研究提供了高效工具，并揭示了关键改进方向。

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly
impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual
learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce
MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark
tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL
benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks
and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU
acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a
standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL
and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to
scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation.
Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical

In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that

enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key
techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive
direction data augmentation (CDDA). Experimental results show that our proposed
directional-SpeechLlama effectively captures the relationship between textual
cues and spatial audio, yielding strong performance in both speech recognition
and source localization tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究为物理与数字智能的结合提供了挑战和机遇。

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly

Conclusion: 研究验证了CUE模型，表明改变解释可读性影响理解，支持自适应XAI界面和用户定制化XAI。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need
for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable
AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which
critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We
propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking
explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception),
readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study
(N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we
found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually
impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes
worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results
challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for
adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering
explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a
formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated
definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence
motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.

Conclusion: 具备PSO知识和WS-PSO-CM背景的LLM代理能有效找到高性能超参数。

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of
communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for
warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM)
algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and
communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of
automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large
language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an
iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In
particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the
mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the
prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for
exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and
returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal
sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is
significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation
methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM
algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

Result: 手动分类发现55.5%的描述为示例类，Llama正确识别79.75%的示例类描述，生成描述的平均相似性得分为0.7173。

Conclusion: 代码片段的文档意图因任务而异，Llama在生成描述方面表现尚可但需改进。

Abstract: Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both
developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and
other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important
for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the
key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and
evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description
generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with
1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their
descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the
majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This
finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions
lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified
the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical
to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared
to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of
0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9
indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the
code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions
for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a
library.

Conclusion: 共创学习为人类与AI的动态协作提供了实证支持，为共生AI系统的设计开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI,
i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial
perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external
representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional
AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the
challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We
empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the
Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference
mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention
naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,
always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that
human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization
accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared
sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the
MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical
evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based
interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that
learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual
experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate
complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within
Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated
from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically
process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal
association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for
further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the
unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality,
introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional
sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware
Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance
the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and
simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to
the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both
Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process.
The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA

TL;DR: 论文探讨了将AI政策模块引入计算机科学课程的必要性，并通过实验证明其能提升学生对AI伦理和政策的关注与能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术的广泛应用，AI伦理和政策的重要性日益凸显，但现有计算机科学课程未能充分培养学生应对这些挑战的能力。

Method: 开发并测试了一个AI政策模块2.0，通过课前课后调查评估学生态度变化，并设计了一项关于AI监管的技术作业。

Result: 学生表现出对AI伦理影响的更高关注，并对参与AI政策讨论的能力更有信心。

Conclusion: AI政策模块是培养学生应对AI伦理和政策挑战的有效工具，尤其是通过技术作业的形式。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings
across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid
not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI
technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary
computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI
practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical
principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of
AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the
ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future
constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI
engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new
expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI
policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in
this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version
of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present
the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student
attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys.
Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical
impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their
abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight
the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring
the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing
ethical challenges.

Motivation: 传统CNN的对称和刚性核限制了局部特征的捕捉，而可变形核能更好地与注意力机制结合。

Method: 用可变形卷积（Deformer）替换Conformer中的深度CNN，分析其局部感受野和全局注意力图。

Result: Deformer在WSJ eval92数据集上相对WER提升了5.6%（无LM）和6.4%（有LM）。

Conclusion: 可变形卷积能更有效地捕捉局部特征，提升语音识别性能。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have improved speech recognition
performance greatly by exploiting localized time-frequency patterns. But these
patterns are assumed to appear in symmetric and rigid kernels by the
conventional CNN operation. It motivates the question: What about asymmetric
kernels? In this study, we illustrate adaptive views can discover local
features which couple better with attention than fixed views of the input. We
replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with a deformable
counterpart, dubbed this "Deformer". By analyzing our best-performing model, we
visualize both local receptive fields and global attention maps learned by the
Deformer and show increased feature associations on the utterance level. The
statistical analysis of learned kernel offsets provides an insight into the
change of information in features with the network depth. Finally, replacing
only half of the layers in the encoder, the Deformer improves +5.6% relative
WER without a LM and +6.4% relative WER with a LM over the Conformer baseline
on the WSJ eval92 set.

Conclusion: 动态ASR路径方法能更高效地发现和训练多语言模型的子网络。

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a
multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance
loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to
be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive
masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model
efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse
multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically
adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network
structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when
targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR
Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a
single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network
initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

Conclusion: MixRep是一种简单有效的低资源ASR数据增强方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we present MixRep, a simple and effective data augmentation
strategy based on mixup for low-resource ASR. MixRep interpolates the feature
dimensions of hidden representations in the neural network that can be applied
to both the acoustic feature input and the output of each layer, which
generalizes the previous MixSpeech method. Further, we propose to combine the
mixup with a regularization along the time axis of the input, which is shown as
complementary. We apply MixRep to a Conformer encoder of an E2E LAS
architecture trained with a joint CTC loss. We experiment on the WSJ dataset
and subsets of the SWB dataset, covering reading and telephony conversational
speech. Experimental results show that MixRep consistently outperforms other
regularization methods for low-resource ASR. Compared to a strong SpecAugment
baseline, MixRep achieves a +6.5\% and a +6.7\% relative WER reduction on the
eval92 set and the Callhome part of the eval'2000 set.

Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to
facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) systems. The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by
the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in
particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study
the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc
interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not
shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and
the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement
WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols,
meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants
and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a
composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of
flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so
that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We
demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by
reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The
framework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.

Abstract: This study investigates the current landscape and future directions of
protein foundation model research. While recent advancements have transformed
protein science and engineering, the field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for
fair evaluation and in-depth understanding. Since ESM-1B, numerous protein
foundation models have emerged, each with unique datasets and methodologies.
However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models,
hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations. Specifically,
researchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how
well current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in
developing new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks
spanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has enabled automated analysis of complex media content
at scale and generate actionable insights regarding character representation
along such dimensions as gender and age. Past work focused on quantifying
representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without
having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along
demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general
public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work
addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based
character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the
Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze
visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of
age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for
presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to
seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the
AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our
visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics
from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also
indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic
categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in
AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they
were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code,

Abstract: In an attempt to tackle the UN SDGs, AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects
focus on harnessing AI to address societal issues in areas such as healthcare,
social justice, etc. Unfortunately, despite growing interest in AI4SI,
achieving tangible, on-the-ground impact remains a significant challenge. For
example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to
co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often
difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects
"fail" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to
transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique
challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within
the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily
applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized
in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse
challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that
prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground.
Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers -
complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research
- this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in
developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic
analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication,
collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While
there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies
drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space. In doing so, we
hope this paper serves as a practical reference guide for AI4SI researchers and
partner organizations seeking to engage more effectively in socially impactful
AI collaborations.

Conclusion: BMFM-RNA为系统基准测试和社区驱动的TFM训练策略探索提供了可重复的基础。

Abstract: Transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful
tools for analyzing gene expression in cells and tissues, supporting key tasks
such as cell-type annotation, batch correction, and perturbation prediction.
However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across
recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution
of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This
hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the
reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an
open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and
fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability,
we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED),
which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS
bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported
input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model
checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language
modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking
capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance
that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than
a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. BMFM-RNA, available
as part of the biomed-multi-omics project (
https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic ), offers a reproducible
foundation for systematic benchmarking and community-driven exploration of
optimal TFM training strategies, enabling the development of more effective
tools to leverage the latest advances in AI for understanding cell biology.

Abstract: The identifiability problem for interventions aims at assessing whether the

common backdoor set, and establish, for time series with and without
consistency throughout time, conditions under which such a set exists. We also
provide algorithms of limited complexity to decide whether the problem is
identifiable or not.

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

Abstract: Generative AI, specifically text-to-image models, have revolutionized
interior architectural design by enabling the rapid translation of conceptual
ideas into visual representations from simple text prompts. While generative AI
can produce visually appealing images they often lack actionable data for
designers In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates DALL-E 3
with a materials dataset to enrich AI-generated designs with sustainability
metrics and material usage insights. After the model generates an interior
design image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present
and pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general
materials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate
environmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system
through three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to
the prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated
to the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along
with quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our
qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of
sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design
decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall
satisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating
sustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring
the potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible
practices. Our findings showcase the importance of balancing design freedom
with practical constraints, offering a clear path toward holistic, data-driven
solutions in AI-assisted architectural design.

developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and
emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we
conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following
scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through
inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic
understanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes --
on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure,
crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes,
we also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and
concerns. We present a mapping of caregiver needs, AI chatbot's strengths,

insights to inform the design of proactive, trustworthy, and caregiver-centered
AI systems that better support the evolving mental health needs of AD/ADRD

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among
various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are
particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant
in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these
losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be
viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust
Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2)
Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution
distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false
negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which
generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization.
DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be
demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation
accuracy and robustness.

(RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we
investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling
single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations
using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data
storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the
complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By
leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the
training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,
including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can
effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing
non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.
The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous
satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy
learning in decentralised EO missions.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of
quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine
learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as
entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the
practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns
by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired
counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their
effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and
evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum
feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz
design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs
employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when
forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings
show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring
the potential of QML in real-world applications.

Abstract: Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains
a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents
a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of
violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational
(priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs
classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and
expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions
to quantify forecast uncertainty.
  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies
with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing
approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on
historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn
complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.
  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also
highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly
forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for
early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based
peacebuilding initiatives.

Conclusion: CI4GI有效解决了兴趣协同演化和假阴性样本问题。

Abstract: With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of users are
joining group activities on online social platforms. This elicits the
requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to
users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level
interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution
relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further
prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to
align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this
collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level
interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples
when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative
evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a
Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we
design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of
users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a
supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between
interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative
samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples
during cross-level interests alignment. The results of experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that CI4GI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in
individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients
globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045.
Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus
images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study
presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning
models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over
3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was
curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation
and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural
Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The
models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to
reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in
accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms,
including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as
inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet
achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time
performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU.
ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in
resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This
integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable,
cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate
diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral control is a powerful sampling-based approach
suitable for complex robotic tasks due to its flexibility in handling nonlinear
dynamics and non-convex costs. However, its applicability in real-time,
highfrequency robotic control scenarios is limited by computational demands.
This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI (F-MPPI), a novel framework that augments
standard MPPI by computing local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity
analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback used in gradient-based MPC. These
gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without
requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two
robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven
terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard
computation. Results illustrate that incorporating local feedback significantly
improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency
operation suitable for complex robotic systems.

Conclusion: 单一基础模型可生成低成本、可扩展的面部生物标志物，适用于生物衰老和疾病风险预测。

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We
built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and
fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)
and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on
749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of
cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)
and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were
clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival
analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic
factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error
of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining
accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge
outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.
FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the
highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest
(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the
independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,
race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary
prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct
facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved
prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable
facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related
mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using
relatively small clinical datasets.

Abstract: Physical caregiving robots hold promise for improving the quality of life of
millions worldwide who require assistance with feeding. However, in-home meal
assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g.,
eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV),
food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we
propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized
in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed
in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative
study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three
key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and
safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that
enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii)
diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and
physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences,
and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently
adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the
personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating
that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and
outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To
demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two
care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each
across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity
by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the
system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their
individual needs and preferences. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/feast

Abstract: Summary: Errors in gradient trajectories introduce significant artifacts and
distortions in magnetic resonance images, particularly in non-Cartesian imaging
sequences, where imperfect gradient waveforms can greatly reduce image quality.
Purpose: Our objective is to develop a general, nonlinear gradient system model

Methods: A set of training gradient waveforms were measured on a small animal
imaging system, and used to train a temporal convolutional network to predict
the gradient waveforms produced by the imaging system. Results: The trained
network was able to accurately predict nonlinear distortions produced by the
gradient system. Network prediction of gradient waveforms was incorporated into
the image reconstruction pipeline and provided improvements in image quality
and diffusion parameter mapping compared to both the nominal gradient waveform
and the gradient impulse response function. Conclusion: Temporal convolutional
networks can more accurately model gradient system behavior than existing
linear methods and may be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors.

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to

Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to

simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and

Conclusion: MCOO-SLAM通过多相机配置和语义增强，显著提升了复杂户外场景中的SLAM性能。

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment
representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level
robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or
monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion
sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor
environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only
partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate
object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose
MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully
leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent,
and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach
integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with
open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is
introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to
improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop
closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition
using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted
into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks.
Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves
accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved
robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase
rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels
based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements.
However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of
inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we
focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through
the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks.
Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading
and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we
formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for
the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the
unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. By
converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a
set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the
heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the
small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a
heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update
various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. Finally,
simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing
computational offloading and resource allocation.

Conclusion: MODS通过多源数据融合和条件扩散模型，显著提升了气象变量降尺度的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of high-resolution surface meteorological conditions is
critical for forecasting and simulating meteorological variables. Directly
applying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at
specific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that
deviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods
primarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites
and ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data
from geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the
changes in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation,
we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its
inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more
realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve
the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we
propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a
conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary
satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and
topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5
reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional
inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source
cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between
reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates
atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During
sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution
ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental
results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5
maps to a 6.25 km resolution.

the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model
achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the
15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty
estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate,
uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture
propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of
deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide
mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

<details>

Motivation: 解决低收入和少数族裔社区在公共交通可达性方面的不平等问题，尤其是在纽约市这样的高密度城市。

Method: TFA框架包含三个部分：基于区域表示学习的共享单车需求预测、结合预测需求的加权公共交通可达性评估（wPTAL），以及考虑公平性的新站点推荐策略。

Result: 在纽约市的案例研究中，TFA显著减少了因经济和人口因素导致的公共交通可达性差异。

Conclusion: TFA为城市规划者提供了促进公平公共交通的实用工具，提升了服务不足社区的生活质量。

Abstract: Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in
densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and
minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing
systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and
last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved
neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly
planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional
accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We
introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to
guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1)
spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using
region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2)
comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted
Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted
bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3)
strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider
potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we
identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income
and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results
show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces
disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From
our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban
planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in
underserved urban communities.

Conclusion: DenseNet-121模型在分类mpMRI序列任务中表现出色，且性能随训练数据量增加而提升。

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series
types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these
series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols
and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep
learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series
types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from
various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet,
EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and
their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is
identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different
training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the
out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using
mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and
its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121
model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the
other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than
0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose
performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the
external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced
operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while
substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently,
single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor
measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical
diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures
associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections
caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,
the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,
requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.
In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a
constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture
details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain
is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog
signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors
collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic
images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image
sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:
fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.
Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that
synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced
learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine
detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA
platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test
dataset.

Motivation: 当前RLHF方法依赖人工规则设计，AutoRule旨在自动化这一过程，减少人工干预。

Method: AutoRule分三阶段：利用推理模型解释用户偏好，从解释链中提取候选规则，合成统一规则集，并用于辅助奖励。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B上，AutoRule使AlpacaEval2.0的胜率提升28.6%，MT-Bench子集性能提升6.1%，且减少了奖励滥用。

Conclusion: AutoRule提取的规则与数据集偏好一致，并能捕捉独特价值，代码已开源。

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

Motivation: 预训练大型语言模型（LLM）的计算成本极高（10^13-10^15 FLOPs），因此需要更高效的方法利用现有预训练模型。

Method: 通过线性时间内的权重张量插值，生成混合专家模型的子模型（AoE），调整权重比例以控制特征继承。

Conclusion: AoE方法能高效生成功能强大的子模型，为模型空间探索提供了简单途径。

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes
discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the
prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting
federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by
leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on
federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost
associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted
a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated
black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to
activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne},
enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.
Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated
black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency
when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on
various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in
query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We

base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining

Conclusion: SFT-GO是一种高效且鲁棒的监督微调方法，能够显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large
language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream
tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as
a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their
relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains
critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that
treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups
tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM
using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard
cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging
token groups and guides the model to better handle different group
distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a
theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its
efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping
strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform
baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold
across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the
effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and
hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread
use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3
multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient
modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online
hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient
methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to
generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our
experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on
their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We
evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural
language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial
applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive
core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from
failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can
lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not
exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations
in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task
inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur,
what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To
achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an
existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher
than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we
find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task
inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible
tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each
scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning
strategies.

(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may
not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that
combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization
and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)
procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact
Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses
energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal
mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires
only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or
exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and
more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for
large-scale model adaptation.

Conclusion: SecFwT为隐私保护LLM微调提供了高效解决方案，推动了隐私敏感领域的LLM应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their
adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as
healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training
data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to
protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has
been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant
computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward
propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary
obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the
substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2)
the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework
designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a
forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations
and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax
attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and
computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers
substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling
scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the
environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy
optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired
objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also
fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from
both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward
models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate
policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining
the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an
overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the
source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this
understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling
techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we
conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.
Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling
the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

Conclusion: PRISM为神经网络特征描述提供了更准确和全面的解决方案，适用于多义性场景。

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

Result: LoX显著降低了攻击成功率（11%至54%），并保持模型对新任务的适应性。

Conclusion: LoX通过将参数移动到更平坦的区域，减少了对扰动的敏感性，从而提高了安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at

Result: 在Prompt-WNQA基准测试中，RePCS的ROC-AUC达到0.918，优于先前方法6.5个百分点，延迟开销低于4.7%。

Conclusion: RePCS是一种轻量级、黑盒方法，可有效验证RAG系统是否真正利用检索信息，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for
updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external
information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass
the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce
Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects
such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two
inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a
retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by
computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output
distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal
impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,
requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single
additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the
KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the
Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result
outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping
latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,
black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages
retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building
trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems
increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions
and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair
outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,
the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased
and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects
model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.
To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label
Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while
preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines
three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization
through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity
incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed
approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance
and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

Abstract: Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a
graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees.
While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely
overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential
for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap,
we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use
agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test
models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt
injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150
tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright
infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to
interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser,
etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and
safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and
0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier
models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide
insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply
with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt
injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is

Abstract: The pre-training of large language models (LLMs) relies on massive text
datasets sourced from diverse and difficult-to-curate origins. Although
membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace
data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM
providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data
poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not
only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its
use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn
arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent
from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models
pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are
sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely
high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme.
Crucially, this occurs without performance degradation (on LM benchmarks) and
despite secrets never appearing in the training set.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) introduces dual-use
capabilities that could both threaten and bolster national security and public
safety (NSPS). Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse
relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information.
However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to
potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500
expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary
questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information
only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE),
Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities,
with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a
corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation
of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between
potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low
average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score
(ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but
a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at
78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even
trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and
ORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding
of models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS at

Conclusion: CheckFree系列方法显著提升了分布式训练的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple
on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization.
The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the
operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the
model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use
checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an
additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield
significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases
and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,
CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by
a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state
of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,
because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover
failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+
with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last
stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is
mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by
simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover
the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring
stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively
evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with
varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates
(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant
computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our
proposals can be run via our code available at:
https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual
inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual
modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be
prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this
instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt
variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to
prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via
Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built
on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and
vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,
and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt
variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that
VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most
destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models,
outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2
family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to
training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results

they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this
difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which
suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due
to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We
propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling
robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our
interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established
algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong
performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of

Conclusion: 有限分辨率相似性是深度网络和大脑表示能力的基本信息约束。

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are
simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective
-- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.
For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with
finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions
that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification
$p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry.
Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs
predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a
non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end
reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and
empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for
linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits
persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network
and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that
finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational
constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an
exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how
semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and
brains alike.

Motivation: Transformer架构在时间序列预测中计算复杂度高，ss-Mamba旨在提供一种高效替代方案，同时保持性能并增强可解释性。

Method: 采用Mamba选择性状态空间模型，结合语义索引嵌入和样条KAN网络，动态捕获时间特征。

Result: 实验表明ss-Mamba在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性上优于传统Transformer模型，且计算复杂度从二次降至线性。

Conclusion: ss-Mamba是一种高效且多功能的时间序列预测模型，适合替代传统Transformer。

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series
forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based
temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building
upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba
selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves
comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity
from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from
pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen
series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex
seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful
enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile
and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based
models in time-series forecasting.

the learning process on the current task. Unlike previous growing neural
network approaches, we show that the number of parameters of the proposed

sacrifice plasticity to scale. Experiments conducted in benchmark continuous
control and visual problems reveal that the proposed approach achieves greater
knowledge transfer and performance than alternative methods.

TL;DR: FedNano is a federated learning framework for multimodal LLMs that centralizes the LLM on the server and uses lightweight client modules (NanoEdge) to reduce storage and communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in deploying MLLMs in real-world scenarios due to distributed data and privacy concerns, and limitations of existing FL methods for large-scale MLLMs.

Method: Proposes FedNano with NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client adaptation using modality-specific encoders and low-rank adapters, avoiding full LLM deployment on clients.

Result: Reduces client storage by 95% and communication overhead to 0.01% of model parameters, outperforming prior FL baselines.

Conclusion: FedNano bridges the gap between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, enabling scalable, decentralized multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal
reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in
real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy
requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling
collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL
for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational
demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and
heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of
full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their
massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we
propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server
while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific
adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and
trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the
need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and
limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By
transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous
client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments
demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap
between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized
multimodal AI systems.

Result: 实验表明，使用合成数据作为私有集能高置信度检测原始训练集，且保持低误报率。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据所有者提供了验证数据使用的可靠工具，适用于现实法律场景。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly
attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the
internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset
Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect
dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify
unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to
be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's
distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in
practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address
this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our
approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse
synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we
achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based
completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic
data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on
diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set
enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while
maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to
make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability
for real-world litigations. Our code is available at

Conclusion: VXAI框架填补了XAI评估的标准化空白，提升了XAI的可信度和实用性。

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably
Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with
millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major
challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency.
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable
explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and
trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the
growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation
protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct
a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a
unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant
publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar
metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization
scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation
quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and
structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection,
promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for
future extensions.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot
reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an
environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such
assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only
partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard
zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and
show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective
remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the
states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show
improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via:

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive
biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet
their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the
complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid
human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step,
interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike
static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing
physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative
perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the
potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source
LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will
involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in
diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized
"species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a
671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)
exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based
framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial
datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,
information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive
patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively
contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A
pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of
higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects
compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary
layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects
domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors
the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,
forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI
uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline
models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few
features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,
information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging
concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI
offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical
discovery.

Result: 实验表明，ODD方法在多个基准测试中改进了性能估计误差，同时保持有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: ODD方法优于DIS²，能更准确地预测目标性能，适用于分布偏移下的误差估计。

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test
domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses
disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under
distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the
target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this
approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target
error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement
discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and
target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement
should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to
high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).
Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,
removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to
estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We
conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method
improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and
reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in
generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling
choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules
introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph
information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and
designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying
sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address
these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing
of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we
introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate
seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different
attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and
SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off
between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard
conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC
achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results
highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that
may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and
characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which
the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two
neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight
vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At
convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit:
$a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these
channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of
critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like
SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression
settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with
finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture
of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and
functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of
the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities
of fully connected layers.

Motivation: 现有行为分割方法过于简化动物行为的生成过程，SKIL旨在通过可解释的技能集和动态混合策略更准确地反映这一过程。

Method: SKIL结合表示学习和强化学习，推断行为的基础技能（潜在基函数），并参数化策略为这些技能的动态组合。

Result: 在网格世界、迷宫和自由运动动物视频中，SKIL成功识别可重用技能组件，生成比传统离散模型更真实的轨迹。

Conclusion: SKIL通过组合表示生成行为建模，为复杂动物行为如何从基础运动原语的动态组合中产生提供了简洁的理论解释。

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet
diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify
this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative
assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce
skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a
reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable
skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging
representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes
policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a
simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely
moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns
continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic
trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By
exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our
method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors
emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such
as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs
rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the
challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for
exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We
introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over
the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion
model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density
estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome
this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental
connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and
its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror
descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a
pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal
exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent
understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on
both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating
promising results.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into
lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to
explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of
variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection
framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable,
data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via
natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships
of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data
dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not
only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive,
user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR
techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and
adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require
additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues,
such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy
optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on
a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the
potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption,
specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from
two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal
policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the
approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such
over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for
policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor
explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose
Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a
set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based
prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical
experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior
policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance
of policy optimization.

Abstract: When applicants get rejected by an algorithmic decision system, recourse
explanations provide actionable suggestions for how to change their input
features to get a positive evaluation. A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is
that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according
to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical
regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision
boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own
recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of
implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In
this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse
explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse
actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on
non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of
standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead
advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal
variables.

Conclusion: 训练稳定性对CDE在临床RL中的应用至关重要，需结合稳定性和临床相关性以提升策略性能。

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on
learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU
time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for
this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential
representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been
overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)
state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are
met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization
methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation
regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the
MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces
representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies
with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE
representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return
$\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only
separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity
score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.
These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode
irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training
stability in sequential representation learning.

traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on

open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment

Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly
improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments

forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across
benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast
delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine
high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage
and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater
storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during
retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate
this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single
lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of
multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to
address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous
item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the
objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's
topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both
item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep
warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network
architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer
model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into
embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these
embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong
generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage
systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including
comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in
optimizing retrieval tardiness.

Conclusion: CEP机制通过动态存储和更新知识，解决了重复概念漂移问题，为在线预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed
data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of
concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and
previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in
the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter
updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss
of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of
knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully
utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool
(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for
different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test
sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we
refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it
indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the
current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.
Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be
cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on
different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP
effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of
online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the
prediction results.

akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise
continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum
method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous
differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete
optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based
optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the
continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been
comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in
continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide
additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a
first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number
of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a
result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that
allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.
As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the
directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal
linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our
theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: 该框架为在线VFL提供了有效的解决方案，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating
online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,
where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In
real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the
disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are
typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We
are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been
overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an
event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients
were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively
collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated
\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by
online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary
environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed
framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with
event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed
framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under
non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at
ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system
performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited
information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing
framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before
allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we
leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a
provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an
algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance
(e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for
ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning
models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively
verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly
executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification
methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing
approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation.
To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine
unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current
techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and
parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess
unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category,
analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify
potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a
set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a
foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded
unlearning verification mechanisms.

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed
machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy
involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential
privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often
results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue,
we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high
model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and
resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient
vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal
(non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each
iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients
for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive
asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter
than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the
notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based
on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an
improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to
differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical
results.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look
promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual
quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical
analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically
quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary
1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of
data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the
generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence
rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces
by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a
white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model.
The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically.
Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear
models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural
Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to
the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case.
Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing
generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also
demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models
whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of
black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for
measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the
Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training
machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research
established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee
convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the
aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in
whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and
investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions
from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone
do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that
reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings
due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower
bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under
box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the
number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and
$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower
bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis
for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a
$\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the
existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented
bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We
complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated
stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making.
Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of
performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early
diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood
Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining
routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that
varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing
values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation
problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding
and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type
embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values
without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the
tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an
improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose,
cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

Conclusion: cI²SB为声学FWI提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full
Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior
distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these
methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise
unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based
solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from
diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting
factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the
approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains
unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We
address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between
the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate
the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we
extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge
($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional
Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To
validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the
reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the
observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion
model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function
evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with
supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the
algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on
the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing
techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent
work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in
white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the
more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during
training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that
there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical
upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches
for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in
the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on
CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes
quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially
maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability
distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of
the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been
(i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a
supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for
enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot
account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features
in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often
do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions
with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach
for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space.
Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric,
but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The
learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances,
leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification
tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach
using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and
machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear
predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding
interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We
consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction
terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different
interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent
each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This
low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization
approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond
standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that
our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to
elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real
data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the
number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations
for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental
limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as
over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information.
While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in
Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph
nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by
increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize
the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct
characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that
counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from
points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that
architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing
paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical
justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our
findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into
their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds

bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite

\textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}.
Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce
Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the
learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints.
While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of
general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by
imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around
observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable
functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from
input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state
transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or
polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time
computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy
in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing
DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how
predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This
lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of
temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models
for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic
gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor
localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access
points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how
environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This
interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL
systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple
real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show
that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also
improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,
3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to
prior DL-based models.

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE在内存效率和隐私-效用平衡上优于传统方法。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network
training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead
due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce
DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly
reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP
approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces
three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2)
random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is
applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for
costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to
improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our
theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off
comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE
can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or
training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when
pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as
compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further
demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with

Result: 证明了ReLU DNNs可以达到最优收敛速率，且与输入维度无关。

Conclusion: 为ReLU DNNs在高维分类任务中的优异表现提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the binary classification problem on $[0,1]^d$ under
the Tsybakov noise condition (with exponent $s \in [0,\infty]$) and the
compositional assumption. This assumption requires the conditional class
probability function of the data distribution to be the composition of $q+1$
vector-valued multivariate functions, where each component function is either a
maximum value function or a H\"{o}lder-$\beta$ smooth function that depends
only on $d_*$ of its input variables. Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly
smaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions,
the optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$
\left( \frac{1}{n}
\right)^{\frac{\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}{{\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\frac{1}{s+1})\cdot\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}}}\;\;\;,
$$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$. Additionally, we
demonstrate that ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with hinge loss can
achieve this optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. This result
provides theoretical justification for the excellent performance of ReLU DNNs
in practical classification tasks, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
The technique used to establish these results extends the oracle inequality
presented in our previous work. The generalized approach is of independent
interest.

Result: DML-CMR在参数化和温和正则条件下达到最小最优收敛速率O(N^{-1/2})，并在IV回归和近端因果学习中表现优异。

Conclusion: DML-CMR在CMR问题中优于现有方法，适用于深度神经网络估计。

Abstract: Solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) is a key problem considered in
statistics, causal inference, and econometrics, where the aim is to solve for a
function of interest that satisfies some conditional moment equalities.
Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental
variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems.
Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation
is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest.
However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in
the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR
estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where
regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage
CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate
guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the
DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML)
framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal
convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity
conditions, where $N$ is the sample size. We apply DML-CMR to a range of
problems using DNN estimators, including IV regression and proximal causal
learning on real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance
against existing CMR estimators and algorithms tailored to those problems.

Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain
dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to
closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity
emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural
forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains
underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a
lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture
both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium
imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors.
After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal
fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically
meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical
labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing
performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing.
Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for
cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model
design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural
dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive
neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the
intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications,
especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various
deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise
suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation,

This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and
U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These
models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code
accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise
suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and
+364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality,
attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it
well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech.
Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific
feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and
+27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize
trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker
recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics,

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless
receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge
traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware
architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically
adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies,
including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either
demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through
gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques
rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review
architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured
state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence
models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we
explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing
both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that
ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver
adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without

Conclusion: 上下文感知的DeLaN结合MPC能有效提升复杂环境中的控制性能。

Abstract: Controlling a robot based on physics-informed dynamic models, such as deep
Lagrangian networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and
interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments,
the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical
properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a
single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system
identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant
aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation
of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility
for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,
particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model
Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it
context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system
identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed
control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the
fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our
method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our
method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21%
improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.

Abstract: Hierarchical graphs often exhibit tree-like branching patterns, a structural
property that challenges the design of traditional graph filters. We introduce
a boundary-weighted operator that rescales each edge according to how far its
endpoints drift toward the graph's Gromov boundary. Using Busemann functions on
delta-hyperbolic networks, we prove a closed-form upper bound on the operator's
spectral norm: every signal loses a curvature-controlled fraction of its energy
at each pass. The result delivers a parameter-free, lightweight filter whose
stability follows directly from geometric first principles, offering a new
analytic tool for graph signal processing on data with dense or hidden
hierarchical structure.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method to learn the time-dependent probability
density of a multivariate stochastic process from sample paths, assuming that
the initial probability density is known and can be evaluated. Our method uses
a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive
estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between
realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants.
Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent
probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value
of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally,
the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a
second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of
the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the
time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic
excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a
random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we
generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants.
Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the
necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit
approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through
applications in unsupervised outlier detection. Through several numerical
experiments, we show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs complex
time-dependent, multi-modal, and near-degenerate densities, scales effectively
to moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events among
real-world data.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the
creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition
and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation
process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.
Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can
drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the
application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.
Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained
text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the
underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the
overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,
and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen
intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a
balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the
desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the
text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's
speed.

Abstract: Combining randomized estimators in an ensemble, such as via random forests,
has become a fundamental technique in modern data science, but can be
computationally expensive. Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves
predictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the
context of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of
greedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling
-- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset.
We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly
improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful
numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as
lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to
prevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show
via numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and
degrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve
of the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of
orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the
ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic
weights, thereby enlarging the model search space. These results enhance our
understanding of random forests and suggest that implicit regularization in
general may have more complicated effects than explicit regularization.

Abstract: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of
unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused.
Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically
exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific
types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.
  To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates
static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness
generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust
libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel
approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and
generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the
fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library.
Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically,
facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly
increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We
evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20
known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities,
demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

Result: 在图形稀疏化和Wishart实例中，2D-PT表现出理想混合效率，比传统PT快几个数量级。

Conclusion: 2D-PT适用于广泛的约束Ising问题，可直接部署于现有Ising机器。

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine
learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such
as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary
optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft
constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce
feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the
powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by
adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This
scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to
low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel
tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and
eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a
representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT
achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as
O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of
magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The
method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on
existing Ising machines.

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel
testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have
traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to
challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction
model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters.
It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as
dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or
learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy
systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution
as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning
methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and
onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network
(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights
of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally
executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this
approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i)
domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target
domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task
adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the
influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies
varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully
demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data
distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy
data is concluded to be not as effective.

Result: 在大规模Favorita数据集上，深度学习路由器（InceptionTime）比单一模型基准提高了11.8%的预测精度（NWRMSLE），推理速度快4.67倍。

Conclusion: 该框架通过智能自适应AI显著优化供应链预测，减少库存短缺和浪费。

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a
critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model
accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a
Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting
model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its
unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime
routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies,
effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand
regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita
dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting
accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with
4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision
will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess
inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in
optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the
discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when
integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations.
This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent
surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian
Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and
XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational
properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their
capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield
strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average
hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary
computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of
hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic,
heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics.
Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior
outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property
correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy
positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and
data-efficient materials design.

Result: CACTUS在AMD分类中表现优于标准ML模型，能够识别关键因素并提供结果的可信度。

Conclusion: CACTUS为临床决策提供了更可靠的工具，同时通过消除偏见提高了模型的透明度和可信度。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using
Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the
data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized
separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the
definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection
process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold
using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were
evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in
science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes
challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and
numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and
traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE)
while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many
applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework
for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our
approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural
networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by
sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks,
leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the
structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of
parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We
validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal
traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience.
However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous
sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper
proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes
low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic
data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural
architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic
tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time
intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism
employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while
stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations
to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban
traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art
baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with
neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet
flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering
critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive
traffic control systems.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant
opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing
remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party
logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising
solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced
credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual
challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically,
we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through
Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for
risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible
estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk
measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these
risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To
capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate
QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit
risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering
application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid
foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets
remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse
rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active
learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational
autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity,
molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between
expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively
constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking
thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus
main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently
generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We
demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters
within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial
chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design
problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a
generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological
landscapes.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional
force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD
simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data
encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures.
Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as
a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in
material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers,
making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures.
To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a
non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy
landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including
the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework
employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a
dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a
smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene
glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving
comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to
existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT
calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without
sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for
the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing
ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how
to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While
previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked
to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that
the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we
consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled
by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and
only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split
the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination
strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm
and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph
recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove
that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with
bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective
polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments
on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and
vaccination algorithms.

Result: 在八个真实数据集上，RHO显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RHO能有效学习多样同质性，提升异常检测性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled
normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in
a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a
similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent
the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does
not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in
real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily
Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two
novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph
normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters
that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with
varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node
attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise
and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned
by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets
show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily
in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
competing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/RHO.

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and
classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a
robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is
missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do
not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences.
This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series
shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we
propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight,
quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in
amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match
between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series
comparison.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges
in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device
heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing
approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this
work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that
jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC
introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from
location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.
Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment
mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.
Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances

This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional

  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the
association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data
centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors,
and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in
stroke care.

complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges,
such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank
additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case,
it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not
possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel
activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely
resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates
SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM
methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly
available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM.

Abstract: Visual analytics using dimensionality reduction (DR) can easily be unreliable
for various reasons, e.g., inherent distortions in representing the original
data. The literature has thus proposed a wide range of methodologies to make
DR-based visual analytics reliable. However, the diversity and extensiveness of
the literature can leave novice analysts and researchers uncertain about where
to begin and proceed. To address this problem, we propose a guide for reading
papers for reliable visual analytics with DR. Relying on the previous
classification of the relevant literature, our guide helps both practitioners
to (1) assess their current DR expertise and (2) identify papers that will
further enhance their understanding. Interview studies with three experts in DR
and data visualizations validate the significance, comprehensiveness, and
usefulness of our guide.

Result: 预训练模型使模拟稳定性显著提升，轨迹持续时间延长三倍。

Conclusion: 预训练在大规模数据集上对捕捉复杂分子相互作用至关重要，力MAE不足以衡量模拟稳定性。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution
for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate
force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this
work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and
investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples)
without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset
followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force
mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower
force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the
pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability,
sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from
scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse
datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE
alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.

Result: 在蛋白质编辑和表示学习任务中表现优异，多属性编辑成功率高达61.7%。

Conclusion: DisProtEdit在保持性能的同时提高了可解释性和可控性。

Abstract: We introduce DisProtEdit, a controllable protein editing framework that
leverages dual-channel natural language supervision to learn disentangled
representations of structural and functional properties. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, DisProtEdit explicitly
separates semantic factors, enabling modular and interpretable control. To
support this, we construct SwissProtDis, a large-scale multimodal dataset where
each protein sequence is paired with two textual descriptions, one for
structure and one for function, automatically decomposed using a large language
model. DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and
uniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence
between structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing
is performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated
latent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation
learning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with
existing methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability.
On a newly constructed multi-attribute editing benchmark, the model achieves a
both-hit success rate of up to 61.7%, highlighting its effectiveness in
coordinating simultaneous structural and functional edits.

Result: 该方法能够在减少切割开销的同时保持QML模型的整体准确性，为研究更大规模的量子优势问题提供了可能。

Conclusion: 通过正则化方法，优化器能够有效平衡电路切割与模型优化的需求，为探索量子优势提供了新途径。

Abstract: Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question.
The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and
connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical
investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting
techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on
smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However,
this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the
expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to
estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel
regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the
overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables
the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the
optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the
trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall
accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in
pursuit of quantum advantage.

Abstract: Synaptic delays play a crucial role in biological neuronal networks, where
their modulation has been observed in mammalian learning processes. In the
realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to
emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do,
synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a
novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths
and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian
method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by
extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised
learning. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method by comparing
it against another existing methods for co-learning synaptic weights and delays
as well as against STDP without synaptic delays. Results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently achieves superior performance across a variety of
test scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results yield insight into the
interplay between synaptic efficacy and delay.

Method: 提出了一种基于对数扰动的新型矩阵分解方法，适用于无界输入规模，实现了平滑误差和高效计算。

Result: 算法在无界设置下实现了$O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$方差，空间复杂度为$O(t)$，每轮时间开销为$O(\log t)$，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新算法在理论和实际性能上均优于现有方法，适用于无界输入规模的差分隐私连续计数问题。

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private continual counting in the
unbounded setting where the input size $n$ is not known in advance. Current
state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix
mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only
hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick'
avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve
this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic
perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works,
which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error,
and for any $\alpha > 0$ and $t\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum
of the first $t$ data points with $O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$ variance. It
requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, compared to
$O(\log(n)\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ pre-processing
time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA
2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable
to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\times$ theirs for
$t$ as large as $2^{24}$.

Abstract: The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming
healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this
advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of
complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability
with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities
in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack
surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging.
Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on
these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant
safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices
from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of
addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the
pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device
recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat
landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient
safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques
designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive
premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed
cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices,
thereby making them safe for patients.

Abstract: We propose two first-order methods for convex, non-smooth, distributed
optimization problems, hereafter called Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding
(MT-GS) and its accelerated variant (AMT-GS). Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take
advantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the
communication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can
communicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These
three desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual
formulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in
Lan et al. (2020), Lan (2016), where different dual blocks are updated at
potentially different rates.
  To find an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution, the complexities of our algorithms
achieve optimal dependency on $\epsilon$: MT-GS needs
$O(\overline{r}A/\epsilon)$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/\epsilon^2)$ subgradient steps for Lipchitz objectives, and
AMT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu})$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/(\epsilon\mu))$ subgradient steps if the objectives are also
$\mu$-strongly convex. Here, $\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of
updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients
of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds
on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive
answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for
non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).

advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward

attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's
sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the
proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set
and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%,
demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the

does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM
implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the
negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the
binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative
samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial
Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary
SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the
lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms
the binary SVM.

metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural
corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented,
Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework
that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises
heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines)
onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a
zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi
tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within
every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and
floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under
feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage
heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of
sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile
coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income
residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission
headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for
national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated,
GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic
optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

Motivation: 解决传统Ricci-flow求解器全局更新成本高和贪婪启发式方法收敛慢或调参困难的问题。

Method: 采用贪婪的综合征解码步骤（O(E)时间）和两个轻量级神经网络模块动态选择顶点和步长。

Result: 在110个SJTU-TMQA网格上，迭代次数减少2.4倍，曲率分布更紧，UV失真与MOS相关性达-0.93，每迭代仅增加0.25ms。

Conclusion: MicroRicci适用于实时、资源受限的图形和仿真应用。

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in
graphics, simulation, and related fields.

Abstract: Ferry quays experience rapid deterioration due to their exposure to harsh
maritime environments and ferry impacts. Vibration-based structural health
monitoring offers a valuable approach to assessing structural integrity and
understanding the structural implications of these impacts. However, practical
limitations often restrict sensor placement at critical locations.
Consequently, virtual sensing techniques become essential for establishing a
Digital Twin and estimating the structural response. This study investigates
the application of the Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual
sensing on the Magerholm ferry quay, combining in-operation experimental data
collected during a ferry impact with a detailed physics-based model. The
proposed Physics-Encoded Machine Learning model integrates a reduced-order
structural model with a data-driven GPLFM representing the unknown impact
forces via their modal contributions. Significant challenges are addressed for
the development of the Digital Twin of the ferry quay, including unknown impact
characteristics (location, direction, intensity), time-varying boundary
conditions, and sparse sensor configurations. Results show that the GPLFM
provides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under
simplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during
the impact phase. Lower accuracy was observed at locations in the impact zone.
A numerical study was conducted to explore an optimal real-world sensor
placement strategy using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of sensor types,
sampling frequencies, and incorrectly assumed damping ratios. The results
suggest that the GP latent forces can help accommodate modeling and measurement
uncertainties, maintaining acceptable estimation accuracy across scenarios.

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable,
low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks.
We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a
CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference
coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static
priorities, our approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network and graph coloring
to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission
opportunities, and network conditions. Assuming that first training phase is
performed offline, our approach introduced minimal overhead, while enabling
more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and
schedulability. Simulation results show SINR gains of up to 113\%, 94\%, and
49\% over LDP across three network configurations, highlighting its
effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.

Abstract: Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems
like cars, trains or airplanes. Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for
improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization
approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing
beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a
generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict
structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model
pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to
low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data
implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential
solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required.
We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives,
including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful
construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method
generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural
vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design
heuristic and genetic optimization. The code and data are available from

Conclusion: 排序非凸惩罚在稀疏信号恢复中有效，近端算子计算方法高效且实用。

Abstract: This work studies the problem of sparse signal recovery with automatic
grouping of variables. To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties
as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a
family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm
(SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to
their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of
coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal
operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite
optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish
between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the
proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where
computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial
problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how
the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal
operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that
a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to
tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new
theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem. We
demonstrate the practical interest of using such penalties on several
experiments.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of
fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time
settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step,
input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for
learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector
field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along
with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to
estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are
then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed
approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems.
The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the
system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn
equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that
fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
the limitations of integer-order representations.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as
Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral
Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases.
Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to
measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This
work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine
learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc)
obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was
sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data
in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However,
most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive,
requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we
implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This
paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for
regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM,
$\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for
10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support
Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of
$\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with
$\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position
the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications,
particularly in a data-constrained environment.

Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks,
over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising
the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by
incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase
and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is
exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as
heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization
Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance.
Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by
employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB
observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of
the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models:
Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder
(CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all
datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal
by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08%
F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important
research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has
demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation
remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a
theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family
of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to
Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the
theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with
decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces
a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only
demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to
natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$,
allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and
constrained optimization algorithms.
