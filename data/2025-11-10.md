TL;DR: ATLAS是一个基于项目反应理论(IRT)的自适应测试框架，通过Fisher信息引导的项目选择来估计模型能力，能在保持测量精度的同时减少90%的测试项目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型评估需要数千个基准项目，成本高且效率低。现有方法对所有项目一视同仁，忽略了项目质量和信息量的差异，且存在标注错误问题。

Method: 使用项目反应理论(IRT)和Fisher信息指导的项目选择，动态选择最具信息量的测试项目来估计模型能力。

Result: 在HellaSwag基准上仅用42个项目(原5,608个)就达到全基准估计精度(MAE 0.154)；项目暴露率低于10%，测试重叠率16-27%；IRT排名与传统准确率排名存在显著差异，23-31%的模型排名变化超过10位。

Conclusion: 自适应测试框架ATLAS能大幅提高评估效率，同时发现传统静态基准存在标注错误和排名偏差问题。

Abstract: Large language model evaluation requires thousands of benchmark items, making
evaluations expensive and slow. Existing methods compute average accuracy
across fixed item sets, treating all items equally despite varying quality and
informativeness. We present ATLAS an adaptive testing framework using Item
Response Theory (IRT) to estimate model ability through Fisher
information-guided item selection. Our analysis of five major benchmarks
reveals that 3-6% of items exhibit negative discrimination, indicating
annotation errors that corrupt static evaluation. ATLAS achieves 90% item
reduction while maintaining measurement precision: on HellaSwag (5,608 items),
we match full-benchmark estimates using only 42 items with 0.154 MAE. Our
framework maintains item exposure rates below 10% and test overlap at 16-27%,
compared to static benchmarks where every model sees all items (100% exposure).
Among 4,000+ tested models, IRT ranks differ from accuracy ranks: models with
the same accuracy get different IRT scores, and 23-31% of all models shift by
more than 10 rank positions. Code and calibrated item banks are available at
https://github.com/Peiyu-Georgia-Li/ATLAS.git.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将指令层次解析重构为推理任务，通过构建VerIH数据集和轻量级强化学习训练，使LLM能够优先遵循更高优先级的系统指令，从而提高模型的可靠性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在现实世界决策中承担重要角色，需要处理来自多个来源的竞争性指令。强制执行指令层次结构对于LLM的可靠性和可控性至关重要。

Method: 构建VerIH指令层次数据集，包含对齐和冲突的系统-用户指令，使用轻量级强化学习训练模型，将一般推理能力转移到指令优先级处理上。

Result: 微调后的模型在指令遵循和指令层次基准测试中取得一致改进，推理能力可泛化到安全关键场景，增强了对越狱和提示注入攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过指令层次推理为可靠LLM提供了实用路径，系统提示的更新可产生可控且鲁棒的模型行为变化。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based systems take on high-stakes roles in
real-world decision-making, they must reconcile competing instructions from
multiple sources (e.g., model developers, users, and tools) within a single
prompt context. Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where
higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the
reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction
hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first
"think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority
(system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability
via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of
constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both
aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight
reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning
capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models
achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction
hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to
safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety
issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined
higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against
jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that
reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable
LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in
model behavior.

TL;DR: WinnowRAG是一个新颖的检索增强生成框架，通过两阶段处理解决多文档检索中的噪声问题：第一阶段进行查询感知聚类和代理生成，第二阶段通过批判LLM进行筛选和合并，保留有用文档。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成(RAG)通过整合外部知识源增强LLM，但增加检索文档数量会引入噪声，降低生成准确性。需要一种方法在保留有价值内容的同时过滤噪声文档。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 查询感知聚类，每个集群由LLM代理生成答案；2) 筛选阶段，批判LLM评估多个代理输出，通过战略合并技术保留有用文档。模型无关且无需微调。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，WinnowRAG优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: WinnowRAG有效解决了多文档RAG中的噪声问题，通过系统化的筛选和合并策略提高了生成质量，且具有良好的适应性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge sources to address their limitations in
accessing up-to-date or specialized information. A natural strategy to increase
the likelihood of retrieving relevant information is to expand the number of
retrieved documents. However, involving more documents could introduce
significant noise, as many documents may be irrelevant or misleading, thereby
reducing the overall accuracy of the generated responses. To overcome the
challenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose
WinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy
documents while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as
winnowing. WinnowRAG operates in two stages: In Stage I, we perform query-aware
clustering to group similar documents and form distinct topic clusters. Each
cluster is assigned to an LLM agent for generating a unique answer. In Stage
II, we perform winnowing, wherein a critic LLM evaluates the outputs of
multiple agents and iteratively separates useful documents from noisy ones. To
retain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic
merging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for
generating the final response. Crucially, WinnowRAG is model-agnostic and does
not require any model fine-tuning, making it easily adaptable to various tasks.
Extensive experiments on various realistic datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of WinnowRAG over state-of-the-art baselines.

Reliably measuring abstract and complex phenomena such as 'safety' and

Abstract: Identifying how training samples influence/impact Large Language Model (LLM)
decision-making is essential for effectively interpreting model decisions and
auditing large-scale datasets. Current training sample influence estimation
methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing
information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order
gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of
billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to
some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal
work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for
computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers
are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on
influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work,
we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the
cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better
estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of
aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to
standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to
significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for
evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model
retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR)
that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect.
Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we
concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than
the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior
knowledge in the field.

Motivation: 在RLVR训练中，随着模型规模扩大和训练时间延长，越来越多的提示变成残差提示（奖励方差为零），这些提示无法提供训练信号，降低了训练多样性和效果。

Result: 在Qwen2.5系列模型上的实验表明，ERPO在多个数学推理基准测试中一致超越了强基线方法。

Conclusion: ERPO能够有效利用残差提示，通过探索策略重新激活训练信号，提升RLVR训练的效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an
effective approach for improving the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs). The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) family has
demonstrated strong performance in training LLMs with RLVR. However, as models
train longer and scale larger, more training prompts become residual prompts,
those with zero variance rewards that provide no training signal. Consequently,
fewer prompts contribute to training, reducing diversity and hindering
effectiveness. To fully exploit these residual prompts, we propose the Explore
Residual Prompts in Policy Optimization (ERPO) framework, which encourages
exploration on residual prompts and reactivates their training signals. ERPO
maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adaptively increases the
sampling temperature for residual prompts that previously produced all correct
responses. This encourages the model to generate more diverse reasoning traces,
introducing incorrect responses that revive training signals. Empirical results
on the Qwen2.5 series demonstrate that ERPO consistently surpasses strong
baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack meaningful confidence estimates for
their outputs. While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it
remains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of
their responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain
sampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably
well-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain
question-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our
main theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic
calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a
recent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory
relies on a general definition of "B-calibration," which is a notion of
calibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or
otherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base
LLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own
distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We
state three implications of this prediction, which we validate through
experiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across
question-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this
calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration. To our
knowledge, our work provides the first principled explanation of when and why
semantic calibration emerges in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that LLMs can exhibit behavioral self-awareness:
the ability to accurately describe or predict their own learned behaviors
without explicit supervision. This capability raises safety concerns as it may,
for example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during
evaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such
self-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it
manifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs
with low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably
induced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware
behavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation
space, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that
self-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent
representations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral
self-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily
induced and modulated.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory
constraints when processing long contexts, despite growing demand for
applications requiring reasoning over extensive documents, multi-session
dialogues, and book length texts. While recent advances have extended context
windows to 100K-1M tokens, such approaches incur prohibitive costs for resource
constrained deployments. We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented
architecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything.
Our system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience
scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide
which information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike
existing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks,
BudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval
for efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700
question answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens)
documents with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves
remarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while
saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through
budget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline
comparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits
increase with document length. Our work provides a practical pathway for
deploying capable long context systems on modest hardware, democratizing access
to advanced language understanding capabilities.

Motivation: 现代LLMs越来越多地被用于创意生成，包括模拟虚构角色，但其扮演非亲社会、敌对角色的能力尚未得到充分研究。作者假设LLMs的安全对齐与真实扮演道德模糊或反派角色之间存在根本冲突。

Method: 引入Moral RolePlay基准，包含四级道德对齐量表和平衡测试集，让最先进的LLMs扮演从道德典范到纯粹反派的各种角色，进行大规模评估。

Result: 评估显示随着角色道德水平下降，角色扮演保真度呈单调下降趋势。模型在与安全原则直接对立的特质（如"欺骗性"和"操纵性"）上表现最差，往往用表面的攻击性替代细微的恶意。高度安全对齐的模型在反派角色扮演方面表现特别差。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次系统证明了LLMs在反派角色扮演方面的关键局限性，揭示了模型安全性与创意保真度之间的紧张关系，为开发更细致、上下文感知的对齐方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with creative
generation, including the simulation of fictional characters. However, their
ability to portray non-prosocial, antagonistic personas remains largely
unexamined. We hypothesize that the safety alignment of modern LLMs creates a
fundamental conflict with the task of authentically role-playing morally
ambiguous or villainous characters. To investigate this, we introduce the Moral
RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale
and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs
with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our
large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing
fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most
with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful''
and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial
aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a
poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned
models performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic
evidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model
safety and creative fidelity. Our benchmark and findings pave the way for
developing more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to a universal set of
safety and usage principles intended for broad public acceptability. Yet,
real-world applications of LLMs often take place within organizational
ecosystems shaped by distinctive corporate policies, regulatory requirements,
use cases, brand guidelines, and ethical commitments. This reality highlights
the need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs with pluralistic
alignment goals, an alignment paradigm that emphasizes adaptability to diverse
user values and needs. In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE
(PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs'
capacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn,
interactive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300
realistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic
evaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral
specifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that
leading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral
policies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their
compliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to
84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and
safety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic
behavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions. Our work contributes both
the dataset and analytical framework to support future research toward robust
and context-aware pluralistic alignment techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore an important yet previously neglected question: Do
context aggregation patterns across Language Models (LMs) share commonalities?
While some works have investigated context aggregation or attention weights in
LMs, they typically focus on individual models or attention heads, lacking a
systematic analysis across multiple LMs to explore their commonalities. In
contrast, we focus on the commonalities among LMs, which can deepen our
understanding of LMs and even facilitate cross-model knowledge transfer. In
this work, we introduce the Order-Level Attention (OLA) derived from the
order-wise decomposition of Attention Rollout and reveal that the OLA at the
same order across LMs exhibits significant similarities. Furthermore, we
discover an implicit mapping between OLA and syntactic knowledge. Based on
these two findings, we propose the Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA), a
training-free cross-LM adapter transfer method. Specifically, we treat the OLA
as a unified syntactic feature representation and train an adapter that takes
OLA as input. Due to the similarities in OLA across LMs, the adapter
generalizes to unseen LMs without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TOA's cross-LM generalization effectively enhances
the performance of unseen LMs. Code is available at

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B模型上，层数从36层减少到28层（参数2.47B）时质量损失仅9.7%，减少到24层时损失18%。发现中间transformer层对推理贡献较小。

Conclusion: 迭代蒸馏和微调方法有效，适合资源受限环境部署，证明了中间层可压缩的潜力。

Abstract: This work investigates distillation methods for large language models (LLMs)
with the goal of developing compact models that preserve high performance.
Several existing approaches are reviewed, with a discussion of their respective
strengths and limitations. An improved method based on the ShortGPT approach
has been developed, building upon the idea of incorporating iterative
evaluation of layer importance. At each step, importance is assessed by
measuring performance degradation when individual layers are removed, using a
set of representative datasets. This process is combined with further training
using a joint loss function based on KL divergence and mean squared error.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-3B model show that the number of layers can be
reduced from 36 to 28 (resulting in a 2.47 billion parameter model) with only a
9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with an 18% loss. The findings suggest that
the middle transformer layers contribute less to inference, underscoring the
potential of the proposed method for creating efficient models. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of iterative distillation and fine-tuning, making
the approach suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings.

TL;DR: 这篇论文发现多语言数学基准测试MGSM中存在翻译错误和答案提取不规范的问题，导致之前观察到的LLM跨语言性能差距实际上是数据质量问题造成的假象。作者提出了自动质量保证方法和标准化答案提取建议，修正后语言性能差距基本消失。

Motivation: 研究LLM在不同语言数学能力上的表现差异，特别是验证高资源和低资源语言之间是否存在性能差距。

Method: 分析标准多语言数学基准MGSM的数据质量，发现翻译错误；提出自动质量保证方法解决翻译问题，并给出标准化答案提取建议。

Result: 修正数据质量和答案提取方法后，之前观察到的语言性能差距基本消失，得出了与原始研究完全不同的结论。

Conclusion: LLM跨语言性能差距主要是由基准测试数据质量问题造成的假象，而非模型能力差异。

Abstract: Most current large language models (LLMs) support a wide variety of languages
in addition to English, including high-resource languages (e.g. German,
Chinese, French), as well as low-resource ones (e.g. Swahili, Telugu). In
addition they have also shown impressive capabilities in different domains,
like coding, science and math. In this short paper, taking math as an example
domain, we study the performance of different LLMs across languages.
Experimental results show that there exists a non-negligible and consistent gap
in the performance of the models across languages. Interestingly, and somewhat
against expectations, the gap exists for both high- and low-resource languages.
We hope that these results influence further research into cross-lingual
capability generalization for next generation LLMs. If it weren't for the fact
that they are false! By analyzing one of the standard multilingual math
benchmarks (MGSM), we determine that several translation errors are present in
the data. Furthermore, the lack of standardized answer extraction from LLM
outputs further influences the final results. We propose a method for automatic
quality assurance to address the first issue at scale, and give recommendations
to address the second one. Combining these two approaches we show that the
aforementioned language gap mostly disappears, leading to completely different
conclusions from our research. We additionally release the corrected dataset to
the community.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a widely used method to improve the
reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). More recently, CoT has
been leveraged in Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer reasoning capability
from a larger LLM to a smaller one. This paper examines the role of CoT in
distilling the reasoning capability from larger LLMs to smaller LLMs using
white-box KD, analysing its effectiveness in improving the performance of the
distilled models for various natural language reasoning and understanding
tasks. We conduct white-box KD experiments using LLMs from the Qwen and Llama2
families, employing CoT data from the CoT-Collection dataset. The distilled
models are then evaluated on natural language reasoning and understanding tasks
from the BIG-Bench-Hard (BBH) benchmark, which presents complex challenges for
smaller LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the role of CoT in improving
white-box KD effectiveness, enabling the distilled models to achieve better
average performance in natural language reasoning and understanding tasks from
BBH.

Motivation: 现有黑盒LLM个性化方法依赖上下文注入，让模型同时承担内容生成和风格对齐双重任务，导致输出质量下降和控制精度有限

Method: 两阶段框架：1)基础模型生成通用高质量回复；2)反射模块重写输出以对齐用户偏好。反射模块采用监督微调+强化学习的两阶段训练

Result: 在LaMP基准测试中显著优于现有最优方法，证明显式响应重塑优于隐式上下文注入

Conclusion: RPO通过解耦内容生成和个性化，提供高效、模型无关的个性化层，为用户中心生成场景开辟新方向

Abstract: The personalization of black-box large language models (LLMs) is a critical
yet challenging task. Existing approaches predominantly rely on context
injection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the
generation process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on
the model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with
user-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output
quality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we
propose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that
redefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from
alignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a
high-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly
rewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection
module is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning
is employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core
personalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to
user-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to
further refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs.
Comprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by
decoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of
explicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO
introduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be
seamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new
and effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为对比权重引导的简单后训练方法，通过权重算术编辑模型参数，利用狭窄训练数据更好地控制LLM行为。该方法通过减去两个小规模微调的权重增量来隔离行为方向，然后添加或移除该方向来修改模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为LLM提供多样化训练分布的高质量反馈既困难又昂贵，而仅在狭窄分布上提供反馈可能导致意外的泛化问题。需要一种方法能够更好地利用狭窄训练数据来控制模型行为。

Method: 对比权重引导：通过两个小规模微调（一个诱导期望行为，一个诱导相反行为）的权重增量相减来隔离行为方向，然后通过权重算术添加或移除该方向来编辑模型参数。

Result: 权重引导比激活引导具有更好的泛化能力，在保持通用能力的同时实现更强的分布外行为控制；能够减少微调中引入的阿谀奉承和不足拒绝行为，同时保持任务性能增益；初步证据表明可以通过测量微调更新与'邪恶'权重方向的相似性来检测新兴的不对齐。

Conclusion: 权重引导是一种有效的后训练方法，能够更好地利用狭窄训练数据来控制LLM行为，在行为控制和能力保持之间取得更好平衡，并为检测训练过程中的不对齐行为提供了可能途径。

Abstract: Providing high-quality feedback to Large Language Models (LLMs) on a diverse
training distribution can be difficult and expensive, and providing feedback
only on a narrow distribution can result in unintended generalizations. To
better leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a
simple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight
arithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the
weight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired
behavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this
direction to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate
sycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often
generalizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger
out-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities.
We also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering
can partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and
under-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance
gains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can
be detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an
"evil" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the
evolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that
never manifest during training or evaluations.

Conclusion: 通过在多智能体交互环境中统一隐私和安全，ConVerse将安全重新定义为通信的涌现属性。

Abstract: As language models evolve into autonomous agents that act and communicate on
behalf of users, ensuring safety in multi-agent ecosystems becomes a central
challenge. Interactions between personal assistants and external service
providers expose a core tension between utility and protection: effective
collaboration requires information sharing, yet every exchange creates new
attack surfaces. We introduce ConVerse, a dynamic benchmark for evaluating
privacy and security risks in agent-agent interactions. ConVerse spans three
practical domains (travel, real estate, insurance) with 12 user personas and
over 864 contextually grounded attacks (611 privacy, 253 security). Unlike
prior single-agent settings, it models autonomous, multi-turn agent-to-agent
conversations where malicious requests are embedded within plausible discourse.
Privacy is tested through a three-tier taxonomy assessing abstraction quality,
while security attacks target tool use and preference manipulation. Evaluating
seven state-of-the-art models reveals persistent vulnerabilities; privacy
attacks succeed in up to 88% of cases and security breaches in up to 60%, with
stronger models leaking more. By unifying privacy and security within
interactive multi-agent contexts, ConVerse reframes safety as an emergent
property of communication.

Result: 模型性能随序列长度增加而下降，反映了更长程序的复杂性。输入中步骤位移越大（对应更严重的打乱），性能进一步恶化。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在程序性推理方面存在局限性，特别是在处理更长和更无序的输入时。

Abstract: Reasoning over procedural sequences, where the order of steps directly
impacts outcomes, is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs). In
this work, we study the task of reconstructing globally ordered sequences from
shuffled procedural steps, using a curated dataset of food recipes, a domain
where correct sequencing is essential for task success. We evaluate several
LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings and present a comprehensive
evaluation framework that adapts established metrics from ranking and sequence
alignment. These include Kendall's Tau, Normalized Longest Common Subsequence
(NLCS), and Normalized Edit Distance (NED), which capture complementary aspects
of ordering quality. Our analysis shows that model performance declines with
increasing sequence length, reflecting the added complexity of longer
procedures. We also find that greater step displacement in the input,
corresponding to more severe shuffling, leads to further degradation. These
findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in procedural reasoning,
especially with longer and more disordered inputs.

Abstract: Large language model agents are becoming increasingly capable at web-centric
tasks such as information retrieval, complex reasoning. These emerging
capabilities have given rise to surge research interests in developing LLM
agent for facilitating scientific quest. One key application in AI research is
to automate experiment design through agentic dataset and baseline retrieval.
However, prior efforts suffer from limited data coverage, as recommendation
datasets primarily harvest candidates from public portals and omit many
datasets actually used in published papers, and from an overreliance on content
similarity that biases model toward superficial similarity and overlooks
experimental suitability. Harnessing collective perception embedded in the
baseline and dataset citation network, we present a comprehensive framework for
baseline and dataset recommendation. First, we design an automated
data-collection pipeline that links roughly one hundred thousand accepted
papers to the baselines and datasets they actually used. Second, we propose a
collective perception enhanced retriever. To represent the position of each
dataset or baseline within the scholarly network, it concatenates
self-descriptions with aggregated citation contexts. To achieve efficient
candidate recall, we finetune an embedding model on these representations.
Finally, we develop a reasoning-augmented reranker that exact interaction
chains to construct explicit reasoning chains and finetunes a large language
model to produce interpretable justifications and refined rankings. The dataset
we curated covers 85\% of the datasets and baselines used at top AI conferences
over the past five years. On our dataset, the proposed method outperforms the
strongest prior baseline with average gains of +5.85\% in Recall@20, +8.30\% in
HitRate@5. Taken together, our results advance reliable, interpretable

Abstract: Long context inference scenarios have become increasingly important for large

prior research has optimized long-sequence inference through operators, model
architectures, and system frameworks, tokenization remains an overlooked
bottleneck. Existing parallel tokenization methods accelerate processing
through text segmentation and multi-process tokenization, but they suffer from
inconsistent results due to boundary artifacts that occur after merging. To
address this, we propose LoPT, a novel Lossless Parallel Tokenization framework
that ensures output identical to standard sequential tokenization. Our approach
employs character-position-based matching and dynamic chunk length adjustment
to align and merge tokenized segments accurately. Extensive experiments across
diverse long-text datasets demonstrate that LoPT achieves significant speedup
while guaranteeing lossless tokenization. We also provide theoretical proof of
consistency and comprehensive analytical studies to validate the robustness of
our method.

Result: Mistral在SARI指标上达到42.46，BERTScore为0.91，表现出更好的可读性与准确性平衡；QWen的BERTScore显著较低为0.89。分析还发现五个可读性指标存在功能冗余。

Conclusion: 指令调优的Mistral 24B更适合文本简化任务，词汇支持是简化的主要领域适应问题，研究为指标选择提供了必要启发。

Abstract: The increasing health-seeking behavior and digital consumption of biomedical
information by the general public necessitate scalable solutions for
automatically adapting complex scientific and technical documents into plain
language. Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large
language models, however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating
the tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring
preservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses the
performance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their
linguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a
human benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral
24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential
architectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a
tempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a
suite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46),
while preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also
attains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a
disconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a
statistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a
comprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability,
discourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for
mechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five
readability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the
evolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the
instruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics
for metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary
domain-adaptation issue for simplification.

Method: 1) 将进化分解为不同步骤以增强进化控制；2) 引入基于LLM的评判器验证进化结果；3) 整合人类反馈来优化进化算子；4) 开发保持性能但降低计算开销的高效评估策略。

Result: 该方法在优化质量和效率方面都有显著提升，代码已开源以支持新任务的提示优化和进一步研究。

Conclusion: 提出的改进方法能够有效提升进化提示优化的性能，为通用提示优化提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Evolutionary prompt optimization has demonstrated effectiveness in refining
prompts for LLMs. However, existing approaches lack robust operators and
efficient evaluation mechanisms. In this work, we propose several key
improvements to evolutionary prompt optimization that can partially generalize
to prompt optimization in general: 1) decomposing evolution into distinct steps
to enhance the evolution and its control, 2) introducing an LLM-based judge to
verify the evolutions, 3) integrating human feedback to refine the evolutionary
operator, and 4) developing more efficient evaluation strategies that maintain
performance while reducing computational overhead. Our approach improves both
optimization quality and efficiency. We release our code, enabling prompt
optimization on new tasks and facilitating further research in this area.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架来建模用户满意度估计中的个体和群体偏好，包括个性化推理链、无监督用户群体发现和偏好自适应强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话系统对齐方法通常训练一刀切模型，追求广泛共识，但忽视了少数群体视角和用户特定适应性，导致少数用户满意度评分与多数用户不同。

Method: 1) Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning (CoPeR) 通过可解释推理链捕捉个体偏好；2) 基于期望最大化的多数-少数偏好感知聚类算法(M2PC)无监督发现用户群体；3) 偏好自适应强化学习框架(PAda-PPO)联合优化个体和群体偏好对齐。

Result: 在情感支持对话数据集上的实验表明，在用户满意度估计方面取得了持续改进，特别是对于代表性不足的用户群体。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效建模个体和群体层面的用户偏好，显著提升对话系统的用户满意度估计性能，特别是对少数群体的改进效果明显。

Abstract: User satisfaction in dialogue systems is inherently subjective. When the same
response strategy is applied across users, minority users may assign different
satisfaction ratings than majority users due to variations in individual
intents and preferences. However, existing alignment methods typically train
one-size-fits-all models that aim for broad consensus, often overlooking
minority perspectives and user-specific adaptation. We propose a unified
framework that models both individual- and group-level preferences for user
satisfaction estimation. First, we introduce Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning
(CoPeR) to capture individual preferences through interpretable reasoning
chains. Second, we propose an expectation-maximization-based Majority-Minority
Preference-Aware Clustering (M2PC) algorithm that discovers distinct user
groups in an unsupervised manner to learn group-level preferences. Finally, we
integrate these components into a preference-adaptive reinforcement learning
framework (PAda-PPO) that jointly optimizes alignment with both individual and
group preferences. Experiments on the Emotional Support Conversation dataset
demonstrate consistent improvements in user satisfaction estimation,
particularly for underrepresented user groups.

TL;DR: RADAR是一个基于检索增强诊断推理的智能体系统，用于脑MRI罕见疾病检测。该系统通过嵌入病例报告和医学文献，使用FAISS进行高效相似性搜索，为LLM提供临床相关证据来指导诊断决策，无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见疾病在医学影像中属于长尾分布，AI模型由于缺乏代表性训练数据而经常失败。受放射科医生在遇到不熟悉发现时查阅病例报告和文献的启发，开发了RADAR系统。

Method: 使用AI智能体访问外部医学知识，通过句子转换器嵌入病例报告和文献，并用FAISS索引实现高效相似性搜索。作为模型无关的推理模块，可与各种大型语言模型无缝集成。

Result: 在包含280种不同罕见疾病的NOVA数据集上，RADAR实现了高达10.2%的性能提升，对开源模型（如DeepSeek）的提升最为显著。检索到的示例提供了可解释的、基于文献的解释。

Conclusion: 检索增强推理是医学影像中低流行率条件的有力范式，不仅提高了准确性，还增强了可解释性。

Abstract: Rare diseases represent the long tail of medical imaging, where AI models
often fail due to the scarcity of representative training data. In clinical
workflows, radiologists frequently consult case reports and literature when
confronted with unfamiliar findings. Following this line of reasoning, we
introduce RADAR, Retrieval Augmented Diagnostic Reasoning Agents, an agentic
system for rare disease detection in brain MRI. Our approach uses AI agents
with access to external medical knowledge by embedding both case reports and
literature using sentence transformers and indexing them with FAISS to enable
efficient similarity search. The agent retrieves clinically relevant evidence
to guide diagnostic decision making on unseen diseases, without the need of
additional training. Designed as a model-agnostic reasoning module, RADAR can
be seamlessly integrated with diverse large language models, consistently
improving their rare pathology recognition and interpretability. On the NOVA
dataset comprising 280 distinct rare diseases, RADAR achieves up to a 10.2%
performance gain, with the strongest improvements observed for open source
models such as DeepSeek. Beyond accuracy, the retrieved examples provide
interpretable, literature grounded explanations, highlighting
retrieval-augmented reasoning as a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence

Conclusion: 提出的数据处理流程为开发其他专业领域的高性能编码器提供了可复现的范例。

Abstract: While large general-purpose Transformer-based encoders excel at general
language understanding, their performance diminishes in specialized domains
like manufacturing due to a lack of exposure to domain-specific terminology and
semantics. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing ManufactuBERT, a
RoBERTa model continually pretrained on a large-scale corpus curated for the
manufacturing domain. We present a comprehensive data processing pipeline to
create this corpus from web data, involving an initial domain-specific
filtering step followed by a multi-stage deduplication process that removes
redundancies. Our experiments show that ManufactuBERT establishes a new
state-of-the-art on a range of manufacturing-related NLP tasks, outperforming
strong specialized baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that training on
our carefully deduplicated corpus significantly accelerates convergence,
leading to a 33\% reduction in training time and computational cost compared to
training on the non-deduplicated dataset. The proposed pipeline offers a
reproducible example for developing high-performing encoders in other
specialized domains. We will release our model and curated corpus at

Conclusion: 通过将叙事框架与具体实体关联的微调BERT模型，能够有效解决现有大语言模型在处理非结构化播客数据时的局限性，为分析数字媒体中的说服和影响机制提供了更准确的方法。

Abstract: Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them
a vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically
unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex
form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine
their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.
  The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant
challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models,
typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to
capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative
frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing
podcast narratives at scale.
  To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that
explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the
conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our
approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with
high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions
of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely
aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new
analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being
discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a
more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.

Result: 基础正则表达式方法仅在40.5%的判决中识别出描述，而高级正则表达式达到97%，LLM达到98.75%，组合方法达到99.5%。法学学生评估显示，高级方法在约90%的情况下与人工标注匹配，而基础方法仅为34.5%。

Conclusion: LLM和高级正则表达式方法都能有效从法院判决书中提取犯罪行为描述，组合方法效果最佳，为刑事司法研究提供了有价值的数据提取工具。

Abstract: Criminal justice administrative data contain only a limited amount of
information about the committed offense. However, there is an unused source of
extensive information in continental European courts' decisions: descriptions
of criminal behaviors in verdicts by which offenders are found guilty. In this
paper, we study the feasibility of extracting these descriptions from publicly
available court decisions from Slovakia. We use two different approaches for
retrieval: regular expressions and large language models (LLMs). Our baseline
was a simple method employing regular expressions to identify typical words
occurring before and after the description. The advanced regular expression
approach further focused on "sparing" and its normalization (insertion of
spaces between individual letters), typical for delineating the description.
The LLM approach involved prompting the Gemini Flash 2.0 model to extract the
descriptions using predefined instructions. Although the baseline identified
descriptions in only 40.5% of verdicts, both methods significantly outperformed
it, achieving 97% with advanced regular expressions and 98.75% with LLMs, and
99.5% when combined. Evaluation by law students showed that both advanced
methods matched human annotations in about 90% of cases, compared to just 34.5%
for the baseline. LLMs fully matched human-labeled descriptions in 91.75% of
instances, and a combination of advanced regular expressions with LLMs reached
92%.

potential in cybersecurity due to their advanced capabilities in text

retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to obtain threat intelligence by combining
real-time information retrieval with domain-specific data. The proposed system,
RAGRecon, uses a LLM with RAG to answer questions about cybersecurity threats.
Moreover, it makes this form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) explainable by
generating and visually presenting to the user a knowledge graph for every
reply. This increases the transparency and interpretability of the reasoning of
the model, allowing analysts to better understand the connections made by the
system based on the context recovered by the RAG system. We evaluated RAGRecon

Abstract: The early detection of mental health disorders from social media text is
critical for enabling timely support, risk assessment, and referral to
appropriate resources. This work introduces multiMentalRoBERTa, a fine-tuned
RoBERTa model designed for multiclass classification of common mental health
conditions, including stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and neutral discourse. Drawing on multiple
curated datasets, data exploration is conducted to analyze class overlaps,
revealing strong correlations between depression and suicidal ideation as well
as anxiety and PTSD, while stress emerges as a broad, overlapping category.
Comparative experiments with traditional machine learning methods,
domain-specific transformers, and prompting-based large language models
demonstrate that multiMentalRoBERTa achieves superior performance, with macro
F1-scores of 0.839 in the six-class setup and 0.870 in the five-class setup
(excluding stress), outperforming both fine-tuned MentalBERT and baseline
classifiers. Beyond predictive accuracy, explainability methods, including
Layer Integrated Gradients and KeyBERT, are applied to identify lexical cues
that drive classification, with a particular focus on distinguishing depression
from suicidal ideation. The findings emphasize the effectiveness of fine-tuned
transformers for reliable and interpretable detection in sensitive contexts,
while also underscoring the importance of fairness, bias mitigation, and
human-in-the-loop safety protocols. Overall, multiMentalRoBERTa is presented as
a lightweight, robust, and deployable solution for enhancing support in mental
health platforms.

Result: 所有方法表现都合理，但BengaliBPE提供了最详细的分割和最佳的形态可解释性，尽管计算成本略高。

Conclusion: 研究强调了语言感知分词对形态丰富语言的重要性，BengaliBPE为未来孟加拉语NLP系统（包括大规模预训练语言模型）奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Tokenization is an important first step in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
pipelines because it decides how models learn and represent linguistic
information. However, current subword tokenizers like SentencePiece or
HuggingFace BPE are mostly designed for Latin or multilingual corpora and do
not perform well on languages with rich morphology such as Bengali. To address
this limitation, we present BengaliBPE, a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer
specifically developed for the Bengali script. BengaliBPE applies Unicode
normalization, grapheme-level initialization, and morphology-aware merge rules
to maintain linguistic consistency and preserve subword integrity. We use a
large-scale Bengali news classification dataset to compare BengaliBPE with
three baselines: Whitespace, SentencePiece BPE, and HuggingFace BPE. The
evaluation considers tokenization granularity, encoding speed, and downstream
classification accuracy. While all methods perform reasonably well, BengaliBPE
provides the most detailed segmentation and the best morphological
interpretability, albeit with slightly higher computational cost. These
findings highlight the importance of language-aware tokenization for
morphologically rich scripts and establish BengaliBPE as a strong foundation
for future Bengali NLP systems, including large-scale pretraining of contextual
language models.

caption-trained n-gram LM, humans display roughly twice the surprisal variance
of models, but rescoring the same captions with a general-language model
reverses the pattern. Our analysis introduces the surprisal-based diversity
metric for image captioning. We show that relying on a single scorer can
completely invert conclusions, thus, robust diversity evaluation must report

Abstract: Knowledge about emotional events is an important kind of knowledge which has
been applied to improve the effectiveness of different applications. However,
emotional events cannot be easily acquired, especially common or generalized
emotional events that are context-independent. The goal of this paper is to
obtain common emotional events in Chinese language such as "win a prize" and
"be criticized". Our approach begins by collecting a comprehensive list of
Chinese emotional event indicators. Then, we generate emotional events by
prompting a Chinese large language model (LLM) using these indicators. To
ensure the quality of these emotional events, we train a filter to discard
invalid generated results. We also classify these emotional events as being
positive events and negative events using different techniques. Finally, we
harvest a total of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events with sentiment
polarity labels, which is the only large-scale commonsense knowledge base of
emotional events in Chinese language. Intrinsic evaluation results show that
the proposed method in this paper can be effectively used to acquire common
Chinese emotional events. An extrinsic use case also demonstrates the strong
potential of common emotional events in the field of emotion cause extraction
(ECE). Related resources including emotional event indicators and emotional

### [40] [Translation via Annotation: A Computational Study of Translating Classical Chinese into Japanese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05239)
*Zilong Li,Jie Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 35.0

TL;DR: 该研究将古汉语日译的字符标注过程抽象为序列标注任务，构建了基于大语言模型的标注流程和新数据集，在低资源环境下通过引入辅助中文NLP任务提升序列标注性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究古代汉语到日语的翻译标注系统面临低资源问题，需要开发有效的现代语言技术解决方案。

Method: 提出基于大语言模型的标注流程，从数字化开源翻译数据构建新数据集，并在低资源设置下引入辅助中文NLP任务来提升序列标注训练效果。

Result: 大语言模型在直接机器翻译中表现优异，但在字符标注任务中表现不佳；所提方法可作为大语言模型的补充方案。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的标注流程和辅助任务策略在低资源古汉语翻译标注任务中有效，为传统翻译标注系统提供了现代技术解决方案。

Abstract: Ancient people translated classical Chinese into Japanese by annotating
around each character. We abstract this process as sequence tagging tasks and
fit them into modern language technologies. The research of this annotation and
translation system is a facing low-resource problem. We release this problem by
introducing a LLM-based annotation pipeline and construct a new dataset from
digitalized open-source translation data. We show that under the low-resource
setting, introducing auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks has a promoting effect on the
training of sequence tagging tasks. We also evaluate the performance of large
language models. They achieve high scores in direct machine translation, but
they are confused when being asked to annotate characters. Our method could
work as a supplement of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用患者自述中保留的临床信号进行疾病诊断，这些信号在结构化电子病历中往往被削弱或遗漏，特别是细微但重要的细节

Method: 构建MIMIC-SR-ICD11数据集，并提出LL-Rank重排序框架，通过计算条件似然减去先验似然来评估标签与临床报告的语义兼容性

Result: 在七个模型骨干上，LL-Rank始终优于强基线方法GenMap，消融实验显示其优势主要来自基于PMI的评分机制

Conclusion: LL-Rank通过隔离语义兼容性和标签频率偏差，有效提升了临床诊断的准确性

Abstract: Disease diagnosis is a central pillar of modern healthcare, enabling early
detection and timely intervention for acute conditions while guiding lifestyle
adjustments and medication regimens to prevent or slow chronic disease.
Self-reports preserve clinically salient signals that templated electronic
health record (EHR) documentation often attenuates or omits, especially subtle
but consequential details. To operationalize this shift, we introduce
MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset built from EHR discharge
notes and natively aligned to WHO ICD-11 terminology. We further present
LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that computes a
length-normalized joint likelihood of each label given the clinical report
context and subtracts the corresponding report-free prior likelihood for that
label. Across seven model backbones, LL-Rank consistently outperforms a strong
generation-plus-mapping baseline (GenMap). Ablation experiments show that
LL-Rank's gains primarily stem from its PMI-based scoring, which isolates
semantic compatibility from label frequency bias.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的成功激发了语言生成和学习的形式理论研究，需要理解在极限情况下语言生成的基本限制和可能性。

Method: 采用语言生成的极限框架，研究对手从未知语言中枚举字符串时算法的生成能力。通过部分枚举模型扩展经典框架，并重新审视Gold-Angluin语言识别模型。

Result: 证明了语言生成的最佳下界密度为1/2的紧界，在部分枚举设置下算法输出密度至少为α/2，其中α是揭示子集在语言中的下界密度。

Conclusion: 该研究为语言生成的极限理论提供了重要的理论边界，揭示了在部分信息设置下生成器性能的基本限制。

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) has motivated formal theories of
language generation and learning. We study the framework of \emph{language
generation in the limit}, where an adversary enumerates strings from an unknown
language $K$ drawn from a countable class, and an algorithm must generate
unseen strings from $K$. Prior work showed that generation is always possible,
and that some algorithms achieve positive lower density, revealing a
\emph{validity--breadth} trade-off between correctness and coverage. We resolve
a main open question in this line, proving a tight bound of $1/2$ on the best
achievable lower density. We then strengthen the model to allow \emph{partial
enumeration}, where the adversary reveals only an infinite subset $C \subseteq
K$. We show that generation in the limit remains achievable, and if $C$ has
lower density $\alpha$ in $K$, the algorithm's output achieves density at least
$\alpha/2$, matching the upper bound. This generalizes the $1/2$ bound to the
partial-information setting, where the generator must recover within a factor
$1/2$ of the revealed subset's density. We further revisit the classical
Gold--Angluin model of \emph{language identification} under partial
enumeration. We characterize when identification in the limit is possible --
when hypotheses $M_t$ eventually satisfy $C \subseteq M \subseteq K$ -- and in
the process give a new topological formulation of Angluin's characterization,
showing that her condition is precisely equivalent to an appropriate
topological space having the $T_D$ separation property.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) represents a rapidly expanding
digital infrastructure whose energy demand and associated CO2 emissions are
emerging as a new category of climate risk. This study introduces G-TRACE
(GenAI Transformative Carbon Estimator), a cross-modal, region-aware framework
that quantifies training- and inference-related emissions across modalities and
deployment geographies. Using real-world analytics and microscopic simulation,
G-TRACE measures energy use and carbon intensity per output type (text, image,
video) and reveals how decentralized inference amplifies small per-query energy
costs into system-level impacts. Through the Ghibli-style image generation
trend (2024-2025), we estimate 4,309 MWh of energy consumption and 2,068 tCO2
emissions, illustrating how viral participation inflates individual digital
actions into tonne-scale consequences. Building on these findings, we propose
the AI Sustainability Pyramid, a seven-level governance model linking carbon
accounting metrics (L1-L7) with operational readiness, optimization, and
stewardship. This framework translates quantitative emission metrics into
actionable policy guidance for sustainable AI deployment. The study contributes
to the quantitative assessment of emerging digital infrastructures as a novel
category of climate risk, supporting adaptive governance for sustainable
technology deployment. By situating GenAI within climate-risk frameworks, the
work advances data-driven methods for aligning technological innovation with
global decarbonization and resilience objectives.

Conclusion: SDS KoPub VDR为复杂真实世界文档智能中的多模态AI发展提供了基础资源和明确路线图。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for visual document retrieval (VDR) largely overlook
non-English languages and the structural complexity of official publications.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SDS KoPub VDR, the first
large-scale, publicly available benchmark for retrieving and understanding
Korean public documents. The benchmark is built upon a corpus of 361 real-world
documents (40,781 pages), including 256 files under the KOGL Type 1 license and
105 from official legal portals, capturing complex visual elements like tables,
charts, and multi-column layouts. To establish a challenging and reliable
evaluation set, we constructed 600 query-page-answer triples. These were
initially generated using multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) and subsequently
underwent a rigorous human verification and refinement process to ensure
factual accuracy and contextual relevance. The queries span six major public
domains and are systematically categorized by the reasoning modality required:
text-based, visual-based (e.g., chart interpretation), and cross-modal. We
evaluate SDS KoPub VDR on two complementary tasks that reflect distinct
retrieval paradigms: (1) text-only retrieval, which measures a model's ability
to locate relevant document pages based solely on textual signals, and (2)
multimodal retrieval, which assesses retrieval performance when visual features
(e.g., tables, charts, and layouts) are jointly leveraged alongside text. This
dual-task evaluation reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly in
multimodal scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning, even for state-of-the-art
models. As a foundational resource, SDS KoPub VDR not only enables rigorous and
fine-grained evaluation across textual and multimodal retrieval tasks but also
provides a clear roadmap for advancing multimodal AI in complex, real-world
document intelligence.

Abstract: Geotechnical reports are crucial for assessing the stability of rock
formations and ensuring safety in modern engineering. Traditionally, these
reports are prepared manually based on field observations using compasses,
magnifying glasses, and notebooks. This method is slow, prone to errors, and
subjective in its interpretations. To overcome these limitations, the use of
artificial intelligence techniques is proposed for the automatic generation of
reports through the processing of images and field data. The methodology was
based on the collection of photographs of rock outcrops and manual samples with
their respective descriptions, as well as on the reports prepared during the
Geotechnical Studies course. These resources were used to define the report
outline, prompt engineering, and validate the responses of a multimodal large
language model (MLLM). The iterative refinement of prompts until structured and
specific instructions were obtained for each section of the report proved to be
an effective alternative to the costly process of fine-tuning the MLLM. The
system evaluation establishes values of 0.455 and 0.653 for the BLEU and
ROUGE-L metrics, respectively, suggesting that automatic descriptions are
comparable to those made by experts. This tool, accessible via the web, with an
intuitive interface and the ability to export to standardized formats,
represents an innovation and an important contribution for professionals and
students of field geology.

Conclusion: 通过考虑用户角色差异和情感信息，SARC框架能更有效地检测假新闻，证明了角色聚类在假新闻检测中的重要性。

Abstract: Fake news detection has been a long-standing research focus in social
networks. Recent studies suggest that incorporating sentiment information from
both news content and user comments can enhance detection performance. However,
existing approaches typically treat sentiment features as auxiliary signals,
overlooking role differentiation, that is, the same sentiment polarity may
originate from users with distinct roles, thereby limiting their ability to
capture nuanced patterns for effective detection. To address this issue, we
propose SARC, a Sentiment-Augmented Role Clustering framework which utilizes
sentiment-enhanced deep clustering to identify user roles for improved fake
news detection. The framework first generates user features through joint
comment text representation (with BiGRU and Attention mechanism) and sentiment
encoding. It then constructs a differentiable deep clustering module to
automatically categorize user roles. Finally, unlike existing approaches which
take fake news label as the unique supervision signal, we propose a joint
optimization objective integrating role clustering and fake news detection to
further improve the model performance. Experimental results on two benchmark
datasets, RumourEval-19 and Weibo-comp, demonstrate that SARC achieves superior
performance across all metrics compared to baseline models. The code is

Result: 确认了Wikidata特定领域存在分类错误、过度泛化的子类链接和冗余连接问题。

Conclusion: 利用Wikidata的众包特性开发了有效的验证和检查系统，有助于改善知识图谱的质量。

Abstract: Wikidata is currently the largest open knowledge graph on the web,
encompassing over 120 million entities. It integrates data from various
domain-specific databases and imports a substantial amount of content from
Wikipedia, while also allowing users to freely edit its content. This openness
has positioned Wikidata as a central resource in knowledge graph research and
has enabled convenient knowledge access for users worldwide. However, its
relatively loose editorial policy has also led to a degree of taxonomic
inconsistency. Building on prior work, this study proposes and applies a novel
validation method to confirm the presence of classification errors,
over-generalized subclass links, and redundant connections in specific domains
of Wikidata. We further introduce a new evaluation criterion for determining
whether such issues warrant correction and develop a system that allows users
to inspect the taxonomic relationships of arbitrary Wikidata
entities-leveraging the platform's crowdsourced nature to its full potential.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel series of Russian information retrieval
datasets constructed from the "Did you know..." section of Russian Wikipedia.
Our datasets support a range of retrieval tasks, including fact-checking,
retrieval-augmented generation, and full-document retrieval, by leveraging
interesting facts and their referenced Wikipedia articles annotated at the
sentence level with graded relevance. We describe the methodology for dataset
creation that enables the expansion of existing Russian Information Retrieval
(IR) resources. Through extensive experiments, we extend the RusBEIR research
by comparing lexical retrieval models, such as BM25, with state-of-the-art
neural architectures fine-tuned for Russian, as well as multilingual models.
Results of our experiments show that lexical methods tend to outperform neural
models on full-document retrieval, while neural approaches better capture
lexical semantics in shorter texts, such as in fact-checking or fine-grained
retrieval. Using our newly created datasets, we also analyze the impact of
document length on retrieval performance and demonstrate that combining
retrieval with neural reranking consistently improves results. Our contribution
expands the resources available for Russian information retrieval research and
highlights the importance of accurate evaluation of retrieval models to achieve
optimal performance. All datasets are publicly available at HuggingFace. To
facilitate reproducibility and future research, we also release the full
implementation on GitHub.

Abstract: Historically, bilingualism was often perceived as an additional cognitive
load that could hinder linguistic and intellectual development. However, over
the last three decades, this view has changed considerably. Numerous studies
have aimed to model and understand the architecture of the bilingual word
recognition system Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), investigating how parallel
activation operates in the brain and how one language influences another Kroll
et al. (2015). Increasingly, evidence suggests that multilinguals, individuals
who speak three or more languages, can perform better than monolinguals in
various linguistic and cognitive tasks, such as learning an additional language
Abu-Rabia and Sanitsky (2010). This research proposal focuses on the study of
the mental lexicon and how it may be structured in individuals who speak
multiple languages. Building on the work of Stella et al. (2018), who
investigated explosive learning in humans using a multiplex model of the mental
lexicon, and the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework proposed by
Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), the present study applies the same multilayer
network principles introduced by Kivela et al. (2014). Our experimental design
extends previous research by incorporating multimodality into the multiplex
model, introducing an additional layer that connects visual inputs to their
corresponding lexical representations across the multilingual layers of the
mental lexicon. In this research, we aim to explore how a heritage language
influences the acquisition of another language. Specifically, we ask: Does the
presence of visual input in a translation task influence participants'
proficiency and accuracy compared to text-only conditions?

Result: 在具有真实关联标注的数据集上，aver在发现关联对方面表现优于tf-idf，特别是在图顶点关联发现任务中。

Conclusion: aver在某些特定应用场景（如图关联发现）中可能是比tf-idf更好的选择，尽管其计算复杂度更高且解释性更复杂。

Abstract: Prior to recent successes using neural networks, term frequency-inverse
document frequency (tf-idf) was clearly regarded as the best choice for
identifying documents related to a query. We provide a different score, aver,
and observe, on a dataset with ground truth marking for association, that aver
does do better at finding assciated pairs than tf-idf. This example involves
finding associated vertices in a large graph and that may be an area where
neural networks are not currently an obvious best choice. Beyond this one
anecdote, we observe that (1) aver has a natural threshold for declaring pairs
as unassociated while tf-idf does not, (2) aver can distinguish between pairs
of documents for which tf-idf gives a score of 1.0, (3) aver can be applied to
larger collections of documents than pairs while tf-idf cannot, and (4) that
aver is derived from entropy under a simple statistical model while tf-idf is a
construction designed to achieve a certain goal and hence aver may be more
"natural." To be fair, we also observe that (1) writing down and computing the
aver score for a pair is more complex than for tf-idf and (2) that the fact
that the aver score is naturally scale-free makes it more complicated to
interpret aver scores.

Motivation: 识别主流LVLM架构中存在的语言模态偏见问题，这种偏见主要源于将视觉嵌入简单附加到输入文本序列的常见做法，导致视觉信息被忽视。

Method: 提出简单有效的方法，通过整合平均池化的视觉特征来精炼文本嵌入，改善视觉信息的整合。

Result: 在已建立的基准测试中，该方法显著改善了视觉定位能力，并大幅减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 虽然平均池化提供了简单、鲁棒且高效的视觉信息整合方式，但更复杂的融合方法可能进一步改善视觉定位和跨模态对齐。

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established
benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and
efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

Motivation: 现有合成数据生成方法主要关注增加数据量，但往往导致语义多样性有限和描述冗余或肤浅，需要改进数据质量而非数量。

Method: 使用多视角角色扮演提示（如组合分析师、图像语境解释者）引导MLLMs从不同视角生成语义多样化的描述，增强图像-文本对齐的细粒度性。

Result: 仅用100万Role-SynthCLIP对训练的CLIP-B/16模型在MS COCO验证集上达到64.1%的Recall@1，比现有最佳合成数据基线（500万对训练）高出2.8个百分点。

Conclusion: Role-SynthCLIP通过提升合成数据的语义多样性而非数量，有效提高了CLIP模型的性能，证明了数据质量的重要性。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment

TL;DR: DeepEyesV2是一个代理式多模态模型，通过两阶段训练（冷启动+强化学习）实现稳健的工具调用能力，在RealX-Bench等基准测试中表现出色，能够根据任务自适应地调用工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建能够主动调用外部工具（如代码执行环境、网络搜索）并将这些操作整合到推理中的代理式多模态模型，以解决直接强化学习无法诱导稳健工具使用行为的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练管道：冷启动阶段建立工具使用模式，强化学习阶段进一步优化工具调用。构建多样化、适度挑战的训练数据集，专门包含工具使用有益的例子。

Result: 在RealX-Bench和其他代表性基准测试中，DeepEyesV2在真实世界理解、数学推理和搜索密集型任务上表现有效。模型展现出任务自适应的工具调用能力，倾向于对感知任务使用图像操作，对推理任务使用数值计算。

Conclusion: 两阶段训练方法能够有效构建代理式多模态模型，强化学习使模型能够进行复杂的工具组合并根据上下文选择性调用工具。该研究为开发代理式多模态模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but
also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and
web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we
introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from
the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation.
We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust
tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a
cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning
stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately
challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is
beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires
the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and
reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2
exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for
perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement
learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to
selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide
guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

TL;DR: PreResQ-R1是一个基于偏好-响应解耦强化学习的视觉质量评估框架，统一了绝对分数回归和相对排名一致性，在图像和视频质量评估任务上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中主要依赖监督微调或仅排名目标，导致推理浅层、分数校准差和跨领域泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出双分支奖励公式，分别建模样本内响应一致性和样本间偏好对齐，通过组相对策略优化进行优化，并设计了全局-时间局部-空间数据流策略用于视频质量评估。

Result: 在仅使用6K图像和28K视频进行强化学习微调后，在10个IQA和5个VQA基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，IQA任务中SRCC和PLCC指标分别提升了5.30%和2.15%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了定量性能提升，还产生了与人类对齐的推理轨迹，揭示了质量判断背后的感知线索。

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型空间感知能力不足的问题，避免使用额外专家编码器带来的开销和通用能力损害，开发更接近人类空间智能的AI系统。

Method: 构建VST-P空间感知数据集和VST-R空间推理数据集，采用渐进式训练流程：监督微调建立基础空间知识，强化学习提升空间推理能力。

Conclusion: VST框架显著增强了视觉语言动作模型的空间能力，为开发更物理接地的人工智能铺平了道路。

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench为多模态研究提供了一个可复现的评估框架，强调了文化多样性和多语言性的重要性，为构建更具包容性的多模态模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,

Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes

TL;DR: 提出了条件偏好优化(CPO)方法，通过直接优化控制条件而非生成图像来提升文本到图像生成的可控性，避免了DPO方法中图像质量等混杂因素的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet++只优化低噪声时间步，忽略了高噪声时间步的贡献；而DPO方法难以确保图像对只在可控性上存在差异。需要一种能消除混杂因素、在所有时间步优化可控性的方法。

Method: 构建获胜和失败的控制信号(c^w和c^l)，训练模型偏好c^w。通过直接优化控制条件而非生成图像，消除图像质量等混杂因素的影响。

Result: 在多个控制类型上显著优于ControlNet++：分割任务错误率降低超过10%，人体姿态任务降低70-80%，边缘和深度图任务一致降低2-5%。

Conclusion: CPO方法在理论上具有比DPO更低的对比损失方差，在实验中取得了优异结果，且需要更少的计算和存储资源。

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

Conclusion: 对抗样本对遮挡的敏感性可作为有效的检测特征，SWM-AED方法避免了传统对抗训练的灾难性过拟合问题。

Abstract: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean
samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial
attacks. This study first empirically finds that image-based adversarial
examples are notably sensitive to occlusion. Controlled experiments on CIFAR-10
used nine canonical attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to generate adversarial examples,
paired with original samples for evaluation. We introduce Sliding Mask
Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under
occlusion. Using 1800+ test images, SMCE calculations supported by Mask Entropy
Field Maps and statistical distributions show adversarial examples have
significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals.
Based on this, we propose Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example
Detection (SWM-AED), which avoids catastrophic overfitting of conventional
adversarial training. Evaluations across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10
demonstrate robust performance, with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to
96.5%.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and

model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R通过强化学习和完整性自验证机制有效解决了时间搜索中的监督不足问题，在多个基准测试中建立了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%

Abstract: Neural networks have become pervasive across various applications, including
security-related products. However, their widespread adoption has heightened
concerns regarding vulnerability to adversarial attacks. With emerging
regulations and standards emphasizing security, organizations must reliably
quantify risks associated with these attacks, particularly regarding
transferred adversarial attacks, which remain challenging to evaluate
accurately. This paper investigates the complexities involved in resilience
testing against transferred adversarial attacks. Our analysis specifically
addresses black-box evasion attacks, highlighting transfer-based attacks due to
their practical significance and typically high transferability between neural
network models. We underline the computational infeasibility of exhaustively
exploring high-dimensional input spaces to achieve complete test coverage. As a
result, comprehensive adversarial risk mapping is deemed impractical. To
mitigate this limitation, we propose a targeted resilience testing framework
that employs surrogate models strategically selected based on Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA) similarity. By leveraging surrogate models exhibiting both high
and low CKA similarities relative to the target model, the proposed approach
seeks to optimize coverage of adversarial subspaces. Risk estimation is
conducted using regression-based estimators, providing organizations with
realistic and actionable risk quantification.

Conclusion: DARN为关键地理空间应用中利用基础模型提供了更智能、鲁棒和高效的方法。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),

Abstract: This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach to cross-modal interaction for
tiny object detection by combining semantic-guided natural language processing
with advanced visual recognition backbones. The proposed method integrates the
BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature
Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), incorporating innovative backbone architectures
such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By
employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic
cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision
for small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and
Objects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance.
On the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP),
outperforming YOLO-World significantly while maintaining half the parameter
consumption of Transformer-based models like GLIP. Several test on different of
backbones such ELAN, MSP, and CSP further enable efficient handling of
multi-scale objects, ensuring scalability and robustness in
resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the potential of
integrating natural language understanding with advanced backbone
architectures, setting new benchmarks in object detection accuracy, efficiency,
and adaptability to real-world challenges.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and

Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for
training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality
assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that
compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel
knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape
artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage
framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a
specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle
gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based
anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography
datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets
respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully
concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with
AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study
involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the
method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human
readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the
most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least
anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human
rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable
agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This
method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows
developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and
pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a
synthetic dataset.

Motivation: 当前3D识别任务主要使用隐式表示（如PointNet），但在3D重建领域已有从隐式（如NeRF）向显式（如高斯溅射）表示转变的趋势。作者希望将这种优势引入3D识别任务，开发更高效的显式几何表示。

Conclusion: 3D高斯点编码器为3D识别任务提供了一种高效的显式几何表示替代方案，在计算效率和资源使用方面显著优于传统隐式方法。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component

Motivation: 当前通用生物医学图像分割模型存在两个关键挑战：训练数据冗余程度未知，以及跨域迁移对模型保留能力的影响。这些问题在生物医学图像分析中尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 1) 提出数据集量化(DQ)策略构建紧凑多样的训练子集；2) 使用MAE嵌入和t-SNE进行潜在空间分析；3) 进行跨域微调实验评估灾难性遗忘；4) 采用选择性DQ重放方法恢复源域性能。

Result: 1) 仅使用10%数据即可达到图像分割性能饱和；2) DQ选择比随机采样捕获更多特征多样性；3) 从通用域到专业域迁移时源域性能显著下降；4) 仅重放5-10%源数据即可有效恢复性能，而完全重放会阻碍目标域适应。

Conclusion: 生物医学图像分割需要以数据为中心的设计，高效训练不仅需要紧凑子集，还需要保留意识的学习策略和明智的域排序。数据集量化和选择性重放是解决数据冗余和灾难性遗忘的有效方法。

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available

Conclusion: NTP-MRISeg为传统MRIS流程提供了简化且有效的替代方案

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using
virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training
person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets
produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and
poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven
Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich
prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian
appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to
synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset
named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage,
we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn
domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning,
we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words
representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing
style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning
domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art
generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID
datasets.

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new

Conclusion: GroupKAN在保持高精度的同时显著降低了模型复杂度和参数量，为医学图像分割提供了更高效和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires models that are accurate, lightweight,
and interpretable. Convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and
transparent decision-making, whereas Transformer architectures are hindered by
quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addresses these
challenges using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving higher accuracy than
both convolutional and attention-based methods, fewer parameters than
Transformer variants, and improved interpretability compared to conventional
approaches. However, its O(C^2) complexity due to full-channel transformations
limits its scalability as the number of channels increases. To overcome this,
we introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two
novel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which
partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing
complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared
spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient, token-wise
nonlinearity. Evaluated on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC),
GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80 percent, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11
percent while requiring only 47.6 percent of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M),

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a cross-modal task that aims to retrieve
target images from large-scale databases using a reference image and a
modification text. Most existing methods rely on a single model to perform
feature fusion and similarity matching. However, this paradigm faces two major
challenges. First, one model alone can't see the whole picture and the tiny
details at the same time; it has to handle different tasks with the same
weights, so it often misses the small but important links between image and
text. Second, the absence of dynamic weight allocation prevents adaptive
leveraging of complementary model strengths, so the resulting embedding drifts
away from the target and misleads the nearest-neighbor search in CIR. To
address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (DAFM) for
multi-model collaboration in CIR. Rather than optimizing a single method in
isolation, DAFM exploits the complementary strengths of heterogeneous models
and adaptively rebalances their contributions. This not only maximizes
retrieval accuracy but also ensures that the performance gains are independent
of the fusion order, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Experiments
on the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements. Our
method achieves a Recall@10 of 93.21 and an Rmean of 84.43 on CIRR, and an
average Rmean of 67.48 on FashionIQ, surpassing recent strong baselines by up
to 4.5%. These results confirm that dynamic multi-model collaboration provides
an effective and general solution for CIR.

Result: 在单个RTX4090上成功渲染需要1亿个高斯分布的大型场景，达到最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: CLM系统有效解决了3DGS在大场景中的内存限制问题，使消费级GPU能够处理复杂3D渲染任务。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型控制方法（如ControlNet）依赖手工条件图和重训练、灵活性差的问题，以及基于反转的方法推理成本高的问题。

Method: 1. 单步注意力提取：从最优关键时间步提取注意力并重复使用；2. 潜在条件解耦(LCD)：分离关键时间步和噪声潜在表示；3. 支持组合控制：通过多源参考图像进行场景布局设计。

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5
percent additional cost.

Motivation: 当前主流的异常检测方法依赖于ImageNet预训练的特征网络，但ImageNet预训练过程与异常检测目标不匹配，且自然图像与工业图像存在分布偏移，导致预训练特征对AD任务不是最优的。

Method: 提出了角度和范数导向的对比损失函数，在大规模AD数据集RealIAD上进行预训练，基于类别通用化表示（残差特征）学习预训练AD表示。

Result: 在五个AD数据集和五个骨干网络上进行的广泛实验表明，使用该预训练特征的方法具有优越性。

Conclusion: 专门为异常检测任务设计的预训练表示能够显著提升AD性能，解决了ImageNet预训练与AD任务目标不匹配的问题。

Abstract: The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods
are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by
ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised
pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to
distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and
industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift.
The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD
tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained
representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this
end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed
for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for
industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies),
we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle
size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously.
To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our
pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further
alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD
datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the
class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on
five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with
our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and
five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features.

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a
favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,
demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and
pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is

facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of vision transformer models, specifically
Swin transformers, in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of ear diseases
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. With a reported 27%

accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the
Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de
Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle
and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and
Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and
Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,
marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed
metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a
critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this
study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the
data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies
were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This
finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning
studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while
vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance

Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for
over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their
GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in
isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions
inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural
Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without
conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical
decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial
deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive
spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial
patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash
risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates
a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate
and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in
safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a
17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers,
while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable
risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer
autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and
policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
(FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
(TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,

Relevance: 25.0

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个可微分框架，通过傅里叶级数参数化任意形状，研究深度神经网络对几何形状的理解能力，发现优化形状可作为语义载体、解释性工具和对抗攻击手段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络研究主要关注纹理特征，而对几何形状的理解能力缺乏系统研究。本文旨在探索DNNs如何感知和处理几何信息。

Method: 开发了端到端可微分框架：使用傅里叶级数参数化形状，基于环绕数的映射方法将形状转换为像素网格，并引入信号能量约束来确保物理合理的形状。

Result: 优化形状能够生成高置信度分类，精确隔离模型的显著区域，并构成新的可泛化对抗攻击范式。

Conclusion: 该框架为探索DNNs的几何世界提供了通用工具，为挑战和理解机器感知开辟了新前沿。

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
and understanding machine perception.

Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet
understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their
highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the
Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark
for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker
pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision
and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address
this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and
versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and
additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and
demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification
and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we
provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future
research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content
generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are

Motivation: 解决单目视频动态场景新视角合成的挑战，现有方法如NeRF和3DGS在动态内容和未知相机位姿方面存在局限。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 使用3D基础模型进行初始位姿和几何估计；2) 运动感知细化，包括MA-BA模块（结合transformer先验和SAM2分割）和MA-GS表示（使用控制点和变形场MLP）。

Result: 在真实动态数据集上实现1.8dB PSNR提升，在大型动态对象场景表现优异，计算需求减少5倍。

Conclusion: 4D3R框架在动态场景渲染中实现了高质量重建和计算效率的平衡，为无位姿动态神经渲染提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to
previous dynamic scene representations.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily

To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),

sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
techniques for TDA.

Abstract: Ultra-high-definition (UHD) images often suffer from severe degradations such
as blur, haze, rain, or low-light conditions, which pose significant challenges
for image restoration due to their high resolution and computational demands.
In this paper, we propose UHDRes, a novel lightweight dual-domain decoupled
spectral modulation framework for UHD image restoration. It explicitly models
the amplitude spectrum via lightweight spectrum-domain modulation, while
restoring phase implicitly through spatial-domain refinement. We introduce the
spatio-spectral fusion mechanism, which first employs a multi-scale context
aggregator to extract local and global spatial features, and then performs
spectral modulation in a decoupled manner. It explicitly enhances amplitude
features in the frequency domain while implicitly restoring phase information
through spatial refinement. Additionally, a shared gated feed-forward network
is designed to efficiently promote feature interaction through shared-parameter
convolutions and adaptive gating mechanisms. Extensive experimental comparisons
on five public UHD benchmarks demonstrate that our UHDRes achieves the
state-of-the-art restoration performance with only 400K parameters, while
significantly reducing inference latency and memory usage. The codes and models

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to

resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps

only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB
images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety
of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In
the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments
with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)
adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address
the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,
particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still
ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.
To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA
framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative
strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware
image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained
MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose
information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts
instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation
network, by removing static objects including background components. To further
boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction
methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.
Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with
varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,
PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable
performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is
more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based
approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using
such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on
segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In
this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence
streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which
use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network.
The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD
matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network
enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an
unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to
recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is
flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct
extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition
benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most
cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.

Method: 引入了xBD-S12数据集，包含10,315对Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2的灾前灾后图像对，与xBD基准时空对齐。通过一系列实验测试不同模型在中等分辨率下的损坏检测性能。

Result: 实验表明，在10米分辨率下，建筑物损坏在许多灾害场景中能够被较好地检测和绘制。复杂模型架构在泛化到未见过的灾害时表现不佳，地理空间基础模型带来的实际益处有限。

Conclusion: Copernicus图像是快速、广域损坏评估的可行数据源，可以与超高分辨率图像一起发挥重要作用。

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

Result: 多个人脸信息聚合能显著提升性能，特别是在包含多个可识别个体的图像中，该方法明显优于基于场景的基线方法。

Conclusion: 人脸信息是照片年代估计的有效线索，多个人脸信息聚合能提供更可靠的年代推断，特别是在包含多个可识别个体的场景中。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for
images containing several identifiable individuals.

Method: 使用模式感知双模态3D扩散框架进行跨模态学习，结合组织精炼网络和高效微结构精炼来保持结构保真度和细节。

Result: 在OASIS-3、ADNI和内部数据集上，fMRI合成PSNR/SSIM达29.83 dB/90.84%，dMRI合成达30.00 dB/77.55%，临床验证在NC vs. MCI vs. AD分类中达到67.92%准确率。

Conclusion: PDS方法在fMRI-dMRI跨模态合成中表现出色，合成的数据具有良好的诊断性能，为神经退行性疾病研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and
diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases.
However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use.
Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in
modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1)
significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and
dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related
neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we
propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D
diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement
network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain
structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house
datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores
of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and
30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation,
the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving

Motivation: 训练端到端的WSI表示模型面临重大挑战，因为标准千兆像素切片包含数万个图像块，由于当前GPU限制，难以在单个小批量中计算所有块的梯度。

Method: 使用内存库存储数据集中所有WSI的块特征。训练时，每个小批量包含多个WSI，随机采样部分块计算特征，同时从内存库中选择同一WSI的额外块特征，通过残差编码技术结合采样特征和检索特征生成WSI表示，最后基于小批量内WSI的表示和病理报告计算切片级对比损失。

Result: 在癌症亚型分类、癌症识别和突变预测任务上的实验证明了所提DRE-SLCL方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DRE-SLCL方法能够有效解决WSI表示训练中的计算挑战，并在多个癌症相关任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and

Abstract: During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can
significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the
risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and
computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is
critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In
this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical
smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model
and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability
of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is
designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly
integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their
accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces
only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the
original network architecture with minimal computational and modification
overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets
with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and
covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy,
and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM
commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively
enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or
weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and
generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏相机配置下实现了高质量的动态3D重建，无需密集掩码监督即可生成分割的动态重建结果。

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union

Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but
remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast,
noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision
and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.
  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used
to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two
variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped
regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference
(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated
into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.
  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume
model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =
0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic
segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective
intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with
clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.
  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net
provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The
method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for
hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing
manual workload and procedure time.

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances

Abstract: We present an AI-assisted Augmented Reality assembly workflow that uses deep
learning-based object recognition to identify different assembly components and
display step-by-step instructions. For each assembly step, the system displays
a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and
where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with
the real-time location of relevant components, the system eliminates the need
for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of different components before each
assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of using object recognition for
AR-assisted assembly, we highlight a case study involving the assembly of LEGO
sculptures.

Motivation: 细胞核分割是组织学图像分析的关键任务，但存在标注成本高、不同器官和组织采集过程差异大的挑战，需要开发能够泛化到未见器官或不同域的自监督方法。

Method: 提出LG-NuSegHop自监督管道，包含三个模块：(1)局部处理操作生成伪标签，(2)新颖的数据驱动特征提取模型NuSegHop，(3)全局操作后处理预测结果。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他自监督和弱监督方法，与全监督方法性能相当，且具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LG-NuSegHop提供了一种无需标注数据即可实现细胞核分割的有效方法，具有透明可解释性，适合临床应用。

Abstract: Nuclei segmentation is the cornerstone task in histology image reading,
shedding light on the underlying molecular patterns and leading to disease or
cancer diagnosis. Yet, it is a laborious task that requires expertise from
trained physicians. The large nuclei variability across different organ tissues
and acquisition processes challenges the automation of this task. On the other
hand, data annotations are expensive to obtain, and thus, Deep Learning (DL)
models are challenged to generalize to unseen organs or different domains. This
work proposes Local-to-Global NuSegHop (LG-NuSegHop), a self-supervised
pipeline developed on prior knowledge of the problem and molecular biology.
There are three distinct modules: (1) a set of local processing operations to
generate a pseudolabel, (2) NuSegHop a novel data-driven feature extraction
model and (3) a set of global operations to post-process the predictions of
NuSegHop. Notably, even though the proposed pipeline uses { no manually
annotated training data} or domain adaptation, it maintains a good
generalization performance on other datasets. Experiments in three publicly
available datasets show that our method outperforms other self-supervised and
weakly supervised methods while having a competitive standing among fully
supervised methods. Remarkably, every module within LG-NuSegHop is transparent
and explainable to physicians.

Conclusion: EETnet为嵌入式设备上的高效眼动追踪提供了可行解决方案，降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power
eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they
require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range.
However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs,
with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet,
a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely
event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited
resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and
quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions
of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid
superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the
pixel level.

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT为真实临床场景提供了灵活有效的多站点DW-MRI数据协调解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

Conclusion: CuisineSense为无干扰、基于可穿戴设备的饮食监测提供了一个实用解决方案，特别适合多样化的中国菜系。

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under

present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a

Conclusion: 神经形态传感器为实时流态监测提供了有效解决方案，事件数据模型在准确性和速度方面表现优异，支持实验控制和智能热管理的可靠实时反馈

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

Method: 研究了两种语言模型部署范式：反应式智能体（有限推理计算）和规划式智能体（扩展推理计算），并提出了AgileThinker方法同时使用两种推理范式。

Result: 实验表明即使最先进的模型在任一范式中都难以同时做出逻辑和及时的判断，而AgileThinker在任务难度和时间压力增加时始终优于单一范式智能体。

Conclusion: 实时推理是开发实用智能体的关键测试平台，为时间约束AI系统研究奠定了基础，指明了实现实时能力智能体的路径。

Abstract: Agents in the real world must make not only logical but also timely
judgments. This requires continuous awareness of the dynamic environment:
hazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act, while the agent's
reasoning is still unfolding. Despite advances in language model reasoning,
existing approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature. We introduce
real-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving
environments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two
paradigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which
employ language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses,
and (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex
problems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with
making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this
limitation, we propose AgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both
reasoning paradigms. AgileThinker consistently outperforms agents engaging only
one reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise,
effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency. Our work
establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for developing practical
agents and provides a foundation for research in temporally constrained AI
systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents.

Method: 提出NINJA方法，将有害用户目标置于特定位置后附加良性模型生成内容，利用目标位置对安全性的重要影响来实施越狱攻击。

Result: 在HarmBench基准测试中，NINJA显著提高了对LLaMA、Qwen、Mistral和Gemini等先进模型的攻击成功率，且具有低资源、可迁移和难以检测的特点。

Conclusion: 即使是良性的长上下文，当精心设计目标位置时，也会在现代语言模型中引入基本漏洞，这对模型安全性构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Recent advances in long-context language models (LMs) have enabled
million-token inputs, expanding their capabilities across complex tasks like
computer-use agents. Yet, the safety implications of these extended contexts
remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we introduce NINJA (short for
Needle-in-haystack jailbreak attack), a method that jailbreaks aligned LMs by
appending benign, model-generated content to harmful user goals. Critical to
our method is the observation that the position of harmful goals play an
important role in safety. Experiments on standard safety benchmark, HarmBench,
show that NINJA significantly increases attack success rates across
state-of-the-art open and proprietary models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
and Gemini. Unlike prior jailbreaking methods, our approach is low-resource,
transferable, and less detectable. Moreover, we show that NINJA is
compute-optimal -- under a fixed compute budget, increasing context length can
outperform increasing the number of trials in best-of-N jailbreak. These
findings reveal that even benign long contexts -- when crafted with careful
goal positioning -- introduce fundamental vulnerabilities in modern LMs.

Abstract: The emergence of Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) marks a paradigm shift in
the automotive industry, where software now plays a pivotal role in defining
vehicle functionality, enabling rapid innovation of modern vehicles. Developing
SDV-specific applications demands advanced tools to streamline code generation

domains. Still, restricted access to proprietary model architectures hinders
their adaption to specific tasks like SDV code generation. In this study, we
propose using prompts, a common and basic strategy to interact with LLMs and
redirect their responses. Using only system prompts with an appropriate and
efficient prompt structure designed using advanced prompt engineering
techniques, LLMs can be crafted without requiring a training session or access
to their base design. This research investigates the extensive experiments on
different models by applying various prompting techniques, including bare

generating SDV code. The results reveal that the model with a few-shot
prompting strategy outperforms the others in adjusting the LLM answers to match

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) utilizes external knowledge to augment
Large Language Models' (LLMs) reliability. For flexibility, agentic RAG employs
autonomous, multi-round retrieval and reasoning to resolve queries. Although
recent agentic RAG has improved via reinforcement learning, they often incur
substantial token overhead from search and reasoning processes. This trade-off
prioritizes accuracy over efficiency. To address this issue, this work proposes
TeaRAG, a token-efficient agentic RAG framework capable of compressing both
retrieval content and reasoning steps. 1) First, the retrieved content is
compressed by augmenting chunk-based semantic retrieval with a graph retrieval
using concise triplets. A knowledge association graph is then built from
semantic similarity and co-occurrence. Finally, Personalized PageRank is
leveraged to highlight key knowledge within this graph, reducing the number of
tokens per retrieval. 2) Besides, to reduce reasoning steps, Iterative
Process-aware Direct Preference Optimization (IP-DPO) is proposed.
Specifically, our reward function evaluates the knowledge sufficiency by a
knowledge matching mechanism, while penalizing excessive reasoning steps. This
design can produce high-quality preference-pair datasets, supporting iterative
DPO to improve reasoning conciseness. Across six datasets, TeaRAG improves the
average Exact Match by 4% and 2% while reducing output tokens by 61% and 59% on
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, respectively. Code is available at

TL;DR: DMA是一个在线学习框架，通过多粒度人类反馈动态调整RAG系统的检索排序，包含文档级、列表级和响应级信号，实现了实时适应而不牺牲基线能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统依赖静态检索，无法适应意图演变和内容漂移，需要动态调整机制来提升交互性能。

Method: DMA采用多粒度反馈学习流水线：监督训练点对和列表排序器、基于响应偏好的策略优化、知识蒸馏到轻量级评分器。

Result: 在线部署显示人类参与度显著提升，离线测试在TriviaQA和HotpotQA等对话QA任务上获得显著收益，同时保持基础检索竞争力。

Conclusion: DMA为RAG系统提供了基于反馈的实时适应原则性方法，无需牺牲基线能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often rely on static retrieval,
limiting adaptation to evolving intent and content drift. We introduce Dynamic
Memory Alignment (DMA), an online learning framework that systematically
incorporates multi-granularity human feedback to align ranking in interactive
settings. DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level signals into a
coherent learning pipeline: supervised training for pointwise and listwise
rankers, policy optimization driven by response-level preferences, and
knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving.
Throughout this paper, memory refers to the model's working memory, which is
the entire context visible to the LLM for In-Context Learning.
  We adopt a dual-track evaluation protocol mirroring deployment: (i)
large-scale online A/B ablations to isolate the utility of each feedback
source, and (ii) few-shot offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks.
Online, a multi-month industrial deployment further shows substantial
improvements in human engagement. Offline, DMA preserves competitive
foundational retrieval while yielding notable gains on conversational QA
(TriviaQA, HotpotQA). Taken together, these results position DMA as a
principled approach to feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG without
sacrificing baseline capability.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨ChatGPT如何推断用户的政治观点并据此调整回答，发现回应会与推断的政治立场保持一致，即使使用自定义指令和记忆功能也会出现类似的政治推断。


<details>

Motivation: 研究LLMs在推断用户人口统计信息（特别是政治观点）时可能引发的伦理问题，如偏见、隐性个性化以及回音室效应，旨在了解政治观点推断如何影响ChatGPT的全球回应。

Method: 创建三个角色（两个政治导向，一个中立），每个角色有四个反映其观点的陈述，通过记忆和自定义指令将这些观点传达给ChatGPT，然后提出八个问题进行定性分析。

Result: ChatGPT的回应与推断的政治观点保持一致，显示不同的推理和词汇使用，即使讨论相似话题。自定义指令和记忆功能在政治推断方面表现相似，且ChatGPT的输出倾向于左倾。

Conclusion: LLMs会基于推断的用户政治观点调整回应，这可能加剧偏见和回音室效应，需要关注此类系统的伦理设计和透明度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) distinguish themselves by quickly delivering
information and providing personalized responses through natural language
prompts. However, they also infer user demographics, which can raise ethical
concerns about bias and implicit personalization and create an echo chamber
effect. This study aims to explore how inferred political views impact the
responses of ChatGPT globally, regardless of the chat session. We also
investigate how custom instruction and memory features alter responses in
ChatGPT, considering the influence of political orientation. We developed three
personas (two politically oriented and one neutral), each with four statements
reflecting their viewpoints on DEI programs, abortion, gun rights, and
vaccination. We convey the personas' remarks to ChatGPT using memory and custom
instructions, allowing it to infer their political perspectives without
directly stating them. We then ask eight questions to reveal differences in
worldview among the personas and conduct a qualitative analysis of the
responses. Our findings indicate that responses are aligned with the inferred
political views of the personas, showing varied reasoning and vocabulary, even
when discussing similar topics. We also find the inference happening with
explicit custom instructions and the implicit memory feature in similar ways.
Analyzing response similarities reveals that the closest matches occur between
the democratic persona with custom instruction and the neutral persona,
supporting the observation that ChatGPT's outputs lean left.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在文本分类中表现出色，但在安全系统中部署时需要评估其可靠性，而不仅仅是基准性能。现有评估方法缺乏对模型可信度的系统评估。

Method: 提出TCF框架，包含三个可信度维度：校准度（预测置信度与准确度的匹配）、一致性（不同输入变体的输出稳定性）、鲁棒性（对抗攻击的抵抗力）。通过TCI指数和CDS指标量化评估。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，GPT-4具有最强的整体可信度，其次是LLaMA-3-8B和DeBERTa-v3-base。统计分析证实可靠性与原始准确度独立变化。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM钓鱼检测提供了透明可复现的可信度评估基础，强调了现实部署中可信度评估的重要性。

Abstract: Phishing emails continue to pose a persistent challenge to online
communication, exploiting human trust and evading automated filters through
realistic language and adaptive tactics. While large language models (LLMs)
such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-3-8B achieve strong accuracy in text classification,
their deployment in security systems requires assessing reliability beyond
benchmark performance. To address this, this study introduces the
Trustworthiness Calibration Framework (TCF), a reproducible methodology for
evaluating phishing detectors across three dimensions: calibration,
consistency, and robustness. These components are integrated into a bounded
index, the Trustworthiness Calibration Index (TCI), and complemented by the
Cross-Dataset Stability (CDS) metric that quantifies stability of
trustworthiness across datasets. Experiments conducted on five corpora, such as
SecureMail 2025, Phishing Validation 2024, CSDMC2010, Enron-Spam, and Nazario,
using DeBERTa-v3-base, LLaMA-3-8B, and GPT-4 demonstrate that GPT-4 achieves
the strongest overall trust profile, followed by LLaMA-3-8B and
DeBERTa-v3-base. Statistical analysis confirms that reliability varies
independently of raw accuracy, underscoring the importance of trust-aware
evaluation for real-world deployment. The proposed framework establishes a
transparent and reproducible foundation for assessing model dependability in
LLM-based phishing detection.

potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically,
we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training
well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors
such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We
evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise.
Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks

Conclusion: 该框架表明AI智能体可以通过系统探索解空间、验证法规合规性和透明权衡来增强人类规划者，不是替代人类判断而是用计算推理能力增强它。

Abstract: AI has proven highly successful at urban planning analysis -- learning
patterns from data to predict future conditions. The next frontier is
AI-assisted decision-making: agents that recommend sites, allocate resources,
and evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and
stakeholder values. Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting,
ReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision
achievable.
  This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for
reasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers
(Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis,
Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a
multi-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions
require explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying
normative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction),
and explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that
statistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with
statistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark
evaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges. This framework
shows how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring
solution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over
trade-offs transparently -- not replacing human judgment but amplifying it with
computational reasoning capabilities.

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验证明SWAP具有有效性、无害性，并能抵抗潜在的自适应攻击。

Conclusion: SWAP通过在不同决策空间中嵌入水印，成功解决了软提示版权保护的挑战，为模型版权保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models, especially CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable performance across diverse downstream tasks. Soft prompts, as
carefully crafted modules that efficiently adapt vision-language models to
specific tasks, necessitate effective copyright protection. In this paper, we
investigate model copyright protection by auditing whether suspicious
third-party models incorporate protected soft prompts. While this can be viewed
as a special case of model ownership auditing, our analysis shows that existing
techniques are ineffective due to prompt learning's unique characteristics.
Non-intrusive auditing is inherently prone to false positives when independent
models share similar data distributions with victim models. Intrusive
approaches also fail: backdoor methods designed for CLIP cannot embed
functional triggers, while extending traditional DNN backdoor techniques to
prompt learning suffers from harmfulness and ambiguity challenges. We find that
these failures in intrusive auditing stem from the same fundamental reason:
watermarking operates within the same decision space as the primary task yet
pursues opposing objectives. Motivated by these findings, we propose sequential
watermarking for soft prompts (SWAP), which implants watermarks into a
different and more complex space. SWAP encodes watermarks through a specific
order of defender-specified out-of-distribution classes, inspired by the
zero-shot prediction capability of CLIP. This watermark, which is embedded in a
more complex space, keeps the original prediction label unchanged, making it
less opposed to the primary task. We further design a hypothesis-test-guided
verification protocol for SWAP and provide theoretical analyses of success
conditions. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate SWAP's
effectiveness, harmlessness, and robustness against potential adaptive attacks.

Motivation: 传统模仿学习方法通常只学习从观察到动作的直接映射，忽略了不同模态（感官输入、动作、奖励）之间的丰富交互，而这些交互对于建模机器人行为和理解任务结果至关重要。

Method: MDF应用随机部分掩码并训练扩散模型来重建轨迹，这种训练目标鼓励模型学习时间和跨模态依赖关系，如预测动作对力信号的影响或从部分观测推断状态。

Result: 在模拟和真实环境的接触丰富、强力操作任务中评估MDF，结果显示MDF不仅提供多功能性，还实现了强性能和噪声观测下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MDF是一个统一的多模态机器人轨迹学习框架，通过扩散模型有效学习跨模态依赖，在复杂操作任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Given a dataset of expert trajectories, standard imitation learning
approaches typically learn a direct mapping from observations (e.g., RGB
images) to actions. However, such methods often overlook the rich interplay
between different modalities, i.e., sensory inputs, actions, and rewards, which
is crucial for modeling robot behavior and understanding task outcomes. In this
work, we propose Multimodal Diffusion Forcing, a unified framework for learning
from multimodal robot trajectories that extends beyond action generation.
Rather than modeling a fixed distribution, MDF applies random partial masking
and trains a diffusion model to reconstruct the trajectory. This training
objective encourages the model to learn temporal and cross-modal dependencies,
such as predicting the effects of actions on force signals or inferring states
from partial observations. We evaluate MDF on contact-rich, forceful
manipulation tasks in simulated and real-world environments. Our results show
that MDF not only delivers versatile functionalities, but also achieves strong
performance, and robustness under noisy observations. More visualizations can

Abstract: Software Architecture Descriptions (SADs) are essential for managing the
inherent complexity of modern software systems. They enable high-level
architectural reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate effective
communication among diverse stakeholders. However, in practice, SADs are often
missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system's actual implementation.
Consequently, developers are compelled to derive architectural insights
directly from source code-a time-intensive process that increases cognitive
load, slows new developer onboarding, and contributes to the gradual
degradation of clarity over the system's lifetime. To address these issues, we
propose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating
reverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our
approach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting
a comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant
elements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine
diagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with
few-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and
maintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation.
This methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent
capability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the
reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex
software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge
through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward
significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and
long-term maintainability.

system for HRP classification that pairs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
with human oversight to produce policy-based outputs that can be audited. Small
cooperating agents, retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, and
feedback logger, coordinate via agent-to-agent messaging and invoke tools
through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-agnostic on-premise
operation. The interface follows an Item to Evidence to Decision loop with
step-by-step reasoning, on-policy citations, and append-only audit bundles
(run-cards, prompts, evidence). In preliminary tests on real HRP cases, ORCHID
improves accuracy and traceability over a non-agentic baseline while deferring
uncertain items to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The demonstration shows
single item submission, grounded citations, SME feedback capture, and
exportable audit artifacts, illustrating a practical path to trustworthy LLM

Abstract: This research-to-practice full paper was inspired by the persistent challenge
in effective communication among engineering students. Public speaking is a
necessary skill for future engineers as they have to communicate technical
knowledge with diverse stakeholders. While universities offer courses or
workshops, they are unable to offer sustained and personalized training to
students. Providing comprehensive feedback on both verbal and non-verbal
aspects of public speaking is time-intensive, making consistent and
individualized assessment impractical. This study integrates research on verbal
and non-verbal cues in public speaking to develop an AI-driven assessment model
for engineering students. Our approach combines speech analysis, computer
vision, and sentiment detection into a multi-modal AI system that provides
assessment and feedback. The model evaluates (1) verbal communication (pitch,
loudness, pacing, intonation), (2) non-verbal communication (facial
expressions, gestures, posture), and (3) expressive coherence, a novel
integration ensuring alignment between speech and body language. Unlike
previous systems that assess these aspects separately, our model fuses multiple
modalities to deliver personalized, scalable feedback. Preliminary testing
demonstrated that our AI-generated feedback was moderately aligned with expert
evaluations. Among the state-of-the-art AI models evaluated, all of which were
Large Language Models (LLMs), including Gemini and OpenAI models, Gemini Pro
emerged as the best-performing, showing the strongest agreement with human
annotators. By eliminating reliance on human evaluators, this AI-driven public
speaking trainer enables repeated practice, helping students naturally align
their speech with body language and emotion, crucial for impactful and
professional communication.

Result: 作为应用AI素养的衡量标准，竞赛中的场景任务表现优于从过去研究采用或自行开发的测试，表明情境化实践技能评估更有效。

Conclusion: 在为AI相关工作培训人员时，特别是为非技术背景的工人准备AI集成角色时，应使用强调高度情境化实践技能而非抽象技术知识的评估工具。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become ubiquitous in professional
contexts, there is an urgent need to equip workers, often with backgrounds
outside of STEM, with the skills to use these tools effectively as well as
responsibly, that is, to be AI literate. However, prevailing definitions and
therefore assessments of AI literacy often emphasize foundational technical
knowledge, such as programming, mathematics, and statistics, over practical
knowledge such as interpreting model outputs, selecting tools, or identifying
ethical concerns. This leaves a noticeable gap in assessing someone's AI
literacy for real-world job use. We propose a work-task-oriented assessment
model for AI literacy which is grounded in the competencies required for
effective use of AI tools in professional settings. We describe the development
of a novel AI literacy assessment instrument, and accompanying formative
assessments, in the context of a US Navy robotics training program. The program
included training in robotics and AI literacy, as well as a competition with
practical tasks and a multiple choice scenario task meant to simulate use of AI
in a job setting. We found that, as a measure of applied AI literacy, the
competition's scenario task outperformed the tests we adopted from past
research or developed ourselves. We argue that when training people for
AI-related work, educators should consider evaluating them with instruments
that emphasize highly contextualized practical skills rather than abstract
technical knowledge, especially when preparing workers without technical
backgrounds for AI-integrated roles.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于贝叶斯学习的拒绝选项预测器，在认知不确定性高的区域拒绝预测，通过最小化期望遗憾来优化决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拒绝选项方法只关注偶然不确定性，但在数据有限的实际场景中，认知不确定性不可忽视。需要一种能够识别训练数据不足区域的预测框架。

Method: 基于贝叶斯学习，重新定义最优预测器为最小化期望遗憾的预测器，当输入导致的遗憾超过指定拒绝成本时拒绝预测。

Result: 提出了第一个原则性框架，能够学习识别训练数据不足以做出可靠决策的输入。

Conclusion: 该方法为高风险应用中的不确定性量化提供了理论基础，特别是在数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: In high-stakes applications, predictive models must not only produce accurate
predictions but also quantify and communicate their uncertainty. Reject-option
prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction
uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on
aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes
the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios,
limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the
epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic
uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we
redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the
performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with
full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for
a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the
first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of
identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable
decisions.

Abstract: We explore whether neural networks can decode brain activity into speech by
mapping EEG recordings to audio representations. Using EEG data recorded as

Motivation: 认知诊断模型在现代智能教育平台中广泛使用，但训练数据包含敏感的学生信息。虽然成员推理攻击在其他领域已有研究，但在CDM领域的隐私风险尚未量化，存在重要研究空白。

Method: 提出新颖的灰盒威胁模型，利用教育平台中通过雷达图等可视化暴露的内部知识状态向量；开发P-MIA框架，结合模型最终预测概率和暴露的内部状态向量作为特征。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上对主流CDM进行广泛实验，证明灰盒攻击显著优于标准黑盒基线；成功将P-MIA用作审计工具评估机器遗忘技术的有效性并揭示其局限性。

Conclusion: CDM面临严重的隐私风险，暴露的内部知识状态向量为攻击者提供了强大的攻击面；P-MIA框架可作为有效的隐私风险评估工具。

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) are pivotal for creating fine-grained
learner profiles in modern intelligent education platforms. However, these
models are trained on sensitive student data, raising significant privacy
concerns. While membership inference attacks (MIA) have been studied in various
domains, their application to CDMs remains a critical research gap, leaving
their privacy risks unquantified. This paper is the first to systematically
investigate MIA against CDMs. We introduce a novel and realistic grey box
threat model that exploits the explainability features of these platforms,
where a model's internal knowledge state vectors are exposed to users through
visualizations such as radar charts. We demonstrate that these vectors can be
accurately reverse-engineered from such visualizations, creating a potent
attack surface. Based on this threat model, we propose a profile-based MIA
(P-MIA) framework that leverages both the model's final prediction
probabilities and the exposed internal knowledge state vectors as features.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets against mainstream CDMs show
that our grey-box attack significantly outperforms standard black-box
baselines. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of P-MIA as an auditing tool by
successfully evaluating the efficacy of machine unlearning techniques and
revealing their limitations.

TL;DR: ScheduleStream是首个用于规划与调度的通用框架，通过混合持续动作建模时间动态，支持双臂机器人异步并行运动规划，解决了传统TAMP算法只能顺序执行动作的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统任务与运动规划(TAMP)算法在双臂和人形机器人控制中存在局限性，通常只能规划顺序执行的动作，无法充分利用双臂并行运动的效率优势。由于混合离散-连续动作空间的复杂性，同时控制多个臂在计算上具有挑战性。

Method: 提出ScheduleStream框架，使用混合持续动作建模时间动态，支持异步启动和参数化持续时间。开发领域无关算法解决ScheduleStream问题，在TAMPAS中利用GPU加速采样器加速规划过程。

Result: 在仿真实验中，ScheduleStream算法相比多个消融实验产生了更高效的解决方案。在真实世界双臂机器人任务中成功演示了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: ScheduleStream成功扩展了TAMP以产生调度计划，实现了双臂机器人的并行运动规划，提高了任务执行效率。

Abstract: Bimanual and humanoid robots are appealing because of their human-like
ability to leverage multiple arms to efficiently complete tasks. However,
controlling multiple arms at once is computationally challenging due to the
growth in the hybrid discrete-continuous action space. Task and Motion Planning
(TAMP) algorithms can efficiently plan in hybrid spaces but generally produce
plans, where only one arm is moving at a time, rather than schedules that allow
for parallel arm motion. In order to extend TAMP to produce schedules, we
present ScheduleStream, the first general-purpose framework for planning &
scheduling with sampling operations. ScheduleStream models temporal dynamics
using hybrid durative actions, which can be started asynchronously and persist
for a duration that's a function of their parameters. We propose
domain-independent algorithms that solve ScheduleStream problems without any
application-specific mechanisms. We apply ScheduleStream to Task and Motion
Planning & Scheduling (TAMPAS), where we use GPU acceleration within samplers
to expedite planning. We compare ScheduleStream algorithms to several ablations
in simulation and find that they produce more efficient solutions. We
demonstrate ScheduleStream on several real-world bimanual robot tasks at

Motivation: 当前检索系统混淆了寻找相关信息与提供足够推理上下文这两个独立过程，需要更符合人类信息处理方式的架构。

Method: 采用双层次架构：细粒度搜索表示用于精确语义匹配，粗粒度检索上下文用于完整推理，两者直接连接且不增加额外处理成本。

Result: SINR框架将检索从被动步骤转变为主动过程，提高了检索系统的性能和质量。

Conclusion: SINR为下一代使用检索的AI系统提供了实用基础，改变了传统检索系统的设计范式。

Abstract: Retrieval systems are essential to contemporary AI pipelines, although most
confuse two separate processes: finding relevant information and giving enough
context for reasoning. We introduce the Search-Is-Not-Retrieve (SINR)
framework, a dual-layer architecture that distinguishes between fine-grained
search representations and coarse-grained retrieval contexts. SINR enhances the
composability, scalability, and context fidelity of retrieval systems by
directly connecting small, semantically accurate search chunks to larger,
contextually complete retrieve chunks, all without incurring extra processing
costs. This design changes retrieval from a passive step to an active one,
making the system architecture more like how people process information. We
discuss the SINR framework's conceptual foundation, formal structure,
implementation issues, and qualitative outcomes. This provides a practical
foundation for the next generation of AI systems that use retrieval.

Motivation: 内存计算(IMC)通过减少数据移动瓶颈和利用内存计算的固有并行性，为深度学习加速带来了范式转变。在基于IMC的硬件上高效部署CNN需要先进的任务分配策略以实现最大计算效率。

Method: 使用具有多个处理单元(PUs)的IMC仿真器(IMCE)，提出LBLP算法动态分配CNN节点到可用PUs，通过优化资源利用来最大化处理速率和最小化延迟。

Result: 实验结果表明，LBLP算法在多个CNN模型上相比其他调度策略表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: LBLP算法能有效优化CNN在IMC多处理系统中的部署，显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: In-Memory Computing (IMC) represents a paradigm shift in deep learning
acceleration by mitigating data movement bottlenecks and leveraging the
inherent parallelism of memory-based computations. The efficient deployment of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on IMC-based hardware necessitates the use
of advanced task allocation strategies for achieving maximum computational
efficiency. In this work, we exploit an IMC Emulator (IMCE) with multiple
Processing Units (PUs) for investigating how the deployment of a CNN model in a
multi-processing system affects its performance, in terms of processing rate
and latency. For that purpose, we introduce the Load-Balance-Longest-Path
(LBLP) algorithm, that dynamically assigns all CNN nodes to the available IMCE
PUs, for maximizing the processing rate and minimizing latency due to efficient
resources utilization. We are benchmarking LBLP against other alternative
scheduling strategies for a number of CNN models and experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: MDM是一种后训练DNN权重映射技术，通过优化有源忆阻器位置来减少寄生电阻非理想性，在ImageNet-1k上可将非理想因子降低46%，ResNet准确率平均提升3.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寄生电阻限制了忆阻器存内计算交叉阵列的效率，需要将DNN矩阵映射到小尺寸瓦片中，这会增加数字同步、延迟、I/O压力和芯片面积。

Method: 利用比特级结构化稀疏性，从密度较高的低阶侧输入激活，并根据曼哈顿距离重新排列行，将有源单元重新定位到受寄生电阻影响较小的区域。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k上，MDM将非理想因子降低高达46%，在模拟失真下ResNet准确率平均提高3.6%。

Conclusion: MDM提供了一种轻量级、空间感知的方法来扩展存内计算DNN加速器。

Abstract: Manhattan Distance Mapping (MDM) is a post-training deep neural network (DNN)
weight mapping technique for memristive bit-sliced compute-in-memory (CIM)
crossbars that reduces parasitic resistance (PR) nonidealities.
  PR limits crossbar efficiency by mapping DNN matrices into small crossbar
tiles, reducing CIM-based speedup. Each crossbar executes one tile, requiring
digital synchronization before the next layer. At this granularity, designers
either deploy many small crossbars in parallel or reuse a few sequentially-both
increasing analog-to-digital conversions, latency, I/O pressure, and chip area.
  MDM alleviates PR effects by optimizing active-memristor placement.
Exploiting bit-level structured sparsity, it feeds activations from the denser
low-order side and reorders rows according to the Manhattan distance,
relocating active cells toward regions less affected by PR and thus lowering
the nonideality factor (NF).
  Applied to DNN models on ImageNet-1k, MDM reduces NF by up to 46% and
improves accuracy under analog distortion by an average of 3.6% in ResNets.
Overall, it provides a lightweight, spatially informed method for scaling CIM
DNN accelerators.

Abstract: We argue that training autoencoders to reconstruct inputs from noised

encodings that are structured according to a perceptual hierarchy. We
demonstrate the emergence of this hierarchical structure by showing that, after
training an audio autoencoder in this manner, perceptually salient information
is captured in coarser representation structures than with conventional
training. Furthermore, we show that such perceptual hierarchies improve latent
diffusion decoding in the context of estimating surprisal in music pitches and
predicting EEG-brain responses to music listening. Pretrained weights are

Abstract: The proliferation of distorted, compressed, and manipulated music on modern

fingerprinting techniques to identify the sources of musical recordings. In
this paper, we develop and evaluate new neural audio fingerprinting techniques

fingerprinting methodology: (1) we use a pretrained music foundation model as
the backbone of the neural architecture and (2) we expand the use of data
augmentation to train fingerprinting models under a wide variety of audio
manipulations, including time streching, pitch modulation, compression, and
filtering. We systematically evaluate our methods in comparison to two
state-of-the-art neural fingerprinting models: NAFP and GraFPrint. Results show
that fingerprints extracted with music foundation models (e.g., MuQ, MERT)
consistently outperform models trained from scratch or pretrained on
non-musical audio. Segment-level evaluation further reveals their capability to
accurately localize fingerprint matches, an important practical feature for
catalog management.

Abstract: This research category full paper investigates how community college
instructors evaluate interactive, no-code AI literacy resources designed for
non-STEM learners. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated
into everyday technologies, AI literacy - the ability to evaluate AI systems,
communicate with them, and understand their broader impacts - has emerged as a
critical skill across disciplines. Yet effective, scalable approaches for
teaching these concepts in higher education remain limited, particularly for
students outside STEM fields.
  To address this gap, we developed AI User, an interactive online curriculum

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络高能耗问题，利用脑启发的超维计算作为轻量级替代方案，但HDC在复杂视觉任务上精度较低，需要与CNN结合。RISC-V架构为领域特定GPU设计提供了新的机会。

Method: 设计并实现了针对HDC操作优化的定制GPU指令，在RISC-V GPU平台上支持混合HDC-CNN工作负载的高效处理。

Result: 使用四种定制HDC指令的实验结果显示，在微基准测试中性能提升最高达56.2倍。

Conclusion: RISC-V GPU在能效高性能计算方面具有巨大潜力，特别适合定制计算模型如HDC。

Abstract: Machine learning based on neural networks has advanced rapidly, but the high
energy consumption required for training and inference remains a major
challenge. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight,
brain-inspired alternative that enables high parallelism but often suffers from
lower accuracy on complex visual tasks. To overcome this, hybrid accelerators
combining HDC and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed,
though their adoption is limited by poor generalizability and programmability.
The rise of open-source RISC-V architectures has created new opportunities for
domain-specific GPU design. Unlike traditional proprietary GPUs, emerging
RISC-V-based GPUs provide flexible, programmable platforms suitable for custom
computation models such as HDC. In this study, we design and implement custom
GPU instructions optimized for HDC operations, enabling efficient processing
for hybrid HDC-CNN workloads. Experimental results using four types of custom
HDC instructions show a performance improvement of up to 56.2 times in
microbenchmark tests, demonstrating the potential of RISC-V GPUs for
energy-efficient, high-performance computing.

Motivation: 探索量子计算在全局优化问题中的潜力，特别是研究量子特性（叠加和纠缠）如何增强传统遗传算法的性能。

Method: 使用量子电路表示个体，通过测量结果解码为实值向量。引入固定深度和可变深度变体，比较有无Hadamard门的门集，并研究个体间纠缠对收敛的影响。

Result: 叠加一致提高了在Rastrigin等基准函数上的收敛性和鲁棒性。个体间纠缠加速了早期收敛，表明量子相关性提供了额外的优化优势。

Conclusion: 叠加和纠缠都能增强量子进化算法的搜索动态，基于门的QGA是量子增强全局优化的有前景框架。

Abstract: We propose a gate-based Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) for real-valued
global optimization. In this model, individuals are represented by quantum
circuits whose measurement outcomes are decoded into real-valued vectors
through binary discretization. Evolutionary operators act directly on circuit
structures, allowing mutation and crossover to explore the space of gate-based
encodings. Both fixed-depth and variable-depth variants are introduced,
enabling either uniform circuit complexity or adaptive structural evolution.
Fitness is evaluated through quantum sampling, using the mean decoded output of
measurement outcomes as the argument of the objective function. To isolate the
impact of quantum resources, we compare gate sets with and without the Hadamard
gate, showing that superposition consistently improves convergence and
robustness across benchmark functions such as the Rastrigin function.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that introducing pairwise inter-individual
entanglement in the population accelerates early convergence, revealing that
quantum correlations among individuals provide an additional optimization
advantage. Together, these results show that both superposition and
entanglement enhance the search dynamics of evolutionary quantum algorithms,
establishing gate-based QGAs as a promising framework for quantum-enhanced
global optimization.

Result: 在相同数据集上达到96.16%的准确率，比现有方法至少提高4.78%，在区分易混淆动作方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: PECL网络通过多域信号处理和时间依赖建模，显著提高了雷达医疗监测的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持适度的模型复杂度。

Abstract: Radar systems are increasingly favored for medical applications because they
provide non-intrusive monitoring with high privacy and robustness to lighting
conditions. However, existing research typically relies on single-domain radar
signals and overlooks the temporal dependencies inherent in human activity,
which complicates the classification of similar actions. To address this issue,
we designed the Parallel-EfficientNet-CBAM-LSTM (PECL) network to process data
in three complementary domains: Range-Time, Doppler-Time, and Range-Doppler.
PECL combines a channel-spatial attention module and temporal units to capture
more features and dynamic dependencies during action sequences, improving both
accuracy and robustness. The experimental results show that PECL achieves an
accuracy of 96.16% on the same dataset, outperforming existing methods by at
least 4.78%. PECL also performs best in distinguishing between easily confused
actions. Despite its strong performance, PECL maintains moderate model
complexity, with 23.42M parameters and 1324.82M FLOPs. Its parameter-efficient
design further reduces computational cost.

thousands of individual action alternatives, followed by evaluations aimed at
identifying alternative courses of action with superior outcomes. These
alternatives are appraised in light of the opponent's status and actions,
considering unit composition, force ratios, types of offense and defense, and
anticipated advance rates. Field manuals evaluate battle outcomes and
advancement rates. The processes of generation and evaluation work
concurrently, yielding a variety of alternative courses of action. This

Abstract: With more and more existing networks being transformed to Software-Defined
Networking (SDN), they need to be more secure and demand smarter ways of
traffic control. This work, SmartSecChain-SDN, is a platform that combines
machine learning based intrusion detection, blockchain-based storage of logs,
and application-awareness-based priority in SDN networks. To detect network
intrusions in a real-time, precision and low-false positives setup, the
framework utilizes the application of advanced machine learning algorithms,
namely Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and CNN-BiLSTM. SmartSecChain-SDN is
based on the Hyperledger Fabric, which is a permissioned blockchain technology,
to provide secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving storage and, thus,
guarantee that the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) records cannot be altered
and can be analyzed comprehensively. The system also has Quality of Service
(QoS) rules and traffic shaping based on applications, which enables
prioritization of critical services, such as VoIP, video conferencing, and
business applications, as well as de-prioritization of non-essential traffic,
such as downloads and updates. Mininet can simulate real-time SDN scenarios
because it is used to prototype whole architectures. It is also compatible with
controllers OpenDaylight and Ryu. It has tested the framework using the InSDN
dataset and proved that it can identify different kinds of cyberattacks and
handle bandwidth allocation efficiently under circumstances of resource
constraints. SmartSecChain-SDN comprehensively addresses SDN system protection,

Conclusion: 提出的混合框架为使用PINNs求解PDEs提供了更稳健的方法，通过结合两种策略克服了单一方法的局限性。

Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has emerged as a promising framework for
solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Nevertheless, training these
models on complex problems remains challenging, often leading to limited
accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we introduce a hybrid adaptive sampling
and weighting method to enhance the performance of physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). The adaptive sampling component identifies training points in
regions where the solution exhibits rapid variation, while the adaptive
weighting component balances the convergence rate across training points.
Numerical experiments show that applying only adaptive sampling or only
adaptive weighting is insufficient to consistently achieve accurate
predictions, particularly when training points are scarce. Since each method
emphasizes different aspects of the solution, their effectiveness is problem
dependent. By combining both strategies, the proposed framework consistently
improves prediction accuracy and training efficiency, offering a more robust
approach for solving PDEs with PINNs.

TL;DR: DuetServe是一个统一的LLM服务框架，通过在单个GPU内实现预填充和解码阶段的动态解耦，解决了现有方法中预填充与解码阶段干扰或资源浪费的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM服务系统需要在计算密集的预填充阶段和内存受限的解码阶段同时维持高吞吐量和低延迟。现有方法要么在共享GPU上聚合两个阶段导致干扰，要么跨GPU解耦造成资源浪费。

Method: DuetServe默认工作在聚合模式，当预测到时间间隔令牌(TBT)退化时动态激活SM级GPU空间多路复用。通过细粒度的自适应SM分区，仅在竞争威胁延迟SLO时解耦预填充和解码执行。

Result: 评估显示，DuetServe相比最先进框架，在保持低生成延迟的同时，总吞吐量提高了1.3倍。

Conclusion: DuetServe通过智能的SM分区和动态解耦机制，在单个GPU内实现了高效的LLM服务，平衡了吞吐量和延迟需求。

Abstract: Modern LLM serving systems must sustain high throughput while meeting strict
latency SLOs across two distinct inference phases: compute-intensive prefill
and memory-bound decode phases. Existing approaches either (1) aggregate both
phases on shared GPUs, leading to interference between prefill and decode
phases, which degrades time-between-tokens (TBT); or (2) disaggregate the two
phases across GPUs, improving latency but wasting resources through duplicated
models and KV cache transfers. We present DuetServe, a unified LLM serving
framework that achieves disaggregation-level isolation within a single GPU.
DuetServe operates in aggregated mode by default and dynamically activates
SM-level GPU spatial multiplexing when TBT degradation is predicted. Its key
idea is to decouple prefill and decode execution only when needed through
fine-grained, adaptive SM partitioning that provides phase isolation only when
contention threatens latency service level objectives (SLOs). DuetServe
integrates (1) an attention-aware roofline model to forecast iteration latency,
(2) a partitioning optimizer that selects the optimal SM split to maximize
throughput under TBT constraints, and (3) an interruption-free execution engine
that eliminates CPU-GPU synchronization overhead. Evaluations show that
DuetServe improves total throughput by up to 1.3x while maintaining low
generation latency compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.

Conclusion: PuzzleMoE提供了一种高效且无需训练的MoE压缩解决方案，显著减少内存占用同时保持模型性能

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown strong potential in scaling
language models efficiently by activating only a small subset of experts per
input. However, their widespread deployment remains limited due to the high
memory overhead associated with storing all expert parameters, particularly as
the number of experts increases. To address this challenge, prior works have
explored expert dropping and merging strategies, yet they often suffer from
performance drop at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce
PuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high
accuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE
performs sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy
and specialization. It uses a dual-mask to capture both shared and
expert-specific parameters. Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary
masks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses
underutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up
to 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks. Specifically, it
outperforms prior MoE compression methods by up to 16.7% on MMLU at 50%
compression ratio, and achieves up to 1.28\times inference speedup.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and
complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to
a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions.
This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic
misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats,
and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only
revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and
complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging
environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online
distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by
learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output
distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format.
Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven
exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal
dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world
model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks,
including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the
effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal
computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective
in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle,
demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based
agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases
the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the promise of
unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) methods for enhancing reasoning
capabilities without external supervision. However, the generalizability of
these label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning
capabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate
the performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and
reasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals
critical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's
pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below
baseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate
sufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective
self-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in
determining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet
effective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to
progressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority
rollouts during training. Additionally, we introduce a data curation pipeline
to generate samples with predefined difficulty. Our approach demonstrates
consistent improvements across all model sizes and reasoning capabilities,
providing a path toward more robust unsupervised RL that can bootstrap
reasoning abilities in resource-constrained models. We make our code available

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is critical for regulatory
compliance and for building ethical generative AI systems that avoid producing
private, toxic, illegal, or copyrighted content. Despite rapid progress, in
this work we show that \textit{almost all} existing unlearning methods fail to
achieve true forgetting in practice. Specifically, while evaluations of these
`unlearned' models under deterministic (greedy) decoding often suggest
successful knowledge removal using standard benchmarks (as has been done in the
literature), we show that sensitive information reliably resurfaces when models
are sampled with standard probabilistic decoding. To rigorously capture this
vulnerability, we introduce \texttt{leak@$k$}, a new meta-evaluation metric
that quantifies the likelihood of forgotten knowledge reappearing when
generating $k$ samples from the model under realistic decoding strategies.
Using three widely adopted benchmarks, TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP, we conduct the
first large-scale, systematic study of unlearning reliability using our newly
defined \texttt{leak@$k$} metric. Our findings demonstrate that knowledge
leakage persists across methods and tasks, underscoring that current
state-of-the-art unlearning techniques provide only limited forgetting and
highlighting the urgent need for more robust approaches to LLM unlearning.

Result: 在GPT2上的实验表明，该方法可节省约80%计算量或实现5倍加速，同时达到与完全训练的60层70亿参数模型几乎相同的损失。

Conclusion: 渐进训练是实现计算效率与模型性能平衡的有效策略，特别适用于大规模模型训练。

Abstract: Model depth is a double-edged sword in deep learning: deeper models achieve
higher accuracy but require higher computational cost. To efficiently train
models at scale, an effective strategy is the progressive training, which
scales up model capacity during training, hence significantly reducing
computation with little to none performance degradation. In this work, we study
the depth expansion of large models through the lens of optimization theory and
feature learning, offering insights on the initialization of new layers,
hyperparameter transfer, learning rate schedule, and timing of model expansion.
Specifically, we propose zero/one-layer progressive training for the optimal
tradeoff between computation and loss. For example, zero/one-layer progressive
training on GPT2 can save $\approx 80\%$ compute, or equivalently accelerate
$\approx 5\times$ while achieving almost the same loss, compared to to a fully
trained 60-layer model with 7B parameters.

Motivation: 当前电路发现方法如路径修补计算成本高，限制了在小模型上的深入分析。需要一种能大幅减少搜索空间的方法。

Method: APP采用两阶段方法：1) 使用对比性FLAP剪枝算法识别任务特定注意力头，减少搜索空间56%；2) 在剩余注意力头上应用传统路径修补。

Result: APP相比密集模型上的路径修补，加速59.63%-93.27%，同时发现的电路与之前路径修补电路有显著重叠和相似性能。

Conclusion: APP在保持电路质量的同时大幅降低了电路发现的计算成本，解决了当前方法的局限性。

Abstract: Circuit discovery is a key step in many mechanistic interpretability
pipelines. Current methods, such as Path Patching, are computationally
expensive and have limited in-depth circuit analysis for smaller models. In
this study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach
leveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically
reduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP
pruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign
higher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher
performing sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques. Although
Contrastive-FLAP is successful at preserving task-specific heads that existing
pruning algorithms remove at low sparsity ratios, the circuits found by
Contrastive-FLAP alone are too large to satisfy the minimality constraint
required in circuit analysis. APP first applies Contrastive-FLAP to reduce the
search space on required for circuit discovery algorithms by, on average, 56\%.
Next, APP, applies traditional Path Patching on the remaining attention heads,
leading to a speed up of 59.63\%-93.27\% compared to Path Patching applied to
the dense model. Despite the substantial computational saving that APP
provides, circuits obtained from APP exhibit substantial overlap and similar
performance to previously established Path Patching circuits

TL;DR: CAT（压缩与注意力变换器）是一种高效Transformer架构，通过压缩历史序列块来减少注意力计算成本，同时保持密集注意力机制的质量。它支持多块大小训练，可在测试时动态调整质量-计算权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统高效注意力方法（如稀疏注意力、滑动窗口等）在质量-计算权衡上的固定性和复杂性，这些方法往往牺牲上下文回忆性能，且需要复杂的启发式设计。

Method: 使用两个简单组件：密集注意力和压缩机制。通过将序列分块，在解码时只关注压缩后的历史块，从而减少序列长度。支持多块大小同时训练，实现测试时的自适应调整。

Result: 在语言建模、上下文回忆和长上下文理解任务中，单一自适应CAT模型优于现有高效基线，包括混合架构。与密集Transformer相比，在保持相同语言建模性能的同时，速度提升1.4-3倍，内存使用减少2-9倍。

Conclusion: CAT提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案，能够在不同计算-内存预算下实现最优性能，无需重新训练即可在测试时动态调整质量-效率权衡。

Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention in transformers motivated the development of
efficient approaches: namely sparse and sliding window attention, convolutions
and linear attention. Although these approaches result in impressive reductions
in compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically
in-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute
tradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications
require more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency
and memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that
artificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent
state update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at
specific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design
process, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress &
Attend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two
simple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of
tokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression
results in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and
memory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for
efficiency. Moreover, CAT can be trained with multiple chunk sizes at once,
unlocking control of quality-compute trade-offs directly at test-time without
any retraining, all in a single adaptive architecture. In exhaustive
evaluations on common language modeling tasks, in-context recall, and
long-context understanding, a single adaptive CAT model outperforms existing
efficient baselines, including hybrid architectures, across different
compute-memory budgets. Further, a single CAT matches dense transformer in
language modeling across model scales while being 1.4-3x faster and requiring
2-9x lower total memory usage.

Motivation: 代码语言模型在实际部署中面临高计算成本和环境影响，知识蒸馏是压缩模型的有效方法，但当前基于准确率的评估无法深入评估学生模型对教师模型行为保真度。

Method: 提出MetaCompress蜕变测试框架，通过一组行为保持的蜕变关系系统比较教师和学生模型的输出，评估行为保真度。

Result: MetaCompress在三个不同知识蒸馏技术（Compressor、AVATAR、MORPH）上识别出高达62%的行为差异，且学生模型在对抗攻击下性能下降高达285%。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏管道中需要行为保真度评估，MetaCompress是测试压缩代码语言模型行为保真度的实用框架。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models of code have achieved state-of-the-art
performance across a wide range of software analytics tasks, but their
practical deployment remains limited due to high computational costs, slow
inference speeds, and significant environmental impact. To address these
challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as
a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a
smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree
to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal
representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current
accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality
and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity
between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically
show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model,
resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks,
which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we
propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically
evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student
models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate
MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular
language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation
techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress
identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring
the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation
pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing
compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.

Motivation: 研究在数据稀缺和分布变化场景下，如何通过知识蒸馏来诱导和加速模型的grokking现象，解决实际部署中模型适应新分布时面临的数据不足问题。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏从已grokked的模型迁移知识到新分布，研究在联合分布训练和持续预训练场景下的效果，对比标准监督训练与蒸馏方法的表现。

Result: KD能够诱导和加速grokking，即使在数据低于临界阈值时也能实现泛化；在联合分布训练中，蒸馏方法优于标准训练；在持续预训练中，KD加速泛化并缓解灾难性遗忘，仅需10%数据即可获得强性能。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在低数据和演化分布设置中对于实现泛化具有核心作用，为grokking机制在知识迁移下的运作提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where models
exhibit delayed generalization following overfitting on training data. We focus
on data-scarce regimes where the number of training samples falls below the
critical threshold, making grokking unobservable, and on practical scenarios
involving distribution shift. We first show that Knowledge Distillation (KD)
from a model that has already grokked on a distribution (p1) can induce and
accelerate grokking on a different distribution (p2), even when the available
data lies below the critical threshold. This highlights the value of KD for
deployed models that must adapt to new distributions under limited data. We
then study training on the joint distribution (p1, p2) and demonstrate that
while standard supervised training fails when either distribution has
insufficient data, distilling from models grokked on the individual
distributions enables generalization. Finally, we examine a continual
pretraining setup, where a grokked model transitions from p1 to p2, and find
that KD both accelerates generalization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting,
achieving strong performance even with only 10% of the data. Together, our
results provide new insights into the mechanics of grokking under knowledge
transfer and underscore the central role of KD in enabling generalization in
low-data and evolving distribution settings.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative models such as Stable Diffusion and
ChatGPT has made them increasingly attractive targets for malicious
exploitation, particularly through data poisoning. Existing poisoning attacks
compromising synthesised data typically either cause broad degradation of
generated data or require control over the training process, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel data
poisoning technique called associative poisoning, which compromises
fine-grained features of the generated data without requiring control of the
training process. This attack perturbs only the training data to manipulate
statistical associations between specific feature pairs in the generated
outputs. We provide a formal mathematical formulation of the attack and prove
its theoretical feasibility and stealthiness. Empirical evaluations using two
state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that associative poisoning
effectively induces or suppresses feature associations while preserving the
marginal distributions of the targeted features and maintaining high-quality
outputs, thereby evading visual detection. These results suggest that
generative systems used in image synthesis, synthetic dataset generation, and
natural language processing are susceptible to subtle, stealthy manipulations
that compromise their statistical integrity. To address this risk, we examine
the limitations of existing defensive strategies and propose a novel
countermeasure strategy.

Abstract: As deep learning models scale, sparse computation and specialized dataflow
hardware have emerged as powerful solutions to address efficiency. We propose
FuseFlow, a compiler that converts sparse machine learning models written in
PyTorch to fused sparse dataflow graphs for reconfigurable dataflow
architectures (RDAs). FuseFlow is the first compiler to support general
cross-expression fusion of sparse operations. In addition to fusion across
kernels (expressions), FuseFlow also supports optimizations like
parallelization, dataflow ordering, and sparsity blocking. It targets a
cycle-accurate dataflow simulator for microarchitectural analysis of fusion
strategies. We use FuseFlow for design-space exploration across four real-world
machine learning applications with sparsity, showing that full fusion (entire
cross-expression fusion across all computation in an end-to-end model) is not
always optimal for sparse models-fusion granularity depends on the model
itself. FuseFlow also provides a heuristic to identify and prune suboptimal
configurations. Using Fuseflow, we achieve performance improvements, including
a ~2.7x speedup over an unfused baseline for GPT-3 with BigBird block-sparse
attention.

Method: 通过在不同训练数据量下测量极小值的体积，分析损失景观变化对极小值相对体积和泛化能力的影响。

Result: 研究发现存在泛化良好的尖锐极小值，但由于体积小而不易被发现。增加数据会改变损失景观，使这些泛化良好的极小值相对体积变大。

Conclusion: 大数据集的作用不仅是提供更多训练样本，更重要的是通过改变损失景观的几何结构，使泛化良好的极小值更容易被优化算法找到。

Abstract: The volume hypothesis suggests deep learning is effective because it is
likely to find flat minima due to their large volumes, and flat minima
generalize well. This picture does not explain the role of large datasets in
generalization. Measuring minima volumes under varying amounts of training data
reveals sharp minima which generalize well exist, but are unlikely to be found
due to their small volumes. Increasing data changes the loss landscape, such
that previously small generalizing minima become (relatively) large.

Conclusion: FAR-TS提供了一个简单有效的框架，能够快速、可控地生成长度任意的多变量时间序列，在保持数据质量的同时显著提升了生成效率。

Abstract: Generative models for multivariate time series are essential for data
augmentation, simulation, and privacy preservation, yet current
state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches are slow and limited to
fixed-length windows. We propose FAR-TS, a simple yet effective framework that
combines disentangled factorization with an autoregressive Transformer over a
discrete, quantized latent space to generate time series. Each time series is
decomposed into a data-adaptive basis that captures static cross-channel
correlations and temporal coefficients that are vector-quantized into discrete
tokens. A LLaMA-style autoregressive Transformer then models these token
sequences, enabling fast and controllable generation of sequences with
arbitrary length. Owing to its streamlined design, FAR-TS achieves
orders-of-magnitude faster generation than Diffusion-TS while preserving
cross-channel correlations and an interpretable latent space, enabling
high-quality and flexible time series synthesis.

Motivation: 联邦微调在异构客户端分布下容易因局部漂移导致系统性偏差和方差放大，现有方法主要事后修正，在极端非IID条件下表现脆弱。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上，OvA-LP在极端非IID条件下保持95.9%的IID准确率，显著优于现有方法(PFPT:10.1%, FFT-MoE:34.5%)，且在标签噪声下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OvA-LP为异构条件下的鲁棒联邦微调提供了原则性和高效的基础。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) adapts foundation models to decentralized data
but remains fragile under heterogeneous client distributions due to local
drift, i.e., client-level update divergences that induce systematic bias and
amplified variance in the global model. Existing aggregation and
personalization methods largely correct drift post hoc, which proves brittle
under extreme non-IID conditions. We introduce OvA-LP, a minimalist framework
that is, to our knowledge, the first explicitly designed to suppress drift at
its source within the PEFT-based FFT paradigm. OvA-LP combines linear probing
on a frozen encoder with a one-vs-all head and a simple two-stage procedure,
preserving pretrained feature geometry and decoupling logits to prevent the
mechanisms that amplify drift. On CIFAR-100 with 100 clients, averaged over
shard-1, shard-2, and Bernoulli-Dirichlet partitions, OvA-LP retains 95.9% of
its IID accuracy, whereas state-of-the-art FFT baselines retain only 10.1%
(PFPT) and 34.5% (FFT-MoE) under the same conditions. OvA-LP further maintains
resilience under both symmetric and asymmetric label noise. In addition,
precomputing encoder features makes per-round cost nearly independent of
encoder size. Together, these results demonstrate that OvA-LP provides a
principled and efficient basis for robust FFT under heterogeneity.

Abstract: Foundation models capable of generalizing across species and tasks represent
a promising new frontier in bioacoustics, with NatureLM being one of the most
prominent examples. While its domain-specific fine-tuning yields strong
performance on bioacoustic benchmarks, we observe that it also introduces
trade-offs in instruction-following flexibility. For instance, NatureLM
achieves high accuracy when prompted for either the common or scientific name
individually, but its accuracy drops significantly when both are requested in a
single prompt. We address this by applying a simple model merging strategy that
interpolates NatureLM with its base language model, recovering
instruction-following capabilities with minimal loss of domain expertise.
Finally, we show that the merged model exhibits markedly stronger zero-shot
generalization, achieving over a 200% relative improvement and setting a new
state-of-the-art in closed-set zero-shot classification of unseen species.

Abstract: Off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment
transition dynamics are different, can be formulated as learning in a robust
Markov decision process (RMDP) where uncertainties in transition dynamics are
imposed. Existing literature mostly assumes access to generative models
allowing arbitrary state-action queries or pre-collected datasets with a good
state coverage of the deployment environment, bypassing the challenge of
exploration. In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting
where the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment.
To capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we
introduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the
mismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show
that if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We
propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear
regret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We
also establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm
achieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the
number of interaction episodes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results
through comprehensive numerical experiments.

Abstract: We first study the generalization error of models that use a fixed feature
representation (frozen intermediate layers) followed by a trainable readout
layer. This setting encompasses a range of architectures, from deep
random-feature models to echo-state networks (ESNs) with recurrent dynamics.
Working in the high-dimensional regime, we apply Random Matrix Theory to derive
a closed-form expression for the asymptotic generalization error. We then apply
this analysis to recurrent representations and obtain concise formula that
characterize their performance. Surprisingly, we show that a linear ESN is
equivalent to ridge regression with an exponentially time-weighted (''memory'')
input covariance, revealing a clear inductive bias toward recent inputs.
Experiments match predictions: ESNs win in low-sample, short-memory regimes,
while ridge prevails with more data or long-range dependencies. Our methodology
provides a general framework for analyzing overparameterized models and offers
insights into the behavior of deep learning networks.

Abstract: Digital Adoption Platforms (DAPs) have become essential tools for helping
employees navigate complex enterprise software such as CRM, ERP, or HRMS
systems. Companies like LemonLearning have shown how digital guidance can
reduce training costs and accelerate onboarding. However, building and
maintaining these interactive guides still requires extensive manual effort.
Leveraging Large Language Models as virtual assistants is an appealing
alternative, yet without a structured understanding of the target software,
LLMs often hallucinate and produce unreliable answers. Moreover, most
production-grade LLMs are black-box APIs, making fine-tuning impractical due to
the lack of access to model weights. In this work, we introduce a Graph-based
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that automatically converts enterprise
web applications into state-action knowledge graphs, enabling LLMs to generate
grounded and context-aware assistance. The framework was co-developed with the
AI enterprise RAKAM, in collaboration with Lemon Learning. We detail the
engineering pipeline that extracts and structures software interfaces, the
design of the graph-based retrieval process, and the integration of our
approach into production DAP workflows. Finally, we discuss scalability,
robustness, and deployment lessons learned from industrial use cases.

Motivation: 现有MARL基准主要针对短期挑战，无法充分评估长期依赖和泛化能力，需要更具挑战性的基准来推动MARL研究发展。

Method: 基于Craftax环境扩展开发了Craftax-MA（支持多智能体）和Craftax-Coop（引入异构智能体、交易等复杂合作机制），使用JAX实现以获得高效性能。

Result: Craftax-MA训练2.5亿次交互仅需不到1小时，现有算法在长期信用分配、探索和合作等关键挑战上表现困难。

Conclusion: 该基准环境有潜力推动MARL的长期研究，特别是针对长期依赖和复杂合作场景。

Abstract: Progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires challenging
benchmarks that assess the limits of current methods. However, existing
benchmarks often target narrow short-horizon challenges that do not adequately
stress the long-term dependencies and generalization capabilities inherent in
many multi-agent systems. To address this, we first present
\textit{Craftax-MA}: an extension of the popular open-ended RL environment,
Craftax, that supports multiple agents and evaluates a wide range of general
abilities within a single environment. Written in JAX, \textit{Craftax-MA} is
exceptionally fast with a training run using 250 million environment
interactions completing in under an hour. To provide a more compelling
challenge for MARL, we also present \textit{Craftax-Coop}, an extension
introducing heterogeneous agents, trading and more mechanics that require
complex cooperation among agents for success. We provide analysis demonstrating
that existing algorithms struggle with key challenges in this benchmark,
including long-horizon credit assignment, exploration and cooperation, and
argue for its potential to drive long-term research in MARL.

<details>

Motivation: 解决多智能体协调中性能与计算效率的权衡问题：扩散方法性能好但计算慢，高斯策略方法快但协调能力弱。

Method: 首先学习基于流的联合行为表示，然后将其蒸馏为去中心化的一步策略。

Result: 在12个环境和34个数据集上，推理速度比基于扩散的MARL方法快约14.5倍，性能保持良好，推理速度与高斯策略方法相当。

Conclusion: MAC-Flow有效缓解了多智能体协调中性能与计算成本的权衡问题。

Abstract: This work presents MAC-Flow, a simple yet expressive framework for
multi-agent coordination. We argue that requirements of effective coordination
are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present
in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However,
prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising
diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally
slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling
multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a
flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into
decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast
execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and
$34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and
computational cost, specifically achieving about $\boldsymbol{\times14.5}$
faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining
good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of
prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
methods.

Abstract: Text offers intuitive access to information. This can, in particular,
complement the density of numerical time series, thereby allowing improved
interactions with time series models to enhance accessibility and
decision-making. While the creation of question-answering datasets and models
has recently seen remarkable growth, most research focuses on question
answering (QA) on vision and text, with time series receiving minute attention.
To bridge this gap, we propose a challenging novel time series QA (TSQA)
dataset, QuAnTS, for Question Answering on Time Series data. Specifically, we
pose a wide variety of questions and answers about human motion in the form of
tracked skeleton trajectories. We verify that the large-scale QuAnTS dataset is
well-formed and comprehensive through extensive experiments. Thoroughly
evaluating existing and newly proposed baselines then lays the groundwork for a
deeper exploration of TSQA using QuAnTS. Additionally, we provide human
performances as a key reference for gauging the practical usability of such
models. We hope to encourage future research on interacting with time series
models through text, enabling better decision-making and more transparent
systems.

Conclusion: 研究结果为构建高效的时空系统预测管道提供了可操作的见解，强调了根据传感器部署密度和采样频率选择合适模型架构的重要性。

Abstract: Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume
spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically
powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic
deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook
how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream
model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from
additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts.
This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different
forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a
systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural
networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs),
and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under
varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world
temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are
effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate,
leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for
limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies
but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced.
Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively
learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights
for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems. All
code for model configurations, training, dataset, and logs are open-sourced for

Abstract: Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of
complex phenomena and, ultimately, better decisions. Representation learning
has become a key driver of deep learning applications, as it allows learning
latent spaces that capture important properties of the data without requiring
any supervised annotations. Although representation learning has been hugely
successful in predictive tasks, it can fail miserably in causal tasks including
predicting the effect of a perturbation/intervention. This calls for a marriage
between representation learning and causal inference. An exciting opportunity
in this regard stems from the growing availability of multi-modal data
(observational and perturbational, imaging-based and sequencing-based, at the
single-cell level, tissue-level, and organism-level). We outline a statistical
and computational framework for causal structure and representation learning
motivated by fundamental biomedical questions: how to effectively use
observational and perturbational data to perform causal discovery on observed
causal variables; how to use multi-modal views of the system to learn causal
variables; and how to design optimal perturbations.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have raised concerns about
their potential to produce harmful content when provided with malicious input
text prompts. To address this issue, two main approaches have emerged: (1)
fine-tuning the model to unlearn harmful concepts and (2) training-free
guidance methods that leverage negative prompts. However, we observe that
combining these two orthogonal approaches often leads to marginal or even
degraded defense performance. This observation indicates a critical
incompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined
effectiveness. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a conceptually
simple yet experimentally robust method: replacing the negative prompts used in
training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through
concept inversion. Our method requires no modification to either approach and
can be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We experimentally validate
its effectiveness on nudity and violence benchmarks, demonstrating consistent
improvements in defense success rate while preserving the core semantics of
input prompts.

Abstract: Many real-world decisions are made under uncertainty by solving optimization
problems using predicted quantities. This predict-then-optimize paradigm has
motivated decision-focused learning, which trains models with awareness of how
the optimizer uses predictions, improving the performance of downstream
decisions. Despite its promise, scaling is challenging: state-of-the-art
methods either differentiate through a solver or rely on task-specific
surrogates, both of which require frequent and expensive calls to an optimizer,
often a combinatorial one. In this paper, we leverage dual variables from the
downstream problem to shape learning and introduce Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a
simple, scalable objective that preserves decision alignment while reducing
solver dependence. We construct DGL specifically for combinatorial selection
problems with natural one-of-many constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and
shortest path. Our approach (a) decouples optimization from gradient updates by
solving the downstream problem only periodically; (b) between refreshes, trains
on dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses; and (c)
as refreshes become less frequent, drives training cost toward standard
supervised learning while retaining strong decision alignment. We prove that
DGL has asymptotically diminishing decision regret, analyze runtime complexity,
and show on two problem classes that DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art
DFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training
time. Code is available at https://github.com/paularodr/Dual-Guided-Learning.

Abstract: Pre-trained Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) represent a significant
advance, capable of forecasting diverse time series with complex
characteristics, including varied seasonalities, trends, and long-range
dependencies. Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting,
their efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data
sources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across
different forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this
complementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a
compelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In
this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit
specialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how
we can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time
series models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and
forecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration
strategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration
framework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of
TSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative,
context-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by
adaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models.
Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other
popular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating
Synapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Forecasting long-term time series in IoT environments remains a significant
challenge due to the non-stationary and multi-scale characteristics of sensor
signals. Furthermore, error accumulation causes a decrease in forecast quality
when predicting further into the future. Traditional methods are restricted to
operate in time-domain, while the global frequency information achieved by
Fourier transform would be regarded as stationary signals leading to blur the
temporal patterns of transient events. We propose AWEMixer, an Adaptive
Wavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network including two innovative components: 1) a
Frequency Router designs to utilize the global periodicity pattern achieved by
Fast Fourier Transform to adaptively weight localized wavelet subband, and 2) a
Coherent Gated Fusion Block to achieve selective integration of prominent
frequency features with multi-scale temporal representation through
cross-attention and gating mechanism, which realizes accurate time-frequency
localization while remaining robust to noise. Seven public benchmarks validate

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop calibration is often addressed via preference-based
optimization, where algorithms learn from pairwise comparisons rather than
explicit cost evaluations. While effective, methods such as Preferential
Bayesian Optimization or Global optimization based on active preference
learning with radial basis functions (GLISp) treat the system as a black box
and ignore informative sensor measurements. In this work, we introduce a
sensor-guided regularized extension of GLISp that integrates measurable
descriptors into the preference-learning loop through a physics-informed
hypothesis function and a least-squares regularization term. This injects
grey-box structure, combining subjective feedback with quantitative sensor
information while preserving the flexibility of preference-based search.
Numerical evaluations on an analytical benchmark and on a human-in-the-loop

Abstract: Multicalibration [HJKRR18] is an algorithmic fairness perspective that
demands that the predictions of a predictor are correct conditional on
themselves and membership in a collection of potentially overlapping subgroups
of a population. The work of [NR23] established a surprising connection between
multicalibration for an arbitrary property $\Gamma$ (e.g., mean or median) and
property elicitation: a property $\Gamma$ can be multicalibrated if and only if
it is elicitable, where elicitability is the notion that the true property
value of a distribution can be obtained by solving a regression problem over
the distribution. In the online setting, [NR23] proposed an inefficient
algorithm that achieves $\sqrt T$ $\ell_2$-multicalibration error for a
hypothesis class of group membership functions and an elicitable property
$\Gamma$, after $T$ rounds of interaction between a forecaster and adversary.
  In this paper, we generalize multicalibration for an elicitable property
$\Gamma$ from group membership functions to arbitrary bounded hypothesis
classes and introduce a stronger notion -- swap multicalibration, following
[GKR23]. Subsequently, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm which, when
given access to an online agnostic learner, achieves $T^{1/(r+1)}$
$\ell_r$-swap multicalibration error with high probability (for $r\ge2$) for a
hypothesis class with bounded sequential Rademacher complexity and an
elicitable property $\Gamma$. For the special case of $r=2$, this implies an
oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $T^{1/3}$ $\ell_2$-swap
multicalibration error, which significantly improves on the previously
established bounds for the problem [NR23, GMS25, LSS25a], and completely
resolves an open question raised in [GJRR24] on the possibility of an
oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $\sqrt{T}$ $\ell_2$-mean
multicalibration error by answering it in a strongly affirmative sense.

Authors elaborate on the application of these frameworks on different models

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式考虑生成和评估成本，以及人类反馈的感知模糊性，有效提升了偏好贝叶斯优化的性能。

Abstract: Preferential Bayesian optimization allows optimization of objectives that are
either expensive or difficult to measure directly, by relying on a minimal
number of comparative evaluations done by a human expert. Generating candidate
solutions for evaluation is also often expensive, but this cost is ignored by
existing methods. We generalize preference-based optimization to explicitly
account for production and evaluation costs with Consecutive Preferential
Bayesian Optimization, reducing production cost by constraining comparisons to
involve previously generated candidates. We also account for the perceptual
ambiguity of the oracle providing the feedback by incorporating a
Just-Noticeable Difference threshold into a probabilistic preference model to
capture indifference to small utility differences. We adapt an
information-theoretic acquisition strategy to this setting, selecting new
configurations that are most informative about the unknown optimum under a
preference model accounting for the perceptual ambiguity. We empirically
demonstrate a notable increase in accuracy in setups with high production costs
or with indifference feedback.

Abstract: Judea Pearl's vision of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as engines for
counterfactual reasoning hinges on faithful abduction: the precise inference of
latent exogenous noise. For decades, operationalizing this step for complex,
non-linear mechanisms has remained a significant computational challenge. The
advent of diffusion models, powerful universal function approximators, offers a
promising solution. However, we argue that their standard design, optimized for
perceptual generation over logical inference, introduces a fundamental flaw for
this classical problem: an inherent information loss we term the Structural
Reconstruction Error (SRE). To address this challenge, we formalize the
principle of Causal Information Conservation (CIC) as the necessary condition
for faithful abduction. We then introduce BELM-MDCM, the first diffusion-based
framework engineered to be causally sound by eliminating SRE by construction
through an analytically invertible mechanism. To operationalize this framework,
a Targeted Modeling strategy provides structural regularization, while a Hybrid
Training Objective instills a strong causal inductive bias. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our Zero-SRE framework not only achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but, more importantly, enables the high-fidelity,
individual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries. Our work
provides a foundational blueprint that reconciles the power of modern
generative models with the rigor of classical causal theory, establishing a new
and more rigorous standard for this emerging field.

Abstract: The emergence of truck-drone collaborative systems in last-mile logistics has
positioned the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D) as a pivotal
extension of classical routing optimization, where synchronized vehicle
coordination promises substantial operational efficiency and reduced
environmental impact, yet introduces NP-hard combinatorial complexity beyond
the reach of conventional optimization paradigms. Deep reinforcement learning
offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent
challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive
decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep
reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The
architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder
and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel,
optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for
focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration
of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded
representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire
framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm.
Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales
(N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior
solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance
heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods. Moreover,
compared to advanced reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarks, the proposed
framework significantly reduces the total training time required while
achieving superior final performance, highlighting its notable advantage in
training efficiency.

Abstract: Balancing strong privacy guarantees with high predictive performance is
critical for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks involving Electronic Health
Records (EHR). In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate
Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with
synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by
reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key
challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original
training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to
enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple
augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO
constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to
strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental
results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA
attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.

Abstract: Multimodal product retrieval systems in e-commerce platforms rely on
effectively combining visual and textual signals to improve search relevance
and user experience. However, vision-language models such as CLIP are
vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading or irrelevant text embedded
in images skews model predictions. In this work, we propose a novel method that
reverses the logic of typographic attacks by rendering relevant textual content
(e.g., titles, descriptions) directly onto product images to perform
vision-text compression, thereby strengthening image-text alignment and
boosting multimodal product retrieval performance. We evaluate our method on
three vertical-specific e-commerce datasets (sneakers, handbags, and trading
cards) using six state-of-the-art vision foundation models. Our experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements in unimodal and multimodal retrieval
accuracy across categories and model families. Our findings suggest that
visually rendering product metadata is a simple yet effective enhancement for
zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce applications.

Abstract: Embedding non-restrictive prior knowledge, such as energy conservation laws,
in learning-based approaches is a key motive to construct physically consistent
models from limited data, relevant for, e.g., model-based control. Recent work
incorporates Hamiltonian dynamics into Gaussian Process (GP) regression to
obtain uncertainty-quantifying models that adhere to the underlying physical
principles. However, these works rely on velocity or momentum data, which is
rarely available in practice. In this paper, we consider dynamics learning with
non-conservative Hamiltonian GPs, and address the more realistic problem
setting of learning from input-output data. We provide a fully Bayesian scheme
for estimating probability densities of unknown hidden states, of GP
hyperparameters, as well as of structural hyperparameters, such as damping
coefficients. Considering the computational complexity of GPs, we take
advantage of a reduced-rank GP approximation and leverage its properties for
computationally efficient prediction and training. The proposed method is
evaluated in a nonlinear simulation case study and compared to a
state-of-the-art approach that relies on momentum measurements.

Abstract: Flow matching (FM) has shown promising results in data-driven planning.
However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action
constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for
the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems.
Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which
potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by
proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and
Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of
the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be
derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal
guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency.
Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time
satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across
several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various
generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.

Abstract: Graph network-based simulators (GNS) have demonstrated strong potential for
learning particle-based physics (such as fluids, deformable solids, and
granular flows) while generalizing to unseen geometries due to their inherent
inductive biases. However, existing models are typically trained for a single
material type and fail to generalize across distinct constitutive behaviors,
limiting their applicability in real-world engineering settings. Using granular
flows as a running example, we propose a parameter-efficient conditioning
mechanism that makes the GNS model adaptive to material parameters. We identify
that sensitivity to material properties is concentrated in the early
message-passing (MP) layers, a finding we link to the local nature of
constitutive models (e.g., Mohr-Coulomb) and their effects on information
propagation. We empirically validate this by showing that fine-tuning only the
first few (1-5) of 10 MP layers of a pretrained model achieves comparable test
performance as compared to fine-tuning the entire network. Building on this
insight, we propose a parameter-efficient Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM)
conditioning mechanism designed to specifically target these early layers. This
approach produces accurate long-term rollouts on unseen, interpolated, or
moderately extrapolated values (e.g., up to 2.5 degrees for friction angle and
0.25 kPa for cohesion) when trained exclusively on as few as 12 short
simulation trajectories from new materials, representing a 5-fold data
reduction compared to a baseline multi-task learning method. Finally, we
validate the model's utility by applying it to an inverse problem, successfully
identifying unknown cohesion parameters from trajectory data. This approach
enables the use of GNS in inverse design and closed-loop control tasks where
material properties are treated as design variables.

Abstract: Predicting the effect of amino acid mutations on enzyme thermodynamic
stability (DDG) is fundamental to protein engineering and drug design. While
recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence
and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate
coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We
present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that
co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and
transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a
bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings
guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2)
transformer representations refine GNN message passing through
attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis
showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds
than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves
state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with
6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion
mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis
proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling,
with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work
establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein

Abstract: We consider the problem of communication-constrained collaborative
personalized mean estimation under a privacy constraint in an environment of
several agents continuously receiving data according to arbitrary unknown
agent-specific distributions. A consensus-based algorithm is studied under the
framework of differential privacy in order to protect each agent's data. We
give a theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed consensus-based
algorithm for any bounded unknown distributions on the agents' data, showing
that collaboration provides faster convergence than a fully local approach
where agents do not share data, under an oracle decision rule and under some
restrictions on the privacy level and the agents' connectivity, which
illustrates the benefit of private collaboration in an online setting under a
communication restriction on the agents. The theoretical faster-than-local
convergence guarantee is backed up by several numerical results.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) shows heterogeneous, evolving brain-morphometry
patterns. Modeling these longitudinal trajectories enables mechanistic insight,
treatment development, and individualized 'digital-twin' forecasting. However,
existing methods usually adopt recurrent neural networks and transformer
architectures, which rely on discrete, regularly sampled data while struggling
to handle irregular and sparse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PD cohorts.
Moreover, these methods have difficulty capturing individual heterogeneity
including variations in disease onset, progression rate, and symptom severity,
which is a hallmark of PD. To address these challenges, we propose CNODE
(Conditional Neural ODE), a novel framework for continuous, individualized PD
progression forecasting. The core of CNODE is to model morphological brain
changes as continuous temporal processes using a neural ODE model. In addition,
we jointly learn patient-specific initial time and progress speed to align
individual trajectories into a shared progression trajectory. We validate CNODE
on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in

Abstract: We introduce Simplex-FEM Networks (SiFEN), a learned piecewise-polynomial

on a learned simplicial mesh in an optionally warped input space. Each query
activates exactly one simplex and at most d+1 basis functions via barycentric
coordinates, yielding explicit locality, controllable smoothness, and
cache-friendly sparsity. SiFEN pairs degree-m Bernstein-Bezier polynomials with
a light invertible warp and trains end-to-end with shape regularization,
semi-discrete OT coverage, and differentiable edge flips. Under standard
shape-regularity and bi-Lipschitz warp assumptions, SiFEN achieves the classic
FEM approximation rate M^(-m/d) with M mesh vertices. Empirically, on synthetic
approximation tasks, tabular regression/classification, and as a drop-in head
on compact CNNs, SiFEN matches or surpasses MLPs and KANs at matched parameter
budgets, improves calibration (lower ECE/Brier), and reduces inference latency

donations to ensure equitable and efficient resource distribution. Traditional
forecasting models often fail to maintain consistent accuracy due to
unpredictable fluctuations and concept drift driven by seasonal variations and
natural disasters such as hurricanes in the Southeastern U.S. and wildfires in
the West Coast. To address these challenges, we propose FoodRL, a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) based metalearning framework that clusters and
dynamically weights diverse forecasting models based on recent performance and
contextual information. Evaluated on multi-year data from two structurally
distinct U.S. food banks-one large regional West Coast food bank affected by
wildfires and another state-level East Coast food bank consistently impacted by
hurricanes, FoodRL consistently outperforms baseline methods, particularly
during periods of disruption or decline. By delivering more reliable and
adaptive forecasts, FoodRL can facilitate the redistribution of food equivalent
to 1.7 million additional meals annually, demonstrating its significant
potential for social impact as well as adaptive ensemble learning for
humanitarian supply chains.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be commercially available in the
near future, leading to mixed autonomy traffic consisting of both AVs and
human-driven vehicles (HVs). Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can
be deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating
system-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the
benefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to
all driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand
whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed
autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective
rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral
economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when
pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of
CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed
human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained
among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a
simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic
agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives.
Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates
the robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the
emergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based
on simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging
advanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective
cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk
prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal
dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack
of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder
or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional
embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to
preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is
trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and
substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving
the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the
depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms
the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the
Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key
clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal
inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific
medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified
by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk
assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In
summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease
risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.

Method: 通过推导流匹配分布近似的KL散度上界，建立L2流匹配损失与KL散度之间的关系，分析流匹配在总变差距离下的统计收敛率。

Result: 当L2流匹配损失≤ε²时，KL散度上界为A₁ε + A₂ε²，其中常数A₁、A₂仅依赖于数据和速度场的正则性，流匹配在估计光滑分布时达到接近极小极大最优效率。

Conclusion: 流匹配在总变差距离下具有与扩散模型相当的统计效率，数值研究验证了理论结果。

Abstract: We derive a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation. In particular,
if the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 > 0$, then the KL
divergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is
bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$
depend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. Consequently,
this bound implies statistical convergence rates of Flow Matching Transformers
under the Total Variation (TV) distance. We show that, flow matching achieves
nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions. Our
results make the statistical efficiency of flow matching comparable to that of
diffusion models under the TV distance. Numerical studies on synthetic and
learned velocities corroborate our theory.

Abstract: In this study, a scalable online kernel learning framework is proposed for
estimating bidirectional causal effects in systems characterized by mutual
dependence and heteroskedasticity. Traditional causal inference often focuses
on unidirectional effects, overlooking the common bidirectional relationships
in real-world phenomena. Building on heteroskedasticity-based identification,
the proposed method integrates a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator for
simultaneous equation models with large scale online kernel learning. It
employs random Fourier feature approximations to flexibly model nonlinear
conditional means and variances, while an adaptive online gradient descent
algorithm ensures computational efficiency for streaming and high-dimensional
data. Results from extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior accuracy and stability than single equation and polynomial
approximation baselines, exhibiting lower bias and root mean squared error
across various data-generating processes. These results confirm that the
proposed approach effectively captures complex bidirectional causal effects
with near-linear computational scaling. By combining econometric identification
with modern machine learning techniques, the proposed framework offers a
practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded solution for large scale causal
inference in natural/social science, policy making, business, and industrial
applications.

Abstract: Simulating object deformations is a critical challenge across many scientific
domains, including robotics, manufacturing, and structural mechanics. Learned
Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional
mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make
them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate
simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization.
However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step
observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without
this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties.
Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error
for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a
trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our
method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited
initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize
movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations
from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive
Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of
the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.

Abstract: This work investigates the structural properties, cycloid trajectories, and
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown mixing
weights and regression parameters. Recent studies have established global
convergence for 2MLR with known balanced weights and super-linear convergence
in noiseless and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. However, the
theoretical behavior of EM in the fully unknown setting remains unclear, with
its trajectory and convergence order not yet fully characterized. We derive
explicit EM update expressions for 2MLR with unknown mixing weights and
regression parameters across all SNR regimes and analyze their structural
properties and cycloid trajectories. In the noiseless case, we prove that the
trajectory of the regression parameters in EM iterations traces a cycloid by
establishing a recurrence relation for the sub-optimality angle, while in high
SNR regimes we quantify its discrepancy from the cycloid trajectory. The
trajectory-based analysis reveals the order of convergence: linear when the EM
estimate is nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, and quadratic when the angle
between the estimate and ground truth is small at the population level. Our
analysis establishes non-asymptotic guarantees by sharpening bounds on
statistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, relating
EM's statistical accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence
with arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level. This work provides a
novel trajectory-based framework for analyzing EM in Mixed Linear Regression.

Abstract: As smart grids evolve to meet growing energy demands and modern operational
challenges, the ability to accurately predict faults becomes increasingly
critical. However, existing AI-based fault prediction models struggle to ensure
reliability in evolving environments where they are required to adapt to new
fault types and operational zones. In this paper, we propose a continual

with the environment. We design four realistic evaluation scenarios grounded in
class-incremental and domain-incremental learning to emulate evolving grid
conditions. We further introduce Prototype-based Dark Experience Replay
(ProDER), a unified replay-based approach that integrates prototype-based
feature regularization, logit distillation, and a prototype-guided replay
memory. ProDER achieves the best performance among tested CL techniques, with
only a 0.045 accuracy drop for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone
prediction. These results demonstrate the practicality of CL for scalable,
real-world fault prediction in smart grids.

Abstract: Accurate short-term precipitation forecasts predominantly rely on dense
weather-radar networks, limiting operational value in places most exposed to
climate extremes. We present TUPANN (Transferable and Universal Physics-Aligned
Nowcasting Network), a satellite-only model trained on GOES-16 RRQPE. Unlike
most deep learning models for nowcasting, TUPANN decomposes the forecast into
physically meaningful components: a variational encoder-decoder infers motion
and intensity fields from recent imagery under optical-flow supervision, a
lead-time-conditioned MaxViT evolves the latent state, and a differentiable
advection operator reconstructs future frames. We evaluate TUPANN on both
GOES-16 and IMERG data, in up to four distinct climates (Rio de Janeiro,
Manaus, Miami, La Paz) at 10-180min lead times using the CSI and HSS metrics
over 4-64 mm/h thresholds. Comparisons against optical-flow, deep learning and
hybrid baselines show that TUPANN achieves the best or second-best skill in
most settings, with pronounced gains at higher thresholds. Training on multiple
cities further improves performance, while cross-city experiments show modest
degradation and occasional gains for rare heavy-rain regimes. The model
produces smooth, interpretable motion fields aligned with numerical optical
flow and runs in near real time due to the low latency of GOES-16. These
results indicate that physically aligned learning can provide nowcasts that are
skillful, transferable and global.

Abstract: Score-based models can serve as expressive, data-driven priors for scientific
inverse problems. In strong gravitational lensing, they enable posterior
inference of a background galaxy from its distorted, multiply-imaged
observation. Previous work, however, assumes that the lens mass distribution
(and thus the forward operator) is known. We relax this assumption by jointly
inferring the source and a parametric lens-mass profile, using a sampler based
on GibbsDDRM but operating in continuous time. The resulting reconstructions
yield residuals consistent with the observational noise, and the marginal
posteriors of the lens parameters recover true values without systematic bias.
To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of joint
source-and-lens inference with a score-based prior.

TL;DR: TwinVLA是一个模块化框架，将两个预训练的单臂视觉语言动作模型组合成协调的双臂VLA，无需双臂预训练即可在双臂任务中超越同等规模的整体模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有公开数据集主要关注单臂演示，而将VLA适应双臂任务通常需要大量额外双臂数据和微调的问题。

Method: 通过组合两个预训练的单臂VLA模型，构建协调的双臂VLA框架，利用公共单臂数据实现数据高效的双臂操作。

Result: 在真实世界和仿真环境中的多样化双臂任务中，TwinVLA优于同等规模的RDT-1B整体模型，且无需任何双臂预训练，缩小了与依赖大量专有双臂数据的最先进模型π0的差距。

Conclusion: 模块化组合方法为高性能双臂操作提供了一条数据高效且可扩展的路径，充分利用了公共单臂数据。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) trained on large-scale robotic datasets
have demonstrated strong performance on manipulation tasks, including bimanual
tasks. However, because most public datasets focus on single-arm
demonstrations, adapting VLAs for bimanual tasks typically requires substantial
additional bimanual data and fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we
introduce TwinVLA, a modular framework that composes two copies of a pretrained
single-arm VLA into a coordinated bimanual VLA. Unlike monolithic
cross-embodiment models trained on mixtures of single-arm and bimanual data,
TwinVLA improves both data efficiency and performance by composing pretrained
single-arm policies. Across diverse bimanual tasks in real-world and simulation
settings, TwinVLA outperforms a comparably-sized monolithic RDT-1B model
without requiring any bimanual pretraining. Furthermore, it narrows the gap to
state-of-the-art model, $\pi_0$ which rely on extensive proprietary bimanual
data and compute cost. These results establish our modular composition approach
as a data-efficient and scalable path toward high-performance bimanual
manipulation, leveraging public single-arm data.

Motivation: 现有rsfMRI模型大多忽视神经元振荡的多频特性，将BOLD信号视为单一时间序列，这限制了神经疾病诊断的敏感性和特异性。虽然有些方法尝试纳入频率信息，但依赖预定义频带，无法捕捉个体差异和疾病特异性改变。

Conclusion: 该框架通过自适应学习频率子带和捕获跨频带交互，提高了rsfMRI在脑疾病诊断中的性能。

Abstract: Resting-state fMRI has become a valuable tool for classifying brain disorders
and constructing brain functional connectivity networks
  by tracking BOLD signals across brain regions. However, existing mod els
largely neglect the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations,
  treating BOLD signals as monolithic time series. This overlooks the cru cial
fact that neurological disorders often manifest as disruptions within
  specific frequency bands, limiting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
  While some methods have attempted to incorporate frequency informa tion, they
often rely on predefined frequency bands, which may not be
  optimal for capturing individual variability or disease-specific alterations.
  To address this, we propose a novel framework featuring Adaptive Cas cade
Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands for each
  brain region and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to capture
  both intra- and nuanced cross-band interactions in a unified functional
  network. This unified network informs a novel message-passing mecha nism
within our Unified-GCN, generating refined node representations
  for diagnostic prediction. Experimental results on the ADNI and ABIDE
  datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods. The

TL;DR: SPECTRA是一个光谱目标感知的图增强框架，通过光谱域生成真实的分子图来解决分子属性预测中稀有但关键化合物的稀疏性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分子属性预测中，最有价值的化合物（如高效力）通常占据目标空间的稀疏区域。标准图神经网络通常优化平均误差，在这些不常见但关键的情况下表现不佳，现有的过采样方法经常扭曲分子拓扑结构。

Method: SPECTRA框架：(i)从SMILES重建多属性分子图；(ii)通过融合Gromov-Wasserstein耦合对齐分子对以获得节点对应关系；(iii)在稳定共享基中插值拉普拉斯特征值、特征向量和节点特征；(iv)重建边以合成具有插值目标的物理合理中间体。结合使用边缘感知切比雪夫卷积的光谱GNN。

Result: 在基准测试中，SPECTRA在相关目标范围内持续改进误差，同时保持竞争力的整体MAE，并产生可解释的合成分子，其结构反映了底层光谱几何。

Conclusion: 光谱、几何感知增强是解决不平衡分子属性回归问题的有效且高效策略。

Abstract: In molecular property prediction, the most valuable compounds (e.g., high
potency) often occupy sparse regions of the target space. Standard Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on
these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often
distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral
Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular
graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute
molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused)
Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates
Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis;
and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates
with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a
kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are
scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions,
SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy.
On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges
while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic
molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our
results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective
and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.

Abstract: We study adversarially robust multitask adaptive linear quadratic control; a
setting where multiple systems collaboratively learn control policies under

approach that integrates clustering and system identification with resilient
aggregation to mitigate corrupted model updates. Our analysis characterizes how
clustering accuracy, intra-cluster heterogeneity, and adversarial behavior
affect the expected regret of certainty-equivalent (CE) control across LQR
tasks. We establish non-asymptotic bounds demonstrating that the regret
decreases inversely with the number of honest systems per cluster and that this
reduction is preserved under a bounded fraction of adversarial systems within
each cluster.

Abstract: Health prediction is crucial for ensuring reliability, minimizing downtime,
and optimizing maintenance in industrial systems. Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
prediction is a key component of this process; however, many existing models
struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies while dynamically
prioritizing critical features across time for robust prognostics. To address

Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for localized temporal feature extraction with a
modified Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) enhanced by Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder.
This architecture effectively bridges short- and long-term dependencies while
emphasizing salient temporal patterns. Furthermore, the incorporation of a

proposed model reduces the average RMSE by up to 5.5%, underscoring its

Conclusion: SigmaDock是首个在PB训练-测试分割下超越经典基于物理对接的深度学习方法，标志着深度学习在分子建模可靠性和可行性方面的重大突破。

Abstract: Determining the binding pose of a ligand to a protein, known as molecular
docking, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Generative approaches promise
faster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods,
but are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor
generalisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from
structural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building
on this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion
model that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within
the binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock
exploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex
diffusion processes and unstable training dynamics. Experimentally, we show
SigmaDock achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching Top-1 success rates
(RMSD<2 & PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, compared to 12.7-30.8%
reported by recent deep learning approaches, whilst demonstrating consistent
generalisation to unseen proteins. SigmaDock is the first deep learning
approach to surpass classical physics-based docking under the PB train-test
split, marking a significant leap forward in the reliability and feasibility of
deep learning for molecular modelling.

Abstract: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an established treatment for
metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), yet long-term disease control occurs
only in a subset of patients. Predicting progression-free survival (PFS) could
support individualized treatment planning. This study evaluates laboratory,
imaging, and multimodal deep learning models for PFS prediction in PRRT-treated

metastatic NETs undergoing 177Lu-DOTATOC were included. Clinical
characteristics, laboratory values, and pretherapeutic somatostatin receptor
positron emission tomography/computed tomographies (SR-PET/CT) were collected.
Seven models were trained to classify low- vs. high-PFS groups, including
unimodal (laboratory, SR-PET, or CT) and multimodal fusion approaches.
Explainability was evaluated by feature importance analysis and gradient maps.
Forty-two patients (36%) had short PFS (< 1 year), 74 patients long PFS (>1
year). Groups were similar in most characteristics, except for higher baseline
chromogranin A (p = 0.003), elevated gamma-GT (p = 0.002), and fewer PRRT
cycles (p < 0.001) in short-PFS patients. The Random Forest model trained only
on laboratory biomarkers reached an AUROC of 0.59 +- 0.02. Unimodal
three-dimensional convolutional neural networks using SR-PET or CT performed
worse (AUROC 0.42 +- 0.03 and 0.54 +- 0.01, respectively). A multimodal fusion
model laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT -augmented with a pretrained CT branch

Multimodal deep learning combining SR-PET, CT, and laboratory biomarkers

Abstract: Background and Objectives: This paper focuses on using AI to assess the
cognitive function of older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild
dementia using physiological data provided by a wearable device. Cognitive
screening tools are disruptive, time-consuming, and only capture brief
snapshots of activity. Wearable sensors offer an attractive alternative by
continuously monitoring physiological signals. This study investigated whether
physiological data can accurately predict scores on established cognitive
tests. Research Design and Methods: We recorded physiological signals from 23
older adults completing three NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery tests, which assess
working memory, processing speed, and attention. The Empatica EmbracePlus, a
wearable device, measured blood volume pulse, skin conductance, temperature,
and movement. Statistical features were extracted using wavelet-based and
segmentation methods. We then applied supervised learning and validated
predictions via cross-validation, hold-out testing, and bootstrapping. Results:
Our models showed strong performance with Spearman's \rho of 0.73-0.82 and mean
absolute errors of 0.14-0.16, significantly outperforming a naive mean
predictor. Sensor roles varied: heart-related signals combined with movement
and temperature best predicted working memory, movement paired with skin
conductance was most informative for processing speed, and heart in tandem with
skin conductance worked best for attention. Discussion and Implications: These
findings suggest that wearable sensors paired with AI tools such as supervised
learning and feature engineering can noninvasively track specific cognitive
functions in older adults, enabling continuous monitoring. Our study
demonstrates how AI can be leveraged when the data sample is small. This
approach may support remote assessments and facilitate clinical interventions.

Abstract: Large-scale networked services rely on deep soft-ware stacks and microservice

Metadata Storage scheme that keeps only L1 resident and frequently queried
entries on chip while virtualizing bulk metadata into lower levels. We further
add a lightweight Online ML Controller that scores prefetch profitability using
context features and a bandit adjusted threshold. On data center applications,
our approach preserves EIP like speedups with smaller on chip state and
improves efficiency for networked services in the ML era.

problem: epilepsy detection. PRH is a variation of the persistent homology of
digraphs, more traditionally based on the directed flag complex (DPH). A main
advantage of PRH is that it considers the condensations of the digraphs
appearing in the persistent filtration and thus is computed from smaller
digraphs. We compare the effectiveness of PRH to that of DPH and we show that
PRH outperforms DPH in the classification task. We use the Betti curves and
their integrals as topological features and implement our pipeline on support
vector machine.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting carbon prices is essential for informed energy market
decision-making, guiding sustainable energy planning, and supporting effective
decarbonization strategies. However, it remains challenging due to structural
breaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and
market shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches,
have attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and
modeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced
deep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization
capability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid
framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and
PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep
learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot
prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and
policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate
datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing
forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the
state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by
70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without
decomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value
of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep
learning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price
forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.

Abstract: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a major
prodromal marker of $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, often preceding the clinical
onset of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system
atrophy. While wrist-worn actimeters hold significant potential for detecting
RBD in large-scale screening efforts by capturing abnormal nocturnal movements,
they become inoperable without a reliable and efficient analysis pipeline. This
study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool
to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across
heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing
and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract
physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns.
Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong
discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was
confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two
independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To
assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the
internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range
= 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive
features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled
multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By
being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and
facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby
advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model
using wearable devices.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity is important for the
safe and effective implementation of geological carbon storage (GCS) projects.
This paper explores how machine learning methods can enhance data assimilation
for GCS with a framework that integrates score-based diffusion models with
machine learning-enhanced localization in channelized reservoirs during CO$_2$
injection. We employ a machine learning-enhanced localization framework that
uses large ensembles ($N_s = 5000$) with permeabilities generated by the
diffusion model and states computed by simple ML algorithms to improve
covariance estimation for the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation
(ESMDA). We apply ML algorithms to a prior ensemble of channelized permeability
fields, generated with the geostatistical model FLUVSIM. Our approach is
applied on a CO$_2$ injection scenario simulated using the Delft Advanced
Research Terra Simulator (DARTS). Our ML-based localization maintains
significantly more ensemble variance than when localization is not applied,
while achieving comparable data-matching quality. This framework has practical
implications for GCS projects, helping improve the reliability of uncertainty
quantification for risk assessment.

U.S. Building on previous research that examined demand for food products with
supply chain traceability using stated preference analysis, transportation
factors were identified as significant in consumer food purchasing choices.
Consequently, a second experiment was conducted to pinpoint the specific
transportation attributes valued by consumers. A machine learning model was
applied, and five innovative certificates related to transportation were
proposed: Transportation Mode, Internet of Things (IoT), Safety measures,
Energy Source, and Must Arrive By Dates (MABDs). The preference experiment also
incorporated product-specific and decision-maker factors for control purposes.
The findings reveal a notable inclination toward safety and energy certificates
within the transportation domain of the U.S. food supply chain. Additionally,
the study examined the influence of price, product type, certificates, and

Abstract: Precision agriculture demands continuous and accurate monitoring of soil
moisture (M) and key macronutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),
and potassium (K), to optimize yields and conserve resources. Wireless soil
sensing has been explored to measure these four components; however, current
solutions require recalibration (i.e., retraining the data processing model) to
handle variations in soil texture, characterized by aluminosilicates (Al) and
organic carbon (C), limiting their practicality. To address this, we introduce
SoilX, a calibration-free soil sensing system that jointly measures six key
components: {M, N, P, K, C, Al}. By explicitly modeling C and Al, SoilX
eliminates texture- and carbon-dependent recalibration. SoilX incorporates
Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL), with two customized terms: the
Orthogonality Regularizer and the Separation Loss, to effectively disentangle
cross-component interference. Additionally, we design a novel tetrahedral
antenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism, which can robustly measure
soil dielectric permittivity independent of device placement. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SoilX reduces estimation errors by 23.8% to 31.5%
over baselines and generalizes well to unseen fields.

Abstract: Upcoming measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, which
results from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons scattering off moving
electrons, offer a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The kSZ
signal contains key information about the timing, duration, and spatial
structure of the EoR. A precise measurement of the CMB optical depth $\tau$, a
key parameter that characterizes the universe's integrated electron density,
would significantly constrain models of early structure formation. However, the
weak kSZ signal is difficult to extract from CMB observations due to
significant contamination from astrophysical foregrounds. We present a machine
learning approach to extract $\tau$ from simulated kSZ maps. We train advanced
machine learning models, including swin transformers, on high-resolution
seminumeric simulations of the kSZ signal. To robustly quantify prediction
uncertainties of $\tau$, we employ the Laplace Approximation (LA). This
approach provides an efficient and principled Gaussian approximation to the
posterior distribution over the model's weights, allowing for reliable error
estimation. We investigate and compare two distinct application modes: a
post-hoc LA applied to a pre-trained model, and an online LA where model
weights and hyperparameters are optimized jointly by maximizing the marginal
likelihood. This approach provides a framework for robustly constraining $\tau$
and its associated uncertainty, which can enhance the analysis of upcoming CMB
surveys like the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4.

Abstract: Convex clustering is a well-regarded clustering method, resembling the
similar centroid-based approach of Lloyd's $k$-means, without requiring a
predefined cluster count. It starts with each data point as its centroid and
iteratively merges them. Despite its advantages, this method can fail when
dealing with data exhibiting linearly non-separable or non-convex structures.
To mitigate the limitations, we propose a kernelized extension of the convex
clustering method. This approach projects the data points into a Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) using a feature map, enabling convex clustering in
this transformed space. This kernelization not only allows for better handling
of complex data distributions but also produces an embedding in a
finite-dimensional vector space. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
underpinnings for our kernelized approach, proving algorithmic convergence and
establishing finite sample bounds for our estimates. The effectiveness of our
method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets, showing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
clustering techniques. This work marks a significant advancement in the field,
offering an effective solution for clustering in non-linear and non-convex data
scenarios.

challenge in economics. Its relevance has been highlighted in recent years by

hard. We show empirically that it is possible to achieve speed ups of over 3
orders of magnitude when calibrating ABMs of supply networks by running them on
GPUs and using automatic differentiation, compared to non-differentiable
baselines. This opens the door to scaling ABMs to model the whole global supply
network.

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is integral to efficient autoregressive inference in
large language models (LLMs), yet its unbounded growth in stateful multi-turn
scenarios presents major challenges. This paper examines the interplay between
KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like
meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of
positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking
framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the
accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window
(e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory
exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via
AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence.
Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a
cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to
degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving
contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial "gist") can yield more
coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate
for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional
structure, and view "cache health" holistically beyond mere size.

Abstract: SDE-based methods such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have shown remarkable success in real-world sample generation tasks. Prior
analyses of DDPMs have been focused on the exponential Euler discretization,
showing guarantees that generally depend at least linearly on the dimension or
initial Fisher information. Inspired by works in log-concave sampling (Shen and
Lee, 2019), we analyze an integrator -- the denoising diffusion randomized
midpoint method (DDRaM) -- that leverages an additional randomized midpoint to
better approximate the SDE. Using a recently-developed analytic framework
called the "shifted composition rule", we show that this algorithm enjoys
favorable discretization properties under appropriate smoothness assumptions,
with sublinear $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ score evaluations needed to ensure
convergence. This is the first sublinear complexity bound for pure DDPM
sampling -- prior works which obtained such bounds worked instead with
ODE-based sampling and had to make modifications to the sampler which deviate
from how they are used in practice. We also provide experimental validation of
the advantages of our method, showing that it performs well in practice with
pre-trained image synthesis models.

Abstract: The ROC-SVM, originally proposed by Rakotomamonjy, directly maximizes the
area under the ROC curve (AUC) and has become an attractive alternative of the
conventional binary classification under the presence of class imbalance.
However, its practical use is limited by high computational cost, as training
involves evaluating all $O(n^2)$. To overcome this limitation, we develop a
scalable variant of the ROC-SVM that leverages incomplete U-statistics, thereby
substantially reducing computational complexity. We further extend the
framework to nonlinear classification through a low-rank kernel approximation,
enabling efficient training in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Theoretical
analysis establishes an error bound that justifies the proposed approximation,
and empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves comparable AUC performance to the original ROC-SVM
with drastically reduced training time.
