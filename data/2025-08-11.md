Motivation: LLMs在内容生成和理解方面具有革命性能力，但也可能产生有害内容，因此需要系统研究其安全性和伦理对齐。

Method: 系统综述了近期研究，包括无意毒性、对抗性攻击和内容审核技术，提出了统一的分类法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized content creation across
digital platforms, offering unprecedented capabilities in natural language
generation and understanding. These models enable beneficial applications such
as content generation, question and answering (Q&A), programming, and code
reasoning. Meanwhile, they also pose serious risks by inadvertently or
intentionally producing toxic, offensive, or biased content. This dual role of
LLMs, both as powerful tools for solving real-world problems and as potential
sources of harmful language, presents a pressing sociotechnical challenge. In
this survey, we systematically review recent studies spanning unintentional
toxicity, adversarial jailbreaking attacks, and content moderation techniques.
We propose a unified taxonomy of LLM-related harms and defenses, analyze
emerging multimodal and LLM-assisted jailbreak strategies, and assess
mitigation efforts, including reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF), prompt engineering, and safety alignment. Our synthesis highlights the
evolving landscape of LLM safety, identifies limitations in current evaluation
methodologies, and outlines future research directions to guide the development
of robust and ethically aligned language technologies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Temporal Self-Rewarding Language Models的新架构，通过协调过去、现在和未来的模型输出来解决现有自奖励范式中学习信号逐渐减弱的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自奖励范式在同步改进选择和拒绝样本时，导致对比样本的表示差异逐渐缩小，从而削弱了偏好学习的有效性。

Method: 提出双阶段框架：(1) Anchored Rejection固定拒绝样本；(2) Future-Guided Chosen动态选择样本。

Result: 在多个模型家族和规模上实验表明，该方法显著优于基线，例如Llama3.1-8B在AlpacaEval 2.0上胜率提升9.75。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了性能，还展现出卓越的跨任务泛化能力。

Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models propose an architecture in which the Large
Language Models(LLMs) both generates responses and evaluates its own outputs
via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting, dynamically improving its generative capabilities
through iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, our analysis
reveals a critical limitation in existing Self-Rewarding paradigms: the
synchronized improvement of chosen and rejected responses progressively narrows
the representational difference between contrasting samples, undermining
effective preference learning. We propose \textbf{Temporal Self-Rewarding
Language Models} that strategically coordinate past, present, and future model
generations to sustain learning signals. Our dual-phase framework introduces:
(1) \textit{Anchored Rejection} - fixing rejected responses using the past
initial model's outputs and (2) \textit{Future-Guided Chosen} - dynamically
curating chosen samples using next-generation model predictions. Extensive
experiments across three model families (Llama, Qwen, Mistral) and different
model sizes (Llama3B/8B/70B) demonstrate significant improvements when trained
with our method compared to Self-Rewarding using same computation resources.
For example, Llama3.1-8B reaches a 29.44 win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 with our
method, outperforming the Self-Rewarding baseline (19.69) by 9.75. Notably, our
method also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization across
mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), knowledge-based QA (ARC, TruthfulQA), and code
generation (HumanEval) tasks, even though we do not specifically collect such
training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中RAG和RLVR能力孤立发展，限制了泛化性和应用范围。UR2旨在通过统一框架解决这一问题。

Result: 实验表明UR2在多个任务中显著优于现有方法，性能接近GPT-4o-mini和GPT-4.1-mini。

Conclusion: UR2为RAG与RL的统一提供了通用框架，提升了任务适应性和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two
complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances
knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR),
which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities
are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain
narrow in scope-typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval
settings and task-specific assumptions. This lack of integration constrains
generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader
domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a
general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement
learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum
training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and
a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora
with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic
coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a
diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical,
and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR2 (built on Qwen2.5-3/7B
and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods,
achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several
benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce hallucinations - factually
incorrect or fabricated information - which poses significant challenges for
many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as dialogue systems.
As a result, detecting hallucinations has become a critical area of research.
Current approaches to hallucination detection in dialogue systems primarily
focus on verifying the factual consistency of generated responses. However,
these responses often contain a mix of accurate, inaccurate or unverifiable
facts, making one factual label overly simplistic and coarse-grained. In this
paper, we introduce a benchmark, FineDialFact, for fine-grained dialogue fact
verification, which involves verifying atomic facts extracted from dialogue
responses. To support this, we construct a dataset based on publicly available
dialogue datasets and evaluate it using various baseline methods. Experimental
results demonstrate that methods incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
can enhance performance in dialogue fact verification. Despite this, the best
F1-score achieved on the HybriDialogue, an open-domain dialogue dataset, is
only 0.75, indicating that the benchmark remains a challenging task for future
research. Our dataset and code will be public on GitHub.

Result: 在五个QA基准测试和四种开源LLM上的实验显示，SPS能提升任务性能并揭示检索与生成的交互机制。

Conclusion: SPS为检索增强生成提供了新的评估视角，xCompress框架展示了动态处理检索摘要的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown improved generation performance
through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) following the retriever-reader
paradigm, which supplements model inputs with externally retrieved knowledge.
However, prior work often evaluates RAG holistically, assessing the retriever
and reader jointly, making it difficult to isolate the true contribution of
retrieval, particularly given the prompt sensitivity of LLMs used as readers.
We introduce Spectrum Projection Score (SPS), a lightweight, supervision-free
metric that allows the reader to gauge the semantic alignment of a retrieved
summary with its hidden representation by comparing the area formed by
generated tokens from the summary, and the principal directions of subspace in
the reader and to measure the relevance. Building on SPS we present xCompress,
an inference time controller framework that dynamically samples, ranks, and
compresses retrieval summary candidates. Extensive experiments on five QA
benchmarks with four open source LLMs show that SPS not only enhances
performance across a range of tasks but also provides a principled perspective
on the interaction between retrieval and generation.

Method: 方法是在DistilBERT模型的微调过程中引入结构化、后验稀疏性，并在SST-2情感分析任务上进行验证。

Result: 结果显示，80%稀疏度的模型验证精度达到91.59%，比密集基线提高了0.97%。

Conclusion: 结论是注意力稀疏性不仅是一种计算效率工具，还能通过隐式正则化提升模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: The quadratic computational cost of the self-attention mechanism is a primary
challenge in scaling Transformer models. While attention sparsity is widely
studied as a technique to improve computational efficiency, it is almost
universally assumed to come at the cost of model accuracy. In this paper, we
report a surprising counter-example to this common wisdom. By introducing
structured, post-hoc sparsity to the attention mechanism of a DistilBERT model
during fine-tuning on the SST-2 sentiment analysis task, we find that model
accuracy improves significantly. Our model with 80\% attention sparsity
achieves a validation accuracy of 91.59\%, a 0.97\% absolute improvement over
the dense baseline. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is due to sparsity
acting as a powerful implicit regularizer, preventing the model from
overfitting by forcing it to make predictions with a more constrained and
robust set of features. Our work recasts attention sparsity not just as a tool
for computational efficiency, but as a potential method for improving the
generalization and performance of Transformer models.

Result: 在3个数据集、4种LLM和7种嵌入模型上验证，准确率高达90%。句子嵌入模型优于图嵌入模型。

Conclusion: PEEK可大规模识别LLM的知识盲点，并揭示其内部归纳偏差。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge across diverse domains such as
science, history, and geography encountered during generative pre-training.
However, due to their stochasticity, it is difficult to predict what LLMs have
acquired. Prior work has developed different ways to probe this knowledge by
investigating the hidden representations, crafting specific task prompts,
curating representative samples, and estimating their uncertainty. However,
these methods require making forward passes through the underlying model to
probe the LLM's knowledge about a specific fact, making them computationally
expensive and time-consuming. To bridge this gap, we propose $\textbf{PEEK}$ or
$\textbf{P}$roxy $\textbf{E}$mbeddings to $\textbf{E}$stimate
$\textbf{K}$nowledge of LLMs, by leveraging the pre-trained embedding models
that effectively encode factual knowledge as text or graphs as proxies for
LLMs. First, we identify a training set of facts known by LLMs through various
probing strategies and then adapt embedding models to predict the LLM outputs
with a linear decoder layer. Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived
datasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict
LLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy. Furthermore, we find
that sentence embedding models are more suitable than graph embeddings to
predict LLM knowledge, shedding light on the underlying representation of the
factual landscape. Thus, we believe that knowledge-adapted embeddings can be
used to identify knowledge gaps in LLMs at scale and can provide deeper
insights into LLMs' internal inductive bias. The code and data are made

Conclusion: EvolvR框架通过自我进化方法显著提升了LLM在故事评估中的表现，并验证了其作为奖励模型的有效性。

Abstract: Although the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges
(LLM-as-a-judge) has been validated, their performance remains limited in
open-ended tasks, particularly in story evaluation. Accurate story evaluation
is crucial not only for assisting human quality judgment but also for providing
key signals to guide story generation. However, existing methods face a
dilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor
adaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the
rigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation. To address
this, we propose the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework.
Grounded in pairwise comparison, the framework first self-synthesizes
score-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data via a multi-persona strategy. To
ensure data quality, these raw CoTs undergo a self-filtering process, utilizing
multi-agents to guarantee their logical rigor and robustness. Finally, the
evaluator trained on the refined data is deployed as a reward model to guide
the story generation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three evaluation benchmarks
including StoryER, HANNA and OpenMEVA. Furthermore, when served as a reward
model, it significantly enhances the quality of generated stories, thereby
fully validating the superiority of our self-evolving approach.

Result: 实验表明LogicRAG在性能和效率上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: LogicRAG为LLM的检索增强生成提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination, generating
factually incorrect statements when handling questions beyond their knowledge
and perception. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by
retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM
reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the
relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable
performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG)
methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph,
introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world
queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for
accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required
structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we
propose a \textbf{\underline{Logic}}-aware
\textbf{\underline{R}}etrieval-\textbf{\underline{A}}ugmented
\textbf{\underline{G}}eneration framework (\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically
extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval
without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query
into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to
model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step
reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that
subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG
applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to
filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior
performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: AURA为更安全、负责任的AI设定了新基准。

Abstract: Present day LLMs face the challenge of managing affordance-based safety
risks-situations where outputs inadvertently facilitate harmful actions due to
overlooked logical implications. Traditional safety solutions, such as scalar
outcome-based reward models, parameter tuning, or heuristic decoding
strategies, lack the granularity and proactive nature needed to reliably detect
and intervene during subtle yet crucial reasoning steps. Addressing this
fundamental gap, we introduce AURA, an innovative, multi-layered framework
centered around Process Reward Models (PRMs), providing comprehensive, step
level evaluations across logical coherence and safety-awareness. Our framework
seamlessly combines introspective self-critique, fine-grained PRM assessments,
and adaptive safety-aware decoding to dynamically and proactively guide models
toward safer reasoning trajectories. Empirical evidence clearly demonstrates
that this approach significantly surpasses existing methods, significantly
improving the logical integrity and affordance-sensitive safety of model
outputs. This research represents a pivotal step toward safer, more
responsible, and contextually aware AI, setting a new benchmark for
alignment-sensitive applications.

Conclusion: 数据质量和兼容性是LLM蒸馏的关键，SRD为此提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a fundamental technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) into compact, efficient student models. However,
existing white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and
student-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training
data quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we
propose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation
framework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically
refine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response
pairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively
curating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated
ranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a
curriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these
curated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a
plug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes
across diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as
decreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a
range of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in
distilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up
to 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a
plug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying
KD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are
pivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a
principled framework to achieve both. This work advances the understanding of
data-centric factors in KD and offers practical insights for enhancing the
capability and efficiency of compressed LLMs.

representation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias
features from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention
weight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social
attribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is
formed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the
StereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including
gender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key
metrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual
sensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong
detection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify
bias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high
semantic alignment and output stability. The method also demonstrates high
interpretability in its structural design. It helps uncover the internal bias
association mechanisms within language models. This provides a more transparent
and reliable technical foundation for bias detection. The approach is suitable
for real-world applications where high trustworthiness of generated content is
required.

Motivation: 现有模型合并方法采用统一的稀疏率，忽略了参数的结构和统计异质性，导致性能不佳。TADrop旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TADrop根据参数张量的分布特性动态调整稀疏率，密集冗余的张量被大幅修剪，稀疏关键的张量被保留。

Result: 实验表明，TADrop显著提升了多种任务（视觉、语言、多模态）和模型（ViT、BEiT）的性能，平均提升2.0%。

Conclusion: TADrop通过自适应稀疏化优化了模型合并，为高性能合并提供了新基准。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a compelling data-free paradigm for multi-task
learning, enabling the fusion of multiple fine-tuned models into a single,
powerful entity. A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which
prunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.
However, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,
applying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and
statistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal
trade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful
ones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{TADrop}
(\textbf{T}ensor-wise \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{Drop}), an adaptive
sparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global
ratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based
on its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with
denser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,
more critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we
validate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging
methods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and
multimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and
significantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading
merging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\% across 8
ViT-B/32 tasks. TADrop provides a more effective way to mitigate parameter
interference by tailoring sparsification to the model's structure, offering a
new baseline for high-performance model merging.

Conclusion: 模型能通过生成合成数据自我改进，为小数据下高效知识注入提供路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often require vast amounts of text to
effectively acquire new knowledge. While continuing pre-training on large
corpora or employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven
successful, updating an LLM with only a few thousand or million tokens remains
challenging. In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small,
unstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic
forgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap
with the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by
probing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information.
Starting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different
augmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge
acquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing
pre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the
model to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new
facts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through
diverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in
small-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new
content and retaining existing capabilities. We also confirm the sensitivity of
RAG-based approaches for knowledge injection, which often lead to greater
degradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods. Finally, we
demonstrate that models can generate effective synthetic training data
themselves, suggesting a pathway toward self-improving model updates. All code
and generated data used in our experiments are publicly available, providing a

Abstract: Precise jailbreak evaluation is vital for LLM red teaming and jailbreak
research. Current approaches employ binary classification ( e.g., string
matching, toxic text classifiers, LLM-driven methods), yielding only "yes/no"
labels without quantifying harm intensity. Existing multi-dimensional
frameworks ( e.g., Security Violation, Relative Truthfulness, Informativeness)
apply uniform evaluation criteria across scenarios, resulting in
scenario-specific mismatches--for instance, "Relative Truthfulness" is
irrelevant to "hate speech"--which compromise evaluation precision. To tackle
these limitations, we introduce SceneJailEval, with key contributions: (1) A
groundbreaking scenario-adaptive multi-dimensional framework for jailbreak
evaluation, overcoming the critical "one-size-fits-all" constraint of existing
multi-dimensional methods, and featuring strong extensibility to flexibly adapt
to customized or emerging scenarios. (2) A comprehensive 14-scenario dataset
with diverse jailbreak variants and regional cases, filling the long-standing
gap in high-quality, holistic benchmarks for scenario-adaptive evaluation. (3)
SceneJailEval achieves state-of-the-art results, with an F1 score of 0.917 on
our full-scenario dataset (+6% over prior SOTA) and 0.995 on JBB (+3% over
prior SOTA), surpassing accuracy limits of existing evaluation methods in

Conclusion: MDIR是一种高效、准确的LLM抄袭检测方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In recent years, concerns about intellectual property (IP) in large language
models (LLMs) have grown significantly. Plagiarizing other LLMs (through direct
weight copying, upcycling, pruning, or continual pretraining) and claiming
authorship without properly attributing to the original license, is a serious
misconduct that can lead to significant financial and reputational harm to the
original developers. However, existing methods for detecting LLM plagiarism
fall short in key areas. They fail to accurately reconstruct weight
correspondences, lack the ability to compute statistical significance measures
such as $p$-values, and may mistakenly flag models trained on similar data as
being related. To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant
Review (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large
Deviation Theory. MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight
relationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively
on weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental
results demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive
transformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with
trillions of tokens. Moreover, all detections can be performed on a single PC
within an hour, making MDIR both efficient and accessible.

Conclusion: SecMCP有效解决了MCP的安全威胁，提供了新的量化方法。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external tools, enabling dynamic aggregation of real-time data to
improve task execution. However, its non-isolated execution context introduces
critical security and privacy risks. In particular, adversarially crafted
content can induce tool poisoning or indirect prompt injection, leading to
conversation hijacking, misinformation propagation, or data exfiltration.
Existing defenses, such as rule-based filters or LLM-driven detection, remain
inadequate due to their reliance on static signatures, computational
inefficiency, and inability to quantify conversational hijacking. To address
these limitations, we propose SecMCP, a secure framework that detects and
quantifies conversation drift, deviations in latent space trajectories induced
by adversarial external knowledge. By modeling LLM activation vectors within a
latent polytope space, SecMCP identifies anomalous shifts in conversational
dynamics, enabling proactive detection of hijacking, misleading, and data
exfiltration. We evaluate SecMCP on three state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama3,
Vicuna, Mistral) across benchmark datasets (MS MARCO, HotpotQA, FinQA),
demonstrating robust detection with AUROC scores exceeding 0.915 while
maintaining system usability. Our contributions include a systematic
categorization of MCP security threats, a novel latent polytope-based
methodology for quantifying conversation drift, and empirical validation of
SecMCP's efficacy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they
suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled
in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents
with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp
that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step
instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact
of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory.
Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and
deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new
experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as
the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates
and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built
from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a
weaker model yields substantial performance gains.

Motivation: Explore whether knowledge from fine-tuning in few languages transfers to unseen languages, and if minimal fine-tuning can correct pre-training biases.

Method: Fine-tune lightweight LLaMA models on monolingual, bilingual, or multilingual datasets to classify immigration tweets across 13 languages. Evaluate cross-lingual topic detection and bias correction.

Result: LLMs fine-tuned in 1-2 languages classify unseen languages well; multilingual fine-tuning improves stance detection. Minimal exposure to underrepresented languages reduces bias. Lightweight models are cost-effective.

Conclusion: Limited language coverage suffices for topic generalization; lightweight interventions correct biases. Open-source models enable scalable, inclusive research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming social-science research by
enabling scalable, precise analysis. Their adaptability raises the question of
whether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer
to unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we
fine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or
multilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter
across 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific
discourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables
cross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects
pre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages
can reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,
identifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance
benefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant
languages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during
fine-tuning (as little as $9.62\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training
token volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption
that cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited
language coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural
biases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing
4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source,
reproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster
inference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model,

Conclusion: SlimInfer在不牺牲性能的情况下显著提升LLM推理效率。

Abstract: Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by
high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention
computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer,
limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative
framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical
prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information
diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through
layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion
process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive
tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.
Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning
mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at
intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous
KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex
predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments
show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token
(TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on
LongBench. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Human memory is fleeting. As words are processed, the exact wordforms that
make up incoming sentences are rapidly lost. Cognitive scientists have long
believed that this limitation of memory may, paradoxically, help in learning
language - an idea supported by classic connectionist modelling work. The rise
of Transformers appears to challenge this idea, as these models can learn
language effectively, despite lacking memory limitations or other architectural
recency biases. Here, we investigate the hypothesized benefit of fleeting
memory for language learning in tightly controlled experiments on transformer
language models. Training transformers with and without fleeting memory on a
developmentally realistic training set, we find that fleeting memory
consistently improves language learning (as quantified by both overall language
modelling performance and targeted syntactic evaluation) but, unexpectedly,
impairs surprisal-based prediction of human reading times. Interestingly,
follow up analyses revealed that this discrepancy - better language modeling,
yet worse reading time prediction - could not be accounted for by prior
explanations of why better language models sometimes fit human reading time
worse. Together, these results support a benefit of memory limitations on
neural network language learning - but not on predicting behavior.

Abstract: A growing number of studies show near-perfect LLM language-based prediction
of depression assessment scores (up to R2 of .70). However, many develop these
models directly from language responses to depression assessments. These
"Mirror models" suffer from "criterion contamination", which arises when a
predicted score depends in part on the predictors themselves. This causes
artificial effect size inflation which reduces model generalizability. The
present study compares the performance of Mirror models versus "Non-Mirror
models", which are developed from language that does not mirror the assessment
they are developed to predict. N = 110 research participants completed two
different interviews: structured diagnostic and life history interviews. GPT-4,
GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B were then prompted to predict structured diagnostic
interview depression scores from the two transcripts separately. Mirror models
(using structured diagnostic data) showed very large effect sizes (e.g., R2 =
.80). As expected, NonMirror models (using life history data) demonstrated
smaller effect sizes, but were relatively large (e.g., R2 = .27). When Mirror
and Non-Mirror model-predicted structured interview depression scores were
correlated with self-reported depression symptoms, Mirror and NonMirror
performed the same (e.g., r = ~.54), indicating that Mirror models contain bias
perhaps due to criterion contamination. Topic modeling identified clusters
across Mirror and Non-Mirror models, as well as between true-positive and
false-positive predictions. In this head-to-head comparison study, Mirror
language AI models of depression showed artificially inflated effect sizes and
less generalizability. As language AI models for depression continue to evolve,
incorporating Non-Mirror models may identify interpretable, and generalizable
semantic features that have unique utility in real-world psychological
assessment.

Abstract: The paper reconceptualizes pragmatics not as a subordinate, third dimension
of meaning, but as a dynamic interface through which language operates as a
socially embedded tool for action. With the emergence of large language models
(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further
refined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the
traditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures
destabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine
Communication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second
section examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the
machine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics
continue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to
predictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the
Rational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing
on optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the
issue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and
communicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM
evaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the
paper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of
increased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,
emphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both
for the model and themselves. These arguments suggest that pragmatic theory may
need to be adjusted or expanded to better account for communication involving
generative AI.

Motivation: 解决AI驱动的编码系统因其不透明的决策过程而引发的信任和可用性问题，特别是对非专家用户。

Method: 提出神经符号方法，通过符号约束指导模型行为，并在推理时通过神经表示丰富程序语义，实现自动一致性检查。

Result: 现有方法（如形式验证、静态分析和事后解释）在认知对齐和语义忠实性方面存在局限。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法有望生成更符合用户理解的合理性解释，提升智能编码系统的信任度。

Abstract: Intelligent coding systems are transforming software development by enabling
users to specify code behavior in natural language. However, the opaque
decision-making of AI-driven coders raises trust and usability concerns,
particularly for non-expert users who cannot inspect low-level implementations.
We argue that these systems should not only generate code but also produce
clear, consistent justifications that bridge model reasoning and user
understanding. To this end, we identify two critical justification
properties-cognitive alignment and semantic faithfulness-and highlight the
limitations of existing methods, including formal verification, static
analysis, and post-hoc explainability. We advocate exploring neuro-symbolic
approaches for justification generation, where symbolic constraints guide model
behavior during training and program semantics are enriched through neural
representations, enabling automated consistency checks at inference time.

Conclusion: Fact2Fiction揭示了当前事实核查系统的安全弱点，呼吁开发防御措施。

Abstract: State-of-the-art fact-checking systems combat misinformation at scale by
employing autonomous LLM-based agents to decompose complex claims into smaller
sub-claims, verify each sub-claim individually, and aggregate the partial
results to produce verdicts with justifications (explanatory rationales for the
verdicts). The security of these systems is crucial, as compromised
fact-checkers, which tend to be easily underexplored, can amplify
misinformation. This work introduces Fact2Fiction, the first poisoning attack
framework targeting such agentic fact-checking systems. Fact2Fiction mirrors
the decomposition strategy and exploits system-generated justifications to
craft tailored malicious evidences that compromise sub-claim verification.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fact2Fiction achieves 8.9\%--21.2\%
higher attack success rates than state-of-the-art attacks across various
poisoning budgets. Fact2Fiction exposes security weaknesses in current
fact-checking systems and highlights the need for defensive countermeasures.

Abstract: Affective Computing has been established as a crucial field of inquiry to
advance the holistic development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.
Foundation models -- especially Large Language Models (LLMs) -- have been
evaluated, trained, or instruction-tuned in several past works, to become
better predictors or generators of emotion. Most of these studies, however,
approach emotion-related tasks in a supervised manner, assessing or training
the capabilities of LLMs using discrete emotion labels associated with stimuli
(e.g., text, images, video, audio). Evaluation studies, in particular, have
often been limited to standard and superficial emotion-related tasks, such as
the recognition of evoked or expressed emotions. In this paper, we move beyond
surface-level emotion tasks to investigate how LLMs reason about emotions
through cognitive dimensions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal theory, we
examine whether LLMs produce coherent and plausible cognitive reasoning when
reasoning about emotionally charged stimuli. We introduce a large-scale
benchmark on Cognitive Reasoning for Emotions - CoRE - to evaluate internal
cognitive structures implicitly used by LLMs for emotional reasoning. Through a
plethora of evaluation experiments and analysis, we seek to answer: (a) Are
models more likely to implicitly rely on specific cognitive appraisal
dimensions?, (b) What cognitive dimensions are important for characterizing
specific emotions?, and, (c) Can the internal representations of different
emotion categories in LLMs be interpreted through cognitive appraisal
dimensions? Our results and analyses reveal diverse reasoning patterns across
different LLMs. Our benchmark and code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: DKG-LLM是一个可靠且具有变革性的工具，能够处理噪声数据和复杂多症状疾病，并通过医生反馈进行学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown exponentially since the release of
ChatGPT. These models have gained attention due to their robust performance on
various tasks, including language processing tasks. These models achieve
understanding and comprehension of tasks by training billions of parameters.
The development of these models is a transformative force in enhancing natural
language understanding and has taken a significant step towards artificial
general intelligence (AGI). In this study, we aim to present the DKG-LLM
framework. The DKG-LLM framework introduces a groundbreaking approach to
medical diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations by integrating a
dynamic knowledge graph (DKG) with the Grok 3 large language model. Using the
Adaptive Semantic Fusion Algorithm (ASFA), heterogeneous medical data
(including clinical reports and PubMed articles) and patient records
dynamically generate a knowledge graph consisting of 15,964 nodes in 13
distinct types (e.g., diseases, symptoms, treatments, patient profiles) and
127,392 edges in 26 relationship types (e.g., causal, therapeutic,
association). ASFA utilizes advanced probabilistic models, Bayesian inference,
and graph optimization to extract semantic information, dynamically updating
the graph with approximately 150 new nodes and edges in each data category
while maintaining scalability with up to 987,654 edges. Real-world datasets,
including MIMIC-III and PubMed, were utilized to evaluate the proposed
architecture. The evaluation results show that DKG-LLM achieves a diagnostic
accuracy of 84.19%. The model also has a treatment recommendation accuracy of
89.63% and a semantic coverage of 93.48%. DKG-LLM is a reliable and
transformative tool that handles noisy data and complex multi-symptom diseases,
along with feedback-based learning from physician input.

Abstract: Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a critical yet underexplored dimension in the
development of human-aligned LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce a unified,
psychologically grounded four-layer taxonomy of EI tailored for large language
models (LLMs), encompassing emotional tracking, cause inference, appraisal, and
emotionally appropriate response generation. Building on this framework, we
present EICAP-Bench, a novel MCQ style multi-turn benchmark designed to
evaluate EI capabilities in open-source LLMs across diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts. We evaluate six LLMs: LLaMA3 (8B), LLaMA3-Instruct, Gemma
(9B), Gemma-Instruct, Qwen2.5 (7B), and Qwen2.5-Instruct on EmoCap-Bench,
identifying Qwen2.5-Instruct as the strongest baseline. To assess the potential
for enhancing EI capabilities, we fine-tune both Qwen2.5-Base and
Qwen2.5-Instruct using LoRA adapters on UltraChat (UC), a large-scale,
instruction-tuned dialogue dataset, in both English and Arabic. Our statistical
analysis reveals that among the five EI layers, only the Appraisal layer shows
significant improvement through UC-based fine-tuning. These findings highlight
the limitations of existing pretraining and instruction-tuning paradigms in
equipping LLMs with deeper emotional reasoning and underscore the need for
targeted data and modeling strategies for comprehensive EI alignment.

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）技术，构建Contextual Policy Engine（CPE），动态检索政策知识并生成分类结果。

Result: 实验表明CPE在分类准确性、可解释性和动态更新方面表现优异，无需重新训练即可适应政策变化。

Conclusion: RAG方法为内容审核等分类任务提供了更灵活、透明和可适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Robust content moderation requires classification systems that can quickly
adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification
using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional
classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with
pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual
knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the
task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?"
  Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates
this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification
accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability
via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model
retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline
performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by
correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring
retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that
RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and
adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
role-playing conversations and providing emotional support as separate research
directions. However, there remains a significant research gap in combining
these capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual
characters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a
case study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases.
This choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide
emotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce
ChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We
first thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities
and design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a
nationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with
profound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in
role-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from
10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP
performance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system
featuring 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,
role-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response
diversity. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000
LLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations.
Experimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in
role-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response
diversity. We hope this work can provide valuable resources and insights for
future research on optimizing LLMs in ESRP. Our datasets are available at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing by
leveraging audio codecs to discretize audio into tokens, enabling the
application of language modeling techniques to speech data. However, existing
audio codecs often operate at high frame rates, leading to slow training and
inference, particularly for autoregressive models. To address this, there is
growing interest in low frame-rate audio codecs, which reduce the number of
autoregressive steps required to generate one second of audio. In this paper,
we conduct ablation studies to examine the impact of frame rate, bitrate, and
causality on codec reconstruction quality. Based on our findings, we introduce
NanoCodec, a state-of-the-art audio codec that achieves high-quality
compression at just 12.5 frames per second (FPS). NanoCodec outperforms related
works across various bitrate ranges, establishing a new benchmark for
low-latency and efficient Speech LLM training and inference.

Abstract: Detecting cyberbullying on social media remains a critical challenge due to
its subtle and varied expressions. This study investigates whether integrating
aggression detection as an auxiliary task within a unified training framework
can enhance the generalisation and performance of large language models (LLMs)
in cyberbullying detection. Experiments are conducted on five aggression
datasets and one cyberbullying dataset using instruction-tuned LLMs. We
evaluated multiple strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, independent LoRA
fine-tuning, and multi-task learning (MTL). Given the inconsistent results of
MTL, we propose an enriched prompt pipeline approach in which aggression
predictions are embedded into cyberbullying detection prompts to provide
contextual augmentation. Preliminary results show that the enriched prompt
pipeline consistently outperforms standard LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that
aggression-informed context significantly boosts cyberbullying detection. This
study highlights the potential of auxiliary tasks, such as aggression
detection, to improve the generalisation of LLMs for safety-critical
applications on social networks.

Abstract: Detecting prosociality in text--communication intended to affirm, support, or
improve others' behavior--is a novel and increasingly important challenge for
trust and safety systems. Unlike toxic content detection, prosociality lacks
well-established definitions and labeled data, requiring new approaches to both
annotation and deployment. We present a practical, three-stage pipeline that
enables scalable, high-precision prosocial content classification while
minimizing human labeling effort and inference costs. First, we identify the
best LLM-based labeling strategy using a small seed set of human-labeled
examples. We then introduce a human-AI refinement loop, where annotators review
high-disagreement cases between GPT-4 and humans to iteratively clarify and
expand the task definition-a critical step for emerging annotation tasks like
prosociality. This process results in improved label quality and definition
alignment. Finally, we synthesize 10k high-quality labels using GPT-4 and train
a two-stage inference system: a lightweight classifier handles high-confidence
predictions, while only $\sim$35\% of ambiguous instances are escalated to
GPT-4o. This architecture reduces inference costs by $\sim$70% while achieving
high precision ($\sim$0.90). Our pipeline demonstrates how targeted human-AI
interaction, careful task formulation, and deployment-aware architecture design
can unlock scalable solutions for novel responsible AI tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive

causal inference -- a core aspect of human cognition -- remains underexplored,
particularly in multimodal settings. In this study, we introduce InfoCausalQA,
a novel benchmark designed to evaluate causal reasoning grounded in
infographics that combine structured visual data with textual context. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: Task 1 focuses on quantitative causal reasoning
based on inferred numerical trends, while Task 2 targets semantic causal
reasoning involving five types of causal relations: cause, effect,
intervention, counterfactual, and temporal. We manually collected 494
infographic-text pairs from four public sources and used GPT-4o to generate
1,482 high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs. These questions were then
carefully revised by humans to ensure they cannot be answered based on
surface-level cues alone but instead require genuine visual grounding. Our
experimental results reveal that current VLMs exhibit limited capability in
computational reasoning and even more pronounced limitations in semantic causal
reasoning. Their significantly lower performance compared to humans indicates a
substantial gap in leveraging infographic-based information for causal
inference. Through InfoCausalQA, we highlight the need for advancing the causal
reasoning abilities of multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Intent recognition (IR) for speech commands is essential for artificial

limited to short commands and are predominantly developed for English. This
paper addresses these limitations by focusing on IR from speech by elderly
German speakers. We propose a novel approach that combines an adapted Whisper
ASR model, fine-tuned on elderly German speech (SVC-de), with Transformer-based
language models trained on synthetic text datasets generated by three
well-known large language models (LLMs): LeoLM, Llama3, and ChatGPT. To
evaluate the robustness of our approach, we generate synthetic speech with a
text-to-speech model and conduct extensive cross-dataset testing. Our results
show that synthetic LLM-generated data significantly boosts classification
performance and robustness to different speaking styles and unseen vocabulary.
Notably, we find that LeoLM, a smaller, domain-specific 13B LLM, surpasses the
much larger ChatGPT (175B) in dataset quality for German intent recognition.
Our approach demonstrates that generative AI can effectively bridge data gaps
in low-resource domains. We provide detailed documentation of our data
generation and training process to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown generalized zero-shot capabilities
in diverse domain question-answering (QA) tasks, including graph QA that
involves complex graph topologies. However, most current approaches use only a
single type of graph representation, namely Topology Representation Form (TRF),
such as prompt-unified text descriptions or style-fixed visual styles. Those
"one-size-fits-all" approaches fail to consider the specific preferences of
different models or tasks, often leading to incorrect or overly long responses.
To address this, we first analyze the characteristics and weaknesses of
existing TRFs, and then design a set of TRFs, denoted by $F_{ZS}$, tailored to
zero-shot graph QA. We then introduce a new metric, Graph Response Efficiency
(GRE), which measures the balance between the performance and the brevity in
graph QA. Built on these, we develop the DynamicTRF framework, which aims to
improve both the accuracy and conciseness of graph QA. To be specific,
DynamicTRF first creates a TRF Preference (TRFP) dataset that ranks TRFs based
on their GRE scores, to probe the question-specific TRF preferences. Then it
trains a TRF router on the TRFP dataset, to adaptively assign the best TRF from
$F_{ZS}$ for each question during the inference. Extensive experiments across 7
in-domain algorithmic graph QA tasks and 2 out-of-domain downstream tasks show
that DynamicTRF significantly enhances the zero-shot graph QA of LMMs in terms

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过深度神经网络代理的涌现通信揭示人类语言的本质，但现有研究局限于特定子领域目标和指标。

Method: 重新设计属性值重建游戏，引入小词汇约束和屈折形态模拟，开发新指标并探索游戏变体。

Result: 实验发现模拟音系约束促进连接性形态，涌现语言倾向于融合语法属性。

Conclusion: 研究为涌现通信与自然语言比较提供了新视角，揭示了模拟约束对语言形态的影响。

Abstract: Emergent communication (EmCom) with deep neural network-based agents promises
to yield insights into the nature of human language, but remains focused
primarily on a few subfield-specific goals and metrics that prioritize
communication schemes which represent attributes with unique characters
one-to-one and compose them syntactically. We thus reinterpret a common EmCom
setting, the attribute-value reconstruction game, by imposing a
small-vocabulary constraint to simulate double articulation, and formulating a
novel setting analogous to naturalistic inflectional morphology (enabling
meaningful comparison to natural language communication schemes). We develop
new metrics and explore variations of this game motivated by real properties of
inflectional morphology: concatenativity and fusionality. Through our
experiments, we discover that simulated phonological constraints encourage
concatenative morphology, and emergent languages replicate the tendency of
natural languages to fuse grammatical attributes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ATOP的新方法，通过联合学习主题共享和主题特定特征，改进跨主题自动作文评分（AES）。该方法利用对抗训练和邻居分类器优化提示调整，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨主题AES方法主要关注主题共享特征，忽略了主题特定特征，导致评估关键特质（如主题一致性）的能力受限。ATOP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ATOP通过优化可学习的主题感知提示（包含共享和特定组件）从预训练语言模型中提取知识，结合对抗训练和邻居分类器生成伪标签以指导学习。

Result: 在ASAP++数据集上，ATOP在整体和多特质作文评分中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ATOP通过联合学习主题共享和特定特征，提升了跨主题AES的性能，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cross-topic automated essay scoring (AES) aims to develop a transferable
model capable of effectively evaluating essays on a target topic. A significant
challenge in this domain arises from the inherent discrepancies between topics.
While existing methods predominantly focus on extracting topic-shared features
through distribution alignment of source and target topics, they often neglect
topic-specific features, limiting their ability to assess critical traits such
as topic adherence. To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial
TOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns
topic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES. ATOP
achieves this by optimizing a learnable topic-aware prompt--comprising both
shared and specific components--to elicit relevant knowledge from pre-trained
language models (PLMs). To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt
learning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment,
we incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and
classification framework. In addition, we employ a neighbor-based classifier to
model the local structure of essay representations and generate pseudo-labels
for target-topic essays. These pseudo-labels are then used to guide the
supervised learning of topic-specific prompts tailored to the target topic.
Extensive experiments on the publicly available ASAP++ dataset demonstrate that
ATOP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
holistic and multi-trait essay scoring. The implementation of our method is
publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ATOP-A271.

Conclusion: 研究表明LLM能够处理和适应感官数据，为触觉信号的自然语言生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Haptic captioning is the task of generating natural language descriptions
from haptic signals, such as vibrations, for use in virtual reality,
accessibility, and rehabilitation applications. While previous multimodal
research has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the
sense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the
haptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language
model that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,
emotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic
tokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that
convert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their
integration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)
supervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,
and (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We
assess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics
and human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in
interpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a
BLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated
captions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF
yielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating
stronger alignment with human haptic perception. These findings highlight the
potential of large language models to process and adapt to sensory data.

injecting randomness to encourage diversity and leveraging self-refinement
feedback to encourage consistency in the emerging language description. We
evaluate ConlangCrafter on metrics measuring coherence and typological

Conclusion: 算法的公理化可以扩展到现代算法类型，为理解其行为提供了统一框架。

Abstract: This dialog paper offers a preview and provides a foretaste of an upcoming
work on the axiomatization of basic interactive algorithms.
  The modern notion of algorithm was elucidated in the 1930s--1950s. It was
axiomatized a quarter of a century ago as the notion of ``sequential
algorithm'' or ``classical algorithm''; we prefer to call it ``basic algorithm"
now. The axiomatization was used to show that for every basic algorithm there
is a behaviorally equivalent abstract state machine. It was also used to prove
the Church-Turing thesis as it has been understood by the logicians.
  Starting from the 1960s, the notion of algorithm has expanded --
probabilistic algorithms, quantum algorithms, etc. -- prompting introduction of
a much more ambitious version of the Church-Turing thesis commonly known as the
``physical thesis.'' We emphasize the difference between the two versions of
the Church-Turing thesis and illustrate how nondeterministic and probabilistic
algorithms can be viewed as basic algorithms with appropriate oracles. The same
view applies to quantum circuit algorithms and many other classes of
algorithms.

Result: 在视觉保真度和多模态理解上表现优异，训练计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Bifrost-1为高效可控图像生成提供了新思路，同时保持LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis
capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their
strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or
bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the
backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We
present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent
variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder.
These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with
a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation
branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the
patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and
diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables
high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training
efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or
better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and
multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We
also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our
design choices.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLMs）中视觉令牌数量过多导致的高计算开销和推理延迟问题。

Method: 利用二维离散余弦变换（DCT）对视觉特征进行低通滤波，通过FFT高效计算，减少额外计算成本。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，推理FLOPs减少83.8%，生成速度提升31.2%。

Conclusion: Fourier-VLM在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率，适用于多种架构。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image
placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from
an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM).
However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context
length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While
previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or
leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise
performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose
Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual
representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the
observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit
concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a
low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$,
minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional
parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks
demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong
generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it
reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2%
compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are
challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form
evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human
preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive,
and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we
introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual
animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual
perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes
point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between
models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect
more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion
variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good
agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our
BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over
90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and
proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light
groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables
BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance
visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on
ground-truth.

Result: 实验表明，LiLoRA在连续任务学习中表现优异，且参数效率显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LiLoRA是一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于多模态大语言模型的持续学习任务。

Abstract: Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this
process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on
previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common
approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces
task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often
expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead
and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA
(LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in
MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy,
applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize
task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss
to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive
experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves
superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving
parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant
attention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become
outdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination
issues. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{SDEval}, the
\textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the
distribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly
adopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to
generate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual
effects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that
injecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,
injecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is
general enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability
benchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and
capability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly
influences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety
limitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a
central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are
still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging
benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are
often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could
compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this
study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual
details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a
five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation
for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on
earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated
figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer
(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of
fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which
contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring
250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD
consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant
challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained
perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however,
they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively
refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce
SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human
visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and
image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural
language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a
reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of
interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which
in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose
GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual
grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically
correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding
and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general
capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 解决分布式训练中因变长文本输入和多分辨率图像-视频联合训练导致的GPU间工作负载不平衡问题。

Result: 在真实训练任务中实现小于1%的工作负载差异，消除拖尾效应，速度提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: KnapFormer显著提升了Diffusion Transformers的分布式训练效率。

Abstract: We present KnapFormer, an efficient and versatile framework to combine
workload balancing and sequence parallelism in distributed training of
Diffusion Transformers (DiT). KnapFormer builds on the insight that strong
synergy exists between sequence parallelism and the need to address the
significant token imbalance across ranks. This imbalance arises from
variable-length text inputs and varying visual token counts in mixed-resolution
and image-video joint training. KnapFormer redistributes tokens by first
gathering sequence length metadata across all ranks in a balancing group and
solving a global knapsack problem. The solver aims to minimize the variances of
total workload per-GPU, while accounting for the effect of sequence
parallelism. By integrating DeepSpeed-Ulysees-based sequence parallelism in the
load-balancing decision process and utilizing a simple semi-empirical workload
model, KnapFormers achieves minimal communication overhead and less than 1%
workload discrepancy in real-world training workloads with sequence length
varying from a few hundred to tens of thousands. It eliminates straggler
effects and achieves 2x to 3x speedup when training state-of-the-art diffusion
models like FLUX on mixed-resolution and image-video joint data corpora. We
open-source the KnapFormer implementation at

Conclusion: MathReal揭示了MLLMs的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing
benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or
processed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by
real-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address
this gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising
2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in
authentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text
and visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three
primary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and
irrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14
subcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability
categories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three
difficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical
reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we
design six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their
performance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the
problem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in
realistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis
of their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their
recognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining
directions for future improvements. Data and code:

Conclusion: AdaptInfer是一种轻量级、即插即用的高效剪枝方法，适用于多模态任务。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), but their
inference cost remains a significant challenge due to the large number of
vision tokens processed during the prefill stage. Existing pruning methods
often rely on directly using the attention patterns or static text prompt
guidance, failing to exploit the dynamic internal signals generated during
inference. To address these issues, we propose AdaptInfer, a plug-and-play
framework for adaptive vision token pruning in VLMs. First, we introduce a
fine-grained, dynamic text-guided pruning mechanism that reuses layer-wise
text-to-text attention maps to construct soft priors over text-token
importance, allowing more informed scoring of vision tokens at each stage.
Second, we perform an offline analysis of cross-modal attention shifts and
identify consistent inflection locations in inference, which inspire us to
propose a more principled and efficient pruning schedule. Our method is
lightweight and plug-and-play, also generalizable across multi-modal tasks.
Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.
For example, it reduces CUDA latency by 61.3\% while maintaining an average
accuracy of 92.9\% on vanilla LLaVA-1.5-7B. Under the same token budget,
AdaptInfer surpasses SOTA in accuracy.

Conclusion: FMCE-Net++能有效提升模型性能，无需额外数据或架构修改。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their
opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation
(FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores
(FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To
address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that
integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module
generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise
backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL
dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence
optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive
experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without
architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes
include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp

state-of-the-art performance ceilings.

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，GMF-Drive性能显著优于DiffusionDrive，验证了SSM在自动驾驶中的优势。

Conclusion: 任务特定的SSM在性能和效率上优于通用Transformer，为自动驾驶提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end
autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a
reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental
limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of
high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from
effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for
Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two
principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited
histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar
format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical
3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba
fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with
a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM
leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture
long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the
unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the
challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive.
Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component,
demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer
in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.

Result: VeSCA在五个领域数据集上性能提升12.7%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAM的漏洞对下游模型构成风险，亟需更鲁棒的基础模型。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation
with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point
risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications.
Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative.
Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to
insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we
propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that
leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial
examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the
shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a
parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within
adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight
domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using
minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex.
Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples
through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art
methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific
datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by
SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust
foundation models.

Result: 在三个数据集和六种跨域设置中，URPA仅需少量无标签视频即可良好泛化。

Conclusion: URPA解决了GRPO的标签依赖和计算开销问题，适用于实时部署。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments
matching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they
often struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group
Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a
reinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving
strong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it
unsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and
expensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces
prohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for
real-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient
Unlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first
trained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only
a small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach
eliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and
storage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce.
Uncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain
knowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels.
URPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages
them to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across
these rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the
model to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across
six cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few
unlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.

Abstract: Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically
collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak
supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation
but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for
contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability
to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose
CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated
into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment,
providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore,
two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities
respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive
learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse
downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a
plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is

Conclusion: TCA在自然和特定领域视频中均表现出色，为视频分割提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of
segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin
Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale
representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.
However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high
computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense
prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,
resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been
proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin
requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of
conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering
approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window
consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a
key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We
introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,
fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal
coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,
TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining
fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive
evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical
video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of
existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes
competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过GKM和KDE显著提升了少样本OOD检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Few-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a critical
research direction in machine learning for practical deployment. Most existing
Few-shot OOD detection methods suffer from insufficient generalization
capability for the open world. Due to the few-shot learning paradigm, the OOD
detection ability is often overfit to the limited training data itself, thus
degrading the performance on generalized data and performing inconsistently
across different scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed a
Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework, which empowers the general
knowledge of the OOD detection model with an auxiliary General Knowledge Model
(GKM), instead of directly learning from few-shot data. We proceed to reveal
the few-shot OOD detection from a generalization perspective and theoretically
derive the Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) for OOD detection, which
provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error with a general
knowledge model. Accordingly, we propose a Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE)
mechanism to adaptively modulate the guidance of general knowledge. KDE
dynamically aligns the output distributions of the OOD detection model to the
general knowledge model based on the Generalized Belief (G-Belief) of GKM,
thereby boosting the GS-balance. Experiments on real-world OOD benchmarks
demonstrate our superiority. Codes will be available.

Result: UnGuide在概念移除任务中优于现有LoRA方法，同时保持了扩散模型的表达能力。

Conclusion: UnGuide提供了一种高效且可控的模型遗忘方法，适用于需要精确移除特定概念的场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened
concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or
misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine
unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained
models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models
for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated
content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this
limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates
UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide
modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of
denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts
containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is
counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model
governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate
that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive
power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both
object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

Conclusion: ETTA为高效、有效的测试时适应设定了新标准。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot
performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test
data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,
training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,
current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence
samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the
influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that
integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision
boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating
contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and
computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to
reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting
optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores
from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary
strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses
the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,
setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code

regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather
than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in
(1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing
non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To
resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next
Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where
only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended
modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose
to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once
trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to
NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used
image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time
scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot
manner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/

Conclusion: PostDiff为扩散模型的高效部署提供了实用解决方案，尤其在资源受限场景下。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet
their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited
platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal
diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,
is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a
cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps
increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model
more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes
the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training
compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,
a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by
reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training
manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme
based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising
steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation
fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to
reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the
fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to
boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing
per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of
denoising steps. Our code is available at

Abstract: Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that
has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although
current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are
capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies
due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the
redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these
challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of
Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose
VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in
various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual
encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token
Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules
enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal
information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate
responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following
dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a
cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

Abstract: The integration of prompt tuning with multimodal learning has shown
significant generalization abilities for various downstream tasks. Despite
advancements, existing methods heavily depend on massive modality-specific
labeled data (e.g., video, audio, and image), or are customized for a single
modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt
Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general
representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data.
TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and
modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for
extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned
text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT
designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category
details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across
different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained
models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited
modalities. Remarkably, without any modality-specific labeled data, TaAM-CPT
achieves leading results on diverse datasets spanning various modalities,
including video classification, image classification, and audio classification.

Conclusion: U3-Attack是一种高效且通用的多模态越狱攻击方法，揭示了T2I模型安全防护的脆弱性。

Abstract: Various (text) prompt filters and (image) safety checkers have been
implemented to mitigate the misuse of Text-to-Image (T2I) models in creating
Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content.In order to expose potential security
vulnerabilities of such safeguards, multimodal jailbreaks have been
studied.However, existing jailbreaks are limited to prompt-specific and
image-specific perturbations, which suffer from poor scalability and
time-consuming optimization.To address these limitations, we propose
Universally Unfiltered and Unseen (U3)-Attack, a multimodal jailbreak attack
method against T2I safeguards.Specifically, U3-Attack optimizes an adversarial
patch on the image background to universally bypass safety checkers and
optimizes a safe paraphrase set from a sensitive word to universally bypass
prompt filters while eliminating redundant computations.Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of our U3-Attack on both open-source and
commercial T2I models.For example, on the commercial Runway-inpainting model
with both prompt filter and safety checker, our U3-Attack achieves $~4\times$
higher success rates than the state-of-the-art multimodal jailbreak attack,
MMA-Diffusion.Content Warning: This paper includes examples of NSFW content.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering
from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based
attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these
examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that
adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability
to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook
the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.
In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation
Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction
to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.
Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input
gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which
encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying
on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation
direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient
and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation
direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of
ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the
transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current
input transformation methods. The code is available at

Abstract: Medical image synthesis is an important topic for both clinical and research
applications. Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this
area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited
generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings,
(2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak
alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging.
MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but
still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this
work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis
framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality
generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel
region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of
interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality
with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a
downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be
used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model
weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further

large-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices,
we obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well
across tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a
frozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal
supervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a
hybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE
embeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both
skull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited
conditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our
framework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its
suitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging

challenges of rapid object motion and memory redundancy in SAM2. TSMS-SAM2
introduces two key strategies: multi-temporal-scale video sampling augmentation
to improve robustness against motion variability, and a memory splitting and
pruning mechanism that organizes and filters past frame features for more
efficient and accurate segmentation. Evaluated on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018
datasets, TSMS-SAM2 achieved the highest mean Dice scores of 95.24 and 86.73,

Abstract: Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving

estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using
static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a
vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze
through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB
images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using
human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception
with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both
low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation),
enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance
across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific
metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection
and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to
generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural
language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving.
Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior

Abstract: The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal
estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have
demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on
data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface
interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the
discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity
in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric
errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby
forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper
proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for
Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating
physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based
reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into
normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric
inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a
light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale
geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring
multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed
within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain
normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.
Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for
self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the
reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal
datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across
multiple metrics.

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion
models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict
erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel
environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies
in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data
distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution
(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions
regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a
mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model
that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.
We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to
minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the
source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',
or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor
datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an
average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors. Project Page:

Abstract: Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer

competition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To
address the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models
to extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities.
Specifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder
that captures both global frame-level features and localized facial
representations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched
method that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the
input text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a
fusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms
for dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original
representations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in
the training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a
substantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the
MER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to

Abstract: Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use
fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing
types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but
typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to
distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we
propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts
and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based
open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal
representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe
that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D
texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling
stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum
introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --
obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved
alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract
human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate
semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through
prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation
maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone
garments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We
conduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts,
clothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and
demonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in
prompt-based segmentation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution for the semi-supervised learning track
(MER-SEMI) in MER2025. We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the
principle that "more is better," to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE)
emotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input
modalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge
from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU)
information. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a
consensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from
the agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a
two-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble
combined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and
better align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI
challenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set,
ranking 2nd in the track. Our code is available at

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual
quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent
advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:
\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and
\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in
real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large
multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video
quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.
Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided
reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality
under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a
\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction
error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;
(2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly
determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal
consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent
videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD
VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.
Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its
superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to
existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that
reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building
generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is closer than ever to becoming a
reality, sparking widespread enthusiasm in the research community to collect
and work with various modalities, including text, image, video, and audio.
Despite recent efforts, satellite spectral imagery, as an additional modality,
has yet to receive the attention it deserves. This area presents unique

in understanding the natural world. In this paper, we argue why Earth
Observation data is useful for an intelligent model, and then we review
existing benchmarks and highlight their limitations in evaluating the
generalization ability of foundation models in this domain. This paper
emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive benchmark to evaluate earth
observation models. To facilitate this, we propose a comprehensive set of tasks
that a benchmark should encompass to effectively assess a model's ability to
understand and interact with Earth observation data.

Abstract: Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and
efficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing,
particularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,
hindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a
unified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We
propose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.
This offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models
are more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better
video editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and
aligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data
synthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data
synthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and
backgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,
background changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of
accurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE
on extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing
types and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,
collage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative
drop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite
being hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.
Therefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.
Besides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We
build on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop
approach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and
editability. The codes and models will be released.

Conclusion: SwiftVideo通过统一框架解决了少步视频生成的性能问题，为高效视频合成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in
video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs
substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are
solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been
developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer
from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and
stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of
trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach
introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise
preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective
alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data
along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method
maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number
of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
few-step video generation.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key
research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve
performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,
ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this
strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic
knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality
depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);
(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational
resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training
directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown
remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and
have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this
work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP
enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal
Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters
and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly
reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable
quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality
variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.
Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies
on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to
better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

Abstract: Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions.
Existing human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of
emotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive
tasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel
task: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional
cues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and
incorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging
problem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion
prior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction
synthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a
short sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a
semi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior,
we further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by
considering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a
motion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions
under various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will
be made publicly available at https://ereact.github.io/

Abstract: In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the
integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a
key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods
rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated
datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,
limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent
studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level
annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches
often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process
inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on
diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and
CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data
distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on
large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even
under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding
mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between
IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,
the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data
annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and
4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the
proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and
robustness.

Abstract: With the increasing availability of 2D and 3D data, significant advancements
have been made in the field of cross-modal retrieval. Nevertheless, the
existence of imperfect annotations presents considerable challenges, demanding
robust solutions for 2D-3D cross-modal retrieval in the presence of noisy label
conditions. Existing methods generally address the issue of noise by dividing
samples independently within each modality, making them susceptible to
overfitting on corrupted labels. To address these issues, we propose a robust
2D-3D \textbf{M}ulti-level cross-modal adaptive \textbf{C}orrection and
\textbf{A}lignment framework (MCA). Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal
Joint label Correction (MJC) mechanism that leverages multimodal historical
self-predictions to jointly model the modality prediction consistency, enabling
reliable label refinement. Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Adaptive
Alignment (MAA) strategy to effectively enhance cross-modal feature semantics

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task
due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and
complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for
expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder
using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to
learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of
this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using
a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to
learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and
nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The
progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly
robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving
structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised
pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3)
supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences.
Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER
performance. Our codebase can be found here.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories.
Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision
and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading
to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs
Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a
new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS).
Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category
alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of
correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS
reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior
fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the
foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg
effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination
under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance,
SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on
Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.

Abstract: We propose SC-Captioner, a reinforcement learning framework that enables the
self-correcting capability of image caption models. Our crucial technique lies
in the design of the reward function to incentivize accurate caption
corrections. Specifically, the predicted and reference captions are decomposed
into object, attribute, and relation sets using scene-graph parsing algorithms.
We calculate the set difference between sets of initial and self-corrected
captions to identify added and removed elements. These elements are matched
against the reference sets to calculate correctness bonuses for accurate
refinements and mistake punishments for wrong additions and removals, thereby
forming the final reward. For image caption quality assessment, we propose a
set of metrics refined from CAPTURE that alleviate its incomplete precision
evaluation and inefficient relation matching problems. Furthermore, we collect
a fine-grained annotated image caption dataset, RefinedCaps, consisting of 6.5K
diverse images from COCO dataset. Experiments show that applying SC-Captioner
on large visual-language models can generate better image captions across
various scenarios, significantly outperforming the direct preference
optimization training strategy.

optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during

generative data engine powered by the Recognize Anything via Prompting (RAP)
model, which synthesizes 0.5B diverse training instances through a dual-path

conventional approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prompt-DINO

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes
poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly
detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level
behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches
based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal
behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration.
This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic
descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses
adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term
contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event
subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal
activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset
that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level,
summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets
and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety
scenarios.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task across numerous domains and modalities,
yet existing methods are often highly specialized, limiting their
generalizability. These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types
like textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance
when deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation,
we propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based
on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the
complex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:
local structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global
logical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert
networks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in
reconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic
level. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently
understand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce
an Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an
Expert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization
of all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial
imaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical
anomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art
performance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their
respective domains.

Abstract: The generalization of deepfake detectors to unseen manipulation techniques
remains a challenge for practical deployment. Although many approaches adapt
foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this
work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a
parameter-efficient adaptation of a pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. The
proposed method, LNCLIP-DF, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters
(0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical
feature manifold using L2 normalization and latent space augmentations.
  We conducted an extensive evaluation on 13 benchmark datasets spanning from
2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC.
Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired
real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut
learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic
datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older,
diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities.
  This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method,
proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted,
minimal changes to a pre-trained CLIP model. The code will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

Result: 在BigEarthNet-S2和EuroSAT数据集上，FedX显著减少了共享参数数量，同时提升了全局模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedX成功降低了通信开销，优于未剪枝模型和其他先进剪枝方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural
networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client
stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This
makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image
classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal
and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is
the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model
updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses
explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the
size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages
backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific
importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the
central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients,
substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label
scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene
classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success
of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while
enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both
unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods. The code of FedX will be

Conclusion: GS-MoE通过类别特异性建模和时序指导，为弱监督视频异常检测设立新标杆。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of
anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the
Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided
during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although
state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),
they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This
difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to
address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a
shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak
supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the
ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of
Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each
specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a
temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal
consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach
encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by
focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The
predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a
mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse
anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on
XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and
temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.

Conclusion: 改进后的ViPro模型更适用于真实世界场景，解决了噪声观察问题。

Abstract: Predicting future video frames is a challenging task with many downstream
applications. Previous work has shown that procedural knowledge enables deep
models for complex dynamical settings, however their model ViPro assumed a
given ground truth initial symbolic state. We show that this approach led to
the model learning a shortcut that does not actually connect the observed
environment with the predicted symbolic state, resulting in the inability to
estimate states given an observation if previous states are noisy. In this
work, we add several improvements to ViPro that enables the model to correctly
infer states from observations without providing a full ground truth state in
the beginning. We show that this is possible in an unsupervised manner, and
extend the original Orbits dataset with a 3D variant to close the gap to real
world scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is
severely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a
novel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for
low labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled
samples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks --
a generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for
authenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier --
within a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between
supervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that
leverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather
than generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that
combines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier
with temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling
reliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across
eleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically
significant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised
methods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting
where the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging. The framework maintains
its superiority across all evaluated settings (5, 10, 20, and 50 shots per
class). Our approach offers a practical solution for medical imaging
applications where annotation costs are prohibitive, enabling robust
classification performance even with minimal labeled data. Code is available at

Conclusion: TRUST通过语言模态的引导和不确定性估计，显著提升了UDA在复杂域偏移中的性能。

Abstract: Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success
in addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still
suffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the
background and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior
works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,
exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce
TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language
modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates
pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel
uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to
estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated
uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the
adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To
further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal
soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature
spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision
model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as
both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are
attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their
captions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and
negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms
previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and
complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Breast cancer detection through mammography interpretation remains difficult
because of the minimal nature of abnormalities that experts need to identify
alongside the variable interpretations between readers. The potential of CNNs
for medical image analysis faces two limitations: they fail to process both
local information and wide contextual data adequately, and do not provide
explainable AI (XAI) operations that doctors need to accept them in clinics.
The researcher developed the MammoFormer framework, which unites
transformer-based architecture with multi-feature enhancement components and
XAI functionalities within one framework. Seven different architectures
consisting of CNNs, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, and ConvNext were
tested alongside four enhancement techniques, including original images,
negative transformation, adaptive histogram equalization, and histogram of
oriented gradients. The MammoFormer framework addresses critical clinical
adoption barriers of AI mammography systems through: (1) systematic
optimization of transformer architectures via architecture-specific feature
enhancement, achieving up to 13% performance improvement, (2) comprehensive
explainable AI integration providing multi-perspective diagnostic
interpretability, and (3) a clinically deployable ensemble system combining CNN
reliability with transformer global context modeling. The combination of
transformer models with suitable feature enhancements enables them to achieve
equal or better results than CNN approaches. ViT achieves 98.3% accuracy
alongside AHE while Swin Transformer gains a 13.0% advantage through HOG

Abstract: Although computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) and detection (CADe) systems have
made significant progress in various medical domains, their application is
still limited in specialized fields such as otorhinolaryngology. In the latter,
current assessment methods heavily depend on operator expertise, and the high
heterogeneity of lesions complicates diagnosis, with biopsy persisting as the
gold standard despite its substantial costs and risks. A critical bottleneck
for specialized endoscopic CADx/e systems is the lack of well-annotated
datasets with sufficient variability for real-world generalization. This study
introduces a novel approach that exploits a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM)
coupled with a ControlNet adapter to generate laryngeal endoscopic
image-annotation pairs, guided by clinical observations. The method addresses
data scarcity by conditioning the diffusion process to produce realistic,
high-quality, and clinically relevant image features that capture diverse
anatomical conditions. The proposed approach can be leveraged to expand
training datasets for CADx/e models, empowering the assessment process in
laryngology. Indeed, during a downstream task of detection, the addition of
only 10% synthetic data improved the detection rate of laryngeal lesions by 9%
when the model was internally tested and 22.1% on out-of-domain external data.
Additionally, the realism of the generated images was evaluated by asking 5
expert otorhinolaryngologists with varying expertise to rate their confidence
in distinguishing synthetic from real images. This work has the potential to
accelerate the development of automated tools for laryngeal disease diagnosis,
offering a solution to data scarcity and demonstrating the applicability of
synthetic data in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Affordance grounding focuses on predicting the specific regions of objects
that are associated with the actions to be performed by robots. It plays a
vital role in the fields of human-robot interaction, human-object interaction,
embodied manipulation, and embodied perception. Existing models often neglect
the affordance shared among different objects because they lack the
Chain-of-Thought(CoT) reasoning abilities, limiting their out-of-domain (OOD)
generalization and explicit reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Affordance-R1, the first unified affordance grounding
framework that integrates cognitive CoT guided Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. Specifically, we
designed a sophisticated affordance function, which contains format,
perception, and cognition rewards to effectively guide optimization directions.
Furthermore, we constructed a high-quality affordance-centric reasoning
dataset, ReasonAff, to support training. Trained exclusively via reinforcement
learning with GRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Affordance-R1 achieves
robust zero-shot generalization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning
capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms
well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization. To the best of

Abstract: Artistic style transfer has long been possible with the advancements of
convolution- and transformer-based neural networks. Most algorithms apply the
artistic style transfer to the whole image, but individual users may only need
to apply a style transfer to a specific region in the image. The standard
practice is to simply mask the image after the stylization. This work shows
that this approach tends to improperly capture the style features in the region
of interest. We propose a partial-convolution-based style transfer network that
accurately applies the style features exclusively to the region of interest.
Additionally, we present network-internal blending techniques that account for
imperfections in the region selection. We show that this visually and
quantitatively improves stylization using examples from the SA-1B dataset. Code

Abstract: The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many
previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while
incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on
the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free
approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph
structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A
feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated
back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and
3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization.
This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2
minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results
this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer
methods. Code is publicly available at

different camera views to improve accuracy and expand applicability, addressing
limitations in existing single-view methods that face challenges such as face

pair of camera views as input, incorporating a Head Information Aggregation
(HIA) module for leveraging head information from both views for more accurate
gaze estimation, an Uncertainty-based Gaze Selection (UGS) for identifying the
most reliable gaze output, and an Epipolar-based Scene Attention (ESA) module
for cross-view background information sharing. This approach significantly
outperforms single-view baselines, especially when the second camera provides a
clear view of the person's face. Additionally, our method can estimate the gaze
target in the first view using the image of the person in the second view only,
a capability not possessed by single-view GTE methods. Furthermore, the paper

a result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing
attention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced
vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for
interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate
diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and
cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input
descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK
2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects
required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via
state-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial
constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and
physically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments
demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely
aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming
baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide
editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout
refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical
application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually
rich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, mobile imaging has experienced a profound
transformation, with cell phones rapidly eclipsing all other forms of digital
photography in popularity. Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse
range of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,
and split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated
chips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile
pocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in
recent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map
continuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the
reconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as
pixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully
designed neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and
lighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer
separation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile
photography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without
relying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine
learning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized
models that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient
descent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.

Conclusion: PASG为机器人操作中几何基元与任务语义的统一提供了新范式。

Abstract: The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric
features remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware
visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and
reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic
semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware
Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1)
Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling
cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic
anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional
affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning
benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's
effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,
achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a
finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a
unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in
robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: 该方法通过减少冗余和优化计算，实现了高效视频处理。

Abstract: The efficiency of video computer vision system remains a challenging task due
to the high temporal redundancy inside a video. Existing works have been
proposed for efficient vision computer vision. However, they do not fully
reduce the temporal redundancy and neglect the front end computation overhead.
In this paper, we propose an efficient video computer vision system. First,
image signal processor is removed and Bayer-format data is directly fed into
video computer vision models, thus saving the front end computation. Second,
instead of optical flow models and video codecs, a fast block matching-based
motion estimation algorithm is proposed specifically for efficient video
computer vision, with a MV refinement module. To correct the error,
context-aware block refinement network is introduced to refine regions with
large error. To further balance the accuracy and efficiency, a frame selection
strategy is employed. Experiments on multiple video computer vision tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves significant acceleration with slight
performance loss.

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS) have enabled real-time

diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with
these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate
our method, we present Wild-Explore, a benchmark designed for challenging scene

Abstract: Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with
deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the
distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles.
However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle
types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class
classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less
effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for
particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as
silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining
large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively
straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to
address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment
training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural
networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples
closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure.
To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training
datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising
500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves
classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote
open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion
models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with
a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at

RectifiedFlow by introducing a specialized inversion strategy called PerRFI. To
maintain consistent while editable results for RectifiedFlow model, we further
propose a novel regeneration method, Inversion Latent Injection, which
effectively reuses latent information obtained during inversion to facilitate
more coherent and detailed regeneration. Additionally, we propose a
Disentangled Prompt Guidance technique to balance editability with detail
preservation, and integrate a Canny-conditioned ControlNet to incorporate

Conclusion: TSANet为移动设备上的高效图像去马赛克提供了新可能。

Abstract: Event cameras like the Hybrid Event-based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) camera
capture brightness changes as asynchronous "events" instead of frames, offering
advanced application on mobile photography. However, challenges arise from
combining a Quad Bayer Color Filter Array (CFA) sensor with event pixels
lacking color information, resulting in aliasing and artifacts on the
demosaicing process before downstream application. Current methods struggle to
address these issues, especially on resource-limited mobile devices. In
response, we introduce \textbf{TSANet}, a lightweight \textbf{T}wo-stage
network via \textbf{S}tate space augmented cross-\textbf{A}ttention, which can
handle event pixels inpainting and demosaicing separately, leveraging the
benefits of dividing complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Furthermore, we
introduce a lightweight Cross-Swin State Block that uniquely utilizes
positional prior for demosaicing and enhances global dependencies through the
state space model with linear complexity. In summary, TSANet demonstrates
excellent demosaicing performance on both simulated and real data of HybridEVS
while maintaining a lightweight model, averaging better results than the
previous state-of-the-art method DemosaicFormer across seven diverse datasets
in both PSNR and SSIM, while respectively reducing parameter and computation
costs by $1.86\times$ and $3.29\times$. Our approach presents new possibilities
for efficient image demosaicing on mobile devices. Code is available in the

Abstract: This study applied representation learning algorithms to satellite images and
evaluated the learned latent spaces with classifications of various weather
events. The algorithms investigated include the classical linear
transformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep
learning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network
pre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated
that the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores
for all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit
rates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed
exceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other
tasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from
higher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for
deep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent
space sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a
latent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false
alarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently,
the interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to
physical attributions. Therefore, developing a physics-informed version of CAE
can be a promising outlook for the current work.

translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a
dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully
reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the
3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module
that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes.
Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our
framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving
superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Combining sparse IMUs and a monocular camera is a new promising setting to
perform real-time human motion capture. This paper proposes a diffusion-based
solution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals
together seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the
characteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is
considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the
inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to
construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that
the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or
subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential
visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the
occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other
hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when
signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could
better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art
performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works. Our codes are

Abstract: Underwater 3D scene reconstruction faces severe challenges from light
absorption, scattering, and turbidity, which degrade geometry and color

reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We

robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play
learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for
spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware
Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating
Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The
pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy
Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP
pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean
Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned
physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light
transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior
performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on
SeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.

objects' physical attributes on human motion dynamics, including human posture,
moving velocity, and other motion characteristics. The dataset comprises 562
motion sequences of human-object interactions, with each sequence performed by
subjects of different genders interacting with 35 3D objects that vary in size,
shape, and weight. This dataset stands out by significantly extending the scope
of existing ones for understanding how the physical attributes of different
objects influence human posture, speed, motion scale, and interacting
strategies. We further demonstrate the applicability of the PA-HOI dataset by
integrating it with existing motion generation methods, validating its capacity
to transfer realistic physical awareness.

Conclusion: TEFormer通过纹理感知和边缘引导机制有效提升了城市遥感图像的语义分割精度。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of urban remote sensing images (URSIs) is crucial for
applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. However,
geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial
structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.
Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and
overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and
diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To
tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer
(TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for
semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is
designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar
categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch
decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for
multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module
(EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to
realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer
achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and
LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic
segmentation.

Method: 采用自适应深度偏移技术，基于深度方差阈值生成合成深度扰动，同时保持结构完整性。

Result: 在FathomNet和UTDAC2020数据集上验证了Depth-Jitter对模型稳定性的提升，尽管绝对性能未必优于传统方法。

Conclusion: Depth-Jitter为深度感知数据增强提供了新思路，支持进一步研究深度相关学习策略。

Abstract: Depth information is essential in computer vision, particularly in underwater
imaging, robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, conventional
augmentation techniques overlook depth aware transformations, limiting model
robustness in real world depth variations. In this paper, we introduce
Depth-Jitter, a novel depth-based augmentation technique that simulates natural
depth variations to improve generalization. Our approach applies adaptive depth
offsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth
perturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter
on two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on
model stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare
Depth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter,
analyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss
functions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods
in absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and
generalization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the
potential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a
foundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies. The
proposed technique is publicly available to support advancements in depth-aware
augmentation. The code is publicly available on

Abstract: Image deblurring, removing blurring artifacts from images, is a fundamental
task in computational photography and low-level computer vision. Existing
approaches focus on specialized solutions tailored to particular blur types,
thus, these solutions lack generalization. This limitation in current methods
implies requiring multiple models to cover several blur types, which is not
practical in many real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first
all-in-one deblurring method capable of efficiently restoring images affected
by diverse blur degradations, including global motion, local motion, blur in
low-light conditions, and defocus blur. We propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE)
decoding module, which dynamically routes image features based on the
recognized blur degradation, enabling precise and efficient restoration in an
end-to-end manner. Our unified approach not only achieves performance
comparable to dedicated task-specific models, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness and generalization capabilities on unseen blur degradation
scenarios.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including cardiac MR, is prone to domain
shift due to variations in imaging devices and acquisition protocols. This
challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,
where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve
increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or
additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.
Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural
consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in
creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)
trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that
resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural
fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the
segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in
multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and
vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,
domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain
data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the
source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation
performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based
metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on
real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning
or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image
analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.

Abstract: A central problem in one-to-many facial identification is that the person in
the probe image may or may not have enrolled image(s) in the gallery; that is,
may be In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Past approaches to detect when a rank-one
result is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on
the similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled
images of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one
result is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and
images, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting
the ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity.
We then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a
rank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets
and four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our
approach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for
probes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and
sunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that
In-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across
demographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate
of whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby
to reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted
investigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep
CNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our
Out-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using
advanced margin-based loss functions.

Conclusion: FVGen显著提升了稀疏输入视图下下游重建任务的时间效率。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from
dense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading
to artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models
(VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views
are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these
methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present
FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel
view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel
video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising
teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous
works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or
even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%.
FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction
tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where
pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial
coverage.

Abstract: High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of
visual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
In many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution
images can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this,
super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related
traditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on
pixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image
fidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This
raises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into
the super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this
paper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship
between super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a
specialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases
the resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions
that account for both image quality and classification performance. Our
approach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained
image quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.

Conclusion: LightSwitch通过整合内在属性和多视角数据，显著提升了重光照效果和效率。

Abstract: Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D
image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D
representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless,
generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input
image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be
inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar
relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned
material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary
number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues
from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material
information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method
consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with
diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction
quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly
relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or
outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting
synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.

Abstract: With the advancement of personalized image generation technologies, concerns
about forgery attacks that infringe on portrait rights and privacy are growing.
To address these concerns, protection perturbation algorithms have been
developed to disrupt forgery generation. However, the protection algorithms
would become ineffective when forgery attackers apply purification techniques
to bypass the protection. To address this issue, we present a novel approach,
Anti-Tamper Perturbation (ATP). ATP introduces a tamper-proof mechanism within
the perturbation. It consists of protection and authorization perturbations,
where the protection perturbation defends against forgery attacks, while the
authorization perturbation detects purification-based tampering. Both
protection and authorization perturbations are applied in the frequency domain
under the guidance of a mask, ensuring that the protection perturbation does
not disrupt the authorization perturbation. This design also enables the
authorization perturbation to be distributed across all image pixels,
preserving its sensitivity to purification-based tampering. ATP demonstrates
its effectiveness in defending forgery attacks across various attack settings
through extensive experiments, providing a robust solution for protecting
individuals' portrait rights and privacy. Our code is available at:

Result: 在多个场景中，MZEN显著提升PSNR、SSIM，降低LPIPS，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MZEN扩展了NeRF在工业检测中的应用，兼顾全局精度与微米级细节。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods excel at 3D reconstruction from
multiple 2D images, even those taken with unknown camera poses. However, they
still miss the fine-detailed structures that matter in industrial inspection,
e.g., detecting sub-micron defects on a production line or analyzing chips with
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In these scenarios, the sensor resolution
is fixed and compute budgets are tight, so the only way to expose fine
structure is to add zoom-in images; yet, this breaks the multi-view consistency
that pose-free NeRF training relies on. We propose Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF
(MZEN), the first NeRF framework that natively handles multi-zoom image sets.
MZEN (i) augments the pin-hole camera model with an explicit, learnable zoom
scalar that scales the focal length, and (ii) introduces a novel pose strategy:
wide-field images are solved first to establish a global metric frame, and
zoom-in images are then pose-primed to the nearest wide-field counterpart via a
zoom-consistent crop-and-match procedure before joint refinement. Across eight
forward-facing scenes$\unicode{x2013}$synthetic TCAD models, real SEM of
micro-structures, and BLEFF objects$\unicode{x2013}$MZEN consistently
outperforms pose-free baselines and even high-resolution variants, boosting
PSNR by up to $28 \%$, SSIM by $10 \%$, and reducing LPIPS by up to $222 \%$.
MZEN, therefore, extends NeRF to real-world factory settings, preserving global
accuracy while capturing the micron-level details essential for industrial
inspection.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and 4D human animation have seen rapid progress and
broad adoption in recent years. However, seamlessly integrating reconstructed
scenes with 4D human animation to produce visually engaging results remains
challenging. One key difficulty lies in placing the human at the correct
location and scale within the scene while avoiding unrealistic
interpenetration. Another challenge is that the human and the background may
exhibit different lighting and style, leading to unrealistic composites. In
addition, appealing character motion videos are often accompanied by camera
movements, which means that the viewpoints need to be reconstructed along a
specified trajectory. We present AnimateScene, which addresses the above issues
in a unified framework. First, we design an accurate placement module that
automatically determines a plausible 3D position for the human and prevents any
interpenetration within the scene during motion. Second, we propose a
training-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human representation to
match the background's lighting and style, achieving coherent visual
integration. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction method for both the
4D human and the 3D scene that allows camera trajectories to be inserted,
enabling the final rendered video to feature visually appealing camera
movements. Extensive experiments show that AnimateScene generates dynamic scene
videos with high geometric detail and spatiotemporal coherence across various
camera and action combinations.

Conclusion: 该方法在化妆保真度和身份保持方面取得了平衡，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Facial makeup editing aims to realistically transfer makeup from a reference
to a target face. Existing methods often produce low-quality results with
coarse makeup details and struggle to preserve both identity and makeup
fidelity, mainly due to the lack of structured paired data -- where source and
result share identity, and reference and result share identical makeup. To
address this, we introduce MakeupQuad, a large-scale, high-quality dataset with
non-makeup faces, references, edited results, and textual makeup descriptions.
Building on this, we propose EvoMakeup, a unified training framework that
mitigates image degradation during multi-stage distillation, enabling iterative
improvement of both data and model quality. Although trained solely on
synthetic data, EvoMakeup generalizes well and outperforms prior methods on
real-world benchmarks. It supports high-fidelity, controllable, multi-task
makeup editing -- including full-face and partial reference-based editing, as
well as text-driven makeup editing -- within a single model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior makeup fidelity and
identity preservation, effectively balancing both aspects. Code and dataset

Abstract: Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for
neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape
variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from
limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing
individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint
LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships
embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation
artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying
the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our
method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate
LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections,
and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally,
we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that
show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal
controls. The codes for LV shape modeling are available at

Conclusion: SCJoint和SBSS成功实现了对矛盾任务的联合学习，训练出的JoNet网络能同时处理显著和伪装目标检测。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two
closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are
class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the
former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter
focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the
background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory
attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these
two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.
However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to
learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both
salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint
learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,
assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution
characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and
variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal
amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network
structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at
a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy
(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set
sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and
shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a
powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to
simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive
experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our
proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/JoNet.

Conclusion: DSConv为遥感图像融合提供了高效解决方案，并讨论了其优越性和适用条件。

Abstract: Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion
of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level
vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research.
Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few
making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the
inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a
novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction
with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original
convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed
DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the
receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and
feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich
concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network
architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently,
building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the
effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by
DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and
optimal usage conditions of DSConv.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
severely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in
AD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due
to the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep
learning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance
imaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear
relationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their
ability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,
we propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane
fusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial
planes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention
mechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy
features. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction
from multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural
information. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible
and accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise
identification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments
on the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior
performance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of
right-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD
progression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.

Abstract: Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy
and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying
disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural
effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels
between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable
morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and
complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic
gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive
Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested
skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature
Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the
functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity
and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a
Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically
with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and
frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.
Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical
adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation
on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet
achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results
outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and
Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant
optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.

Abstract: Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet
existing quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than
the quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery --
an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social
information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social
science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images
from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's
taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative
example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or
complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression
models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian
counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with
city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with
environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived
from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban
planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability
types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place
attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results
provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer
relationships between specific types of social interactions and built
environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as
a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling
cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant
cities.

Abstract: Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the
demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface
Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from
remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer
promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m
resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative
Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra
MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning
framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative
adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature
extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage
employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from
the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,
normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the
fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to
suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy
based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN
discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the
best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves
SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and
effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33
ground-based sensors. The code is available at

Abstract: We present \textit{RopStitch}, an unsupervised deep image stitching framework
with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of
\textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content
perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It
separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve
highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.
Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture
semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract
fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a
controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content
alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we
propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this
end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition
coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal
semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is
finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the
optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets
demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness. The code is available

Abstract: To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on
low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition.
The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption
of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose
a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy
target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an
isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation
(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label
custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to
generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In
contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,
our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes
compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative
blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella
articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a
CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our
approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies
significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD).

Abstract: The Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) score has been widely used in clinical trials
to quantify radiographic damage in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but its
complexity has limited its adoption in routine clinical practice. To address
the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for
interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs.
Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using
attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for
prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles
most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing
disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction
model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root
mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted
prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving
state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced
radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively
identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians

Abstract: In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase image
segmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in
\cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into
foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned
membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the
segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be
summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are
smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is
a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally
proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image
data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.
Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so
that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman
method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed
implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance
with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.

Abstract: The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a widely used imaging device in

(2D) SEM images do not directly reveal the three-dimensional (3D) topography of
micro samples, motivating the development of SEM 3D surface reconstruction

errors. Here, we introduce NFH-SEM, a neural field-based hybrid SEM 3D
reconstruction method that takes multi-view, multi-detector 2D SEM images as
input and fuses geometric and photometric information into a continuous neural
field representation. NFH-SEM eliminates the manual calibration procedures
through end-to-end self-calibration and automatically disentangles shadows from
SEM images during training, enabling accurate reconstruction of intricate
microstructures. We validate the effectiveness of NFH-SEM on real and simulated
datasets. Our experiments show high-fidelity reconstructions of diverse,
challenging samples, including two-photon lithography microstructures, peach
pollen, and silicon carbide particle surfaces, demonstrating precise detail and
broad applicability.

*Dewi S. W. Gould,Bruno Mlodozeniec,Samuel F. Brown*

Main category: cs.AI

Relevance: 90.0

TL;DR: SKATE是一种新型评估框架，利用LLMs相互生成和解决可验证任务，实现自动化、数据无关且可扩展的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法需要大量领域专业知识，难以跟上LLMs的快速发展，因此需要一种更通用的评估框架。

Method: 将评估视为游戏，LLMs既作为任务设置者又作为解决者，生成可验证任务（如代码输出预测挑战），并通过TrueSkill排名系统评估模型。

Result: 发现较弱模型能可靠区分较强模型，LLMs存在自偏好行为，且SKATE能自动揭示模型间的细粒度能力差异。

Conclusion: SKATE是迈向通用、可扩展评估框架的重要一步，能跟上LLM的发展速度。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities and risks of foundation models is paramount, yet
current methods demand extensive domain expertise, hindering their scalability
as these models rapidly evolve. We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation
framework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and
solving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat
evaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized
to create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others'
weaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability,
open-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and
scalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable
tasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited
programmatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial
reasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and
scalable evaluation. As a proof of concept, we introduce LLM-set
code-output-prediction (COP) challenges as a verifiable and extensible
framework in which to test our approach. Using a TrueSkill-based ranking
system, we evaluate six frontier LLMs and find that: (1) weaker models can
reliably differentiate and score stronger ones, (2) LLM-based systems are
capable of self-preferencing behavior, generating questions that align with
their own capabilities, and (3) SKATE automatically surfaces fine-grained
capability differences between models. Our findings are an important step
towards general, scalable evaluation frameworks which can keep pace with LLM
progress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在GUI任务中面临语义对齐的挑战，现有方法（如RLVR）在空间对齐上表现良好，但在语义对齐上因探索效率低而受限。

Method: 提出AEPO框架，采用多答案生成策略和基于效率理论的自适应探索奖励（AER）函数，以优化策略。

Result: AEPO训练的模型（InfiGUI-G1-3B和InfiGUI-G1-7B）在多个GUI基准测试中达到新SOTA，相对基线提升9.0%。

Conclusion: AEPO有效解决了语义对齐的探索问题，为MLLMs在GUI任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the
development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding
natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which
accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a
correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally
appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these
MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,
which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address
this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization
(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer
generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a
theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from
first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B
and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple
challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative
improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks
designed to test generalization and semantic understanding. Resources are

Motivation: 传统AI安全方法（如事后可解释性和奖励工程）存在根本性局限，需将安全性融入系统核心设计。

Method: 通过透明信念表示和分层价值对齐，利用自然语言作为信念操作媒介，构建多智能体系统，实现资源感知的自由能最小化和模块化安全机制。

Result: 提出了一种安全性内生的AGI开发路径，并计划通过ARC基准验证其安全性。

Conclusion: 该框架为AGI提供了一种更安全的发展方向，而非依赖事后安全措施。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language
Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on
post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations.
We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the
system's core design through transparent belief representations and
hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a
medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human
oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture
implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active
Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through
hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring
safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in
natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy
minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures.
The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our
framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI
development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety
measures.

Motivation: 现有LLM在动态、长时任务（如实时战略游戏）中表现不佳，需要适应部分可观察环境和资源约束。

Result: HIMA在战略清晰性、适应性和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合专用模仿模块和元级协调可开发更鲁棒、通用的AI智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive action
sequence prediction capabilities but often struggle with dynamic, long-horizon
tasks such as real-time strategic games. In a game such as StarCraftII (SC2),
agents need to manage resource constraints and adapt to evolving battlefield
situations in a partially observable environment. This often overwhelms
exisiting LLM-based approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical multi-agent framework that employs specialized imitation learning
agents under a meta-controller called Strategic Planner (SP). By expert
demonstrations, each specialized agent learns a distinctive strategy, such as
aerial support or defensive maneuvers, and produces coherent, structured
multistep action sequences. The SP then orchestrates these proposals into a
single, environmentally adaptive plan that ensures local decisions aligning
with long-term strategies. We call this HIMA (Hierarchical Imitation
Multi-Agent). We also present TEXTSCII-ALL, a comprehensive SC2 testbed that
encompasses all race match combinations in SC2. Our empirical results show that
HIMA outperforms state of the arts in strategic clarity, adaptability, and
computational efficiency, underscoring the potential of combining specialized
imitation modules with meta-level orchestration to develop more robust,
general-purpose AI agents.

Motivation: 探索LLM在结构化资源分配任务中的能力，并解决现有评估基准的数据污染和静态性问题。

Method: 采用三种提示策略（贪婪选择、直接优化和启发式改进）让LLM在预算约束下选择项目子集，并与效用最大化基准对比。还测试LLM从自然语言输入推断偏好的能力。

Result: 结果表明提示设计的重要性，并显示LLM在机制设计（尤其是非结构化输入）方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: LLM在资源分配和偏好推断任务中表现出潜力，提示设计是关键因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to handle complex
decision-making tasks, yet their ability to perform structured resource
allocation remains underexplored. Evaluating their reasoning is also difficult
due to data contamination and the static nature of existing benchmarks. We
present a dual-purpose framework leveraging Participatory Budgeting (PB) both
as (i) a practical setting for LLM-based resource allocation and (ii) an
adaptive benchmark for evaluating their reasoning capabilities. We task LLMs
with selecting project subsets under feasibility (e.g., budget) constraints via
three prompting strategies: greedy selection, direct optimization, and a
hill-climbing-inspired refinement. We benchmark LLMs' allocations against a
utility-maximizing oracle. Interestingly, we also test whether LLMs can infer
structured preferences from natural-language voter input or metadata, without
explicit votes. By comparing allocations based on inferred preferences to those
from ground-truth votes, we evaluate LLMs' ability to extract preferences from
open-ended input. Our results underscore the role of prompt design and show
that LLMs hold promise for mechanism design with unstructured inputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where
practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments.
Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity
of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable
evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric
evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing
the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive
evaluation. We systematically identify the **Overconfidence Phenomenon** in
current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates
actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To
quantify this phenomenon, we introduce **TH-Score**, a novel metric measuring
confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose **LLM-as-a-Fuser**, an
ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves
calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines,
achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.

Method: 提出“Fair Game”机制，将审计员和去偏算法通过RL结合，动态调整公平目标。

Result: “Fair Game”能够模拟社会伦理和法律框架的演变，提供了一种灵活且适应性的公平ML系统构建方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为公平ML系统在部署前后的灵活性和适应性提供了新思路。

Abstract: An emerging field of AI, namely Fair Machine Learning (ML), aims to quantify
different types of bias (also known as unfairness) exhibited in the predictions
of ML algorithms, and to design new algorithms to mitigate them. Often, the
definitions of bias used in the literature are observational, i.e. they use the
input and output of a pre-trained algorithm to quantify a bias under concern.
In reality,these definitions are often conflicting in nature and can only be
deployed if either the ground truth is known or only in retrospect after
deploying the algorithm. Thus,there is a gap between what we want Fair ML to
achieve and what it does in a dynamic social environment. Hence, we propose an
alternative dynamic mechanism,"Fair Game",to assure fairness in the predictions
of an ML algorithm and to adapt its predictions as the society interacts with
the algorithm over time. "Fair Game" puts together an Auditor and a Debiasing
algorithm in a loop around an ML algorithm. The "Fair Game" puts these two
components in a loop by leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL algorithms
interact with an environment to take decisions, which yields new observations
(also known as data/feedback) from the environment and in turn, adapts future
decisions. RL is already used in algorithms with pre-fixed long-term fairness
goals. "Fair Game" provides a unique framework where the fairness goals can be
adapted over time by only modifying the auditor and the different biases it
quantifies. Thus,"Fair Game" aims to simulate the evolution of ethical and
legal frameworks in the society by creating an auditor which sends feedback to
a debiasing algorithm deployed around an ML system. This allows us to develop a
flexible and adaptive-over-time framework to build Fair ML systems pre- and
post-deployment.

Abstract: While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is now widely adopted to enhance

they lack domain coverage, employ coarse metrics that miss sub document
precision, and fail to capture computational trade offs. Most critically, they
provide no standardized framework for comparing RAG effectiveness across
different models and domains.
  We introduce OmniBench RAG, a novel automated platform for multi domain
evaluation of RAG systems. The platform quantifies performance gains across
accuracy and efficiency dimensions, spanning nine knowledge fields including
culture, geography, and health. We introduce two standardized metrics:
Improvements (accuracy gains) and Transformation (efficiency differences
between pre RAG and post RAG models), enabling reproducible comparisons across
models and tasks. The platform features dynamic test generation, modular
evaluation pipelines, and automated knowledge base construction. Our evaluation
reveals striking variability in RAG effectiveness, from significant gains in
culture to declines in mathematics, highlighting the critical importance of
systematic, domain aware assessment. A demonstration video is available at:

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle with
domain-specific knowledge due to performance deterioration of pre-trained
embeddings and prohibitive computational costs of large language model
(LLM)-based retrievers. While fine-tuning data augmentation embedding models
offers a promising direction, its effectiveness is limited by the need for
high-quality training data and reliable chunking strategies that preserve
contextual integrity. We propose LMAR (Language Model Augmented Retriever), a
model-agnostic framework that addresses these challenges by combining
LLM-guided data synthesis with contrastive embedding adaptation and efficient
text clustering. LMAR consists of a two-stage pipeline: (1) Triplet sampling
and synthetic data augmentation, where LLMs act as both labeler and validator
to ensure high-fidelity supervision throughout the pipeline. Experimental
results across multiple domain-specific benchmark datasets demonstrate that
LMAR outperforms multiple baseline models, while maintaining moderate hardware
requirements and low latency. Its model-agnostic nature further enables
seamless integration with emerging RAG architectures and text embedding models,
ensuring continual improvements without redesigning the pipeline. These results
highlight LMAR as a practical and cost-effective solution for scalable
domain-specific adaptation.

Conclusion: 伦理AI设计需考虑用户角色和产品类型的差异。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly embedded in organizational workflows and
consumer applications, ethical principles such as fairness, transparency, and
robustness have been widely endorsed in policy and industry guidelines.
However, there is still scarce empirical evidence on whether these principles
are recognized, valued, or impactful from the perspective of users. This study
investigates the link between ethical AI and user satisfaction by analyzing
over 100,000 user reviews of AI products from G2. Using transformer-based
language models, we measure sentiment across seven ethical dimensions defined
by the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI. Our findings show that all
seven dimensions are positively associated with user satisfaction. Yet, this
relationship varies systematically across user and product types. Technical
users and reviewers of AI development platforms more frequently discuss
system-level concerns (e.g., transparency, data governance), while
non-technical users and reviewers of end-user applications emphasize
human-centric dimensions (e.g., human agency, societal well-being). Moreover,
the association between ethical AI and user satisfaction is significantly
stronger for non-technical users and end-user applications across all
dimensions. Our results highlight the importance of ethical AI design from
users' perspectives and underscore the need to account for contextual
differences across user roles and product types.

built on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts
that simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on
single-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts
dynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion
strategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety
guardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective
against such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level
safeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered
incrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the
transformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern
text-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our
findings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level
control frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational
deception powered by generative AI.

Conclusion: 提出的算法能有效解决LLM请求调度问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study the problem of serving LLM (Large Language Model) requests where
each request has heterogeneous prefill and decode lengths. In LLM serving, the
prefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the
initial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of
output tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the
KV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to
schedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that
this problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement
constraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We
then analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as
First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their
competitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant
drawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this,
we propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently
forms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant
competitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants
inspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search
methods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive
simulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining
computational efficiency.

Motivation: 探索大型预测模型是否仅模仿训练数据或产生真实洞察，缺乏物理解释。研究旨在揭示直觉作为学习中的临界相。

Method: 采用mind-tuning方法，结合Maximum Caliber原则和控制参数λ，训练模型在确定性迷宫中的随机行走任务。

Result: 发现三种学习相：模仿（低λ）、幻觉（高λ）和直觉（临界λ），后者表现出协议依赖性和多稳态。

Conclusion: 直觉是记忆与探索临界平衡的涌现属性，为模型行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Whether large predictive models merely parrot their training data or produce
genuine insight lacks a physical explanation. This work reports a primitive
form of intuition that emerges as a metastable phase of learning that
critically balances next-token prediction against future path-entropy. The
intuition mechanism is discovered via mind-tuning, the minimal principle that
imposes Maximum Caliber in predictive models with a control temperature-like
parameter $\lambda$. Training on random walks in deterministic mazes reveals a
rich phase diagram: imitation (low $\lambda$), rule-breaking hallucination
(high $\lambda$), and a fragile in-between window exhibiting strong
protocol-dependence (hysteresis) and multistability, where models spontaneously
discover novel goal-directed strategies. These results are captured by an
effective low-dimensional theory and frame intuition as an emergent property at
the critical balance between memorizing what is and wondering what could be.

Motivation: 解决表格推理任务中依赖标注数据和复杂数据增强的问题，以及LLM在此类任务中表现不佳的现状。

Method: PanelTR通过五个科学家角色驱动的代理科学家进行独立调查、自我审查和协作同行评审，实现语义级迁移。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，PanelTR优于普通LLM，并与全监督模型表现相当，且无需训练数据。

Conclusion: 结构化科学方法可在零样本情境下灵活处理复杂任务，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Table reasoning, including tabular QA and fact verification, often depends on
annotated data or complex data augmentation, limiting flexibility and
generalization. LLMs, despite their versatility, often underperform compared to
simple supervised models. To approach these issues, we introduce PanelTR, a
framework utilizing LLM agent scientists for robust table reasoning through a
structured scientific approach. PanelTR's workflow involves agent scientists
conducting individual investigations, engaging in self-review, and
participating in collaborative peer-review discussions. This process, driven by
five scientist personas, enables semantic-level transfer without relying on
data augmentation or parametric optimization. Experiments across four
benchmarks show that PanelTR outperforms vanilla LLMs and rivals fully
supervised models, all while remaining independent of training data. Our
findings indicate that structured scientific methodology can effectively handle
complex tasks beyond table reasoning with flexible semantic understanding in a
zero-shot context.

Abstract: Current eXplainable AI (XAI) methods largely serve developers, often focusing
on justifying model outputs rather than supporting diverse stakeholder needs. A
recent shift toward Evaluative AI reframes explanation as a tool for hypothesis
testing, but still focuses primarily on operational organizations. We introduce
Holistic-XAI (H-XAI), a unified framework that integrates causal rating methods
with traditional XAI methods to support explanation as an interactive,
multi-method process. H-XAI allows stakeholders to ask a series of questions,
test hypotheses, and compare model behavior against automatically constructed
random and biased baselines. It combines instance-level and global
explanations, adapting to each stakeholder's goals, whether understanding
individual decisions, assessing group-level bias, or evaluating robustness
under perturbations. We demonstrate the generality of our approach through two
case studies spanning six scenarios: binary credit risk classification and
financial time-series forecasting. H-XAI fills critical gaps left by existing
XAI methods by combining causal ratings and post-hoc explanations to answer
stakeholder-specific questions at both the individual decision level and the
overall model level.

Method: 构建包含2,186个几何问题的GeoLaux数据集，设计五维评估策略（答案正确性、过程正确性、过程质量、辅助线影响、错误原因）。

Result: 实验发现MLLMs在长步推理中性能显著下降，倾向于在证明问题中走捷径，且缺乏辅助线意识。

Conclusion: GeoLaux可作为评估MLLMs几何推理能力的基准，并指导能力提升。

Abstract: Geometry problem solving (GPS) requires models to master diagram
comprehension, logical reasoning, knowledge application, numerical computation,
and auxiliary line construction. This presents a significant challenge for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for
evaluating MLLM geometry skills overlook auxiliary line construction and lack
fine-grained process evaluation, making them insufficient for assessing MLLMs'
long-step reasoning abilities. To bridge these gaps, we present the GeoLaux
benchmark, comprising 2,186 geometry problems, incorporating both calculation
and proving questions. Notably, the problems require an average of 6.51
reasoning steps, with a maximum of 24 steps, and 41.8% of them need auxiliary
line construction. Building on the dataset, we design a novel five-dimensional
evaluation strategy assessing answer correctness, process correctness, process
quality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. Extensive experiments on 13
leading MLLMs (including thinking models and non-thinking models) yield three
pivotal findings: First, models exhibit substantial performance degradation in
extended reasoning steps (nine models demonstrate over 50% performance drop).
Second, compared to calculation problems, MLLMs tend to take shortcuts when
solving proving problems. Third, models lack auxiliary line awareness, and
enhancing this capability proves particularly beneficial for overall geometry
reasoning improvement. These findings establish GeoLaux as both a benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' long-step geometric reasoning with auxiliary lines and a
guide for capability advancement. Our dataset and code are included in
supplementary materials and will be released.

Abstract: We present HySemRAG, a framework that combines Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)
pipelines with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate large-scale

addresses limitations in existing RAG architectures through a multi-layered
approach: hybrid retrieval combining semantic search, keyword filtering, and
knowledge graph traversal; an agentic self-correction framework with iterative
quality assurance; and post-hoc citation verification ensuring complete
traceability. Our implementation processes scholarly literature through eight

retrieval, custom document layout analysis using modified Docling architecture,
bibliographic management, LLM-based field extraction, topic modeling, semantic
unification, and knowledge graph construction. The system creates dual data

Conclusion: ITDR数据集有效提升LLMs在推荐系统中的表现，并揭示了任务描述和数据规模的影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
natural language processing tasks. However, in the field of recommendation
systems, due to the structural differences between user behavior data and
natural language, LLMs struggle to effectively model the associations between
user preferences and items. Although prompt-based methods can generate
recommendation results, their inadequate understanding of recommendation tasks
leads to constrained performance. To address this gap, in this work, we
construct a sufficient instruction tuning dataset, ITDR, which encompasses 7
subtasks across two core root tasks--user-item interaction and user-item
understanding. The dataset integrates data from 13 public recommendation
datasets and is built using manually crafted standardized templates, comprising
approximately 200,000 instances. Experimental results demonstrate that ITDR
significantly enhances the performance of mainstream open-source LLMs such as
GLM-4, Qwen2.5, Qwen2.5-Instruct and LLaMA-3.2 on recommendation tasks.
Furthermore, we analyze the correlations between tasks and explore the impact
of task descriptions and data scale on instruction tuning effectiveness.
Finally, we perform comparative experiments against closed-source LLMs with
substantial parameters. Our tuning dataset ITDR and the fine-tuned large
recommendation models can be accessed at https://github.com/hellolzk/ITDR.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed growing interest in adopting large language
models (LLMs) for Register Transfer Level (RTL) code optimization. While
powerful cloud-based LLMs offer superior optimization capabilities, they pose
unacceptable intellectual property (IP) leakage risks when processing
proprietary hardware designs. In this paper, we propose a new scenario where
Verilog code must be optimized for specific attributes without leaking
sensitive IP information. We introduce the first IP-preserving edge-cloud
collaborative framework that leverages the benefits of both paradigms. Our
approach employs local small LLMs (e.g., Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B) to perform secure
comparative analysis between paired high-quality target designs and novice
draft codes, yielding general design principles that summarize key insights for
improvements. These principles are then used to query stronger cloud LLMs
(e.g., Deepseek-V3) for targeted code improvement, ensuring that only
abstracted and IP-safe guidance reaches external services. Our experimental
results demonstrate that the framework achieves significantly higher
optimization success rates compared to baseline methods. For example, combining
Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B and Deepseek-V3 achieves a 66.67\% optimization success rate
for power utilization, outperforming Deepseek-V3 alone (49.81\%) and even
commercial models like GPT-4o (55.81\%). Further investigation of local and
cloud LLM combinations reveals that different model pairings exhibit varying
strengths for specific optimization objectives, with interesting trends
emerging when varying the number of comparative code pairs. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for secure hardware design optimization that
balances performance gains with IP protection.

Conclusion: 中介引导的多代理协作可推动医疗多模态智能发展。

Abstract: Complex medical decision-making involves cooperative workflows operated by
different clinicians. Designing AI multi-agent systems can expedite and augment
human-level clinical decision-making. Existing multi-agent researches primarily
focus on language-only tasks, yet their extension to multimodal scenarios
remains challenging. A blind combination of diverse vision-language models
(VLMs) can amplify an erroneous outcome interpretation. VLMs in general are
less capable in instruction following and importantly self-reflection, compared
to large language models (LLMs) of comparable sizes. This disparity largely
constrains VLMs' ability in cooperative workflows. In this study, we propose
MedOrch, a mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration framework for medical
multimodal decision-making. MedOrch employs an LLM-based mediator agent that
enables multiple VLM-based expert agents to exchange and reflect on their
outputs towards collaboration. We utilize multiple open-source general-purpose
and domain-specific VLMs instead of costly GPT-series models, revealing the
strength of heterogeneous models. We show that the collaboration within
distinct VLM-based agents can surpass the capabilities of any individual agent.
We validate our approach on five medical vision question answering benchmarks,
demonstrating superior collaboration performance without model training. Our
findings underscore the value of mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration in
advancing medical multimodal intelligence. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Abstract: The versatility of large language models (LLMs) has been explored across
various sectors, but their application in healthcare poses challenges,
particularly in the domain of pharmaceutical contraindications where accurate

LLMs to address contraindications effectively by implementing a Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini as the base
model, and the text-embedding-3-small model for embeddings, our approach
integrates Langchain to orchestrate a hybrid retrieval system with re-ranking.
This system leverages Drug Utilization Review (DUR) data from public databases,
focusing on contraindications for specific age groups, pregnancy, and
concomitant drug use. The dataset includes 300 question-answer pairs across
three categories, with baseline model accuracy ranging from 0.49 to 0.57.
Post-integration of the RAG pipeline, we observed a significant improvement in
model accuracy, achieving rates of 0.94, 0.87, and 0.89 for contraindications
related to age groups, pregnancy, and concomitant drug use, respectively. The
results indicate that augmenting LLMs with a RAG framework can substantially
reduce uncertainty in prescription and drug intake decisions by providing more

Abstract: The surge in scientific publications challenges traditional review methods,

Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, combining graph queries
with vector search offer promise but are typically static, rely on proprietary
tools, and lack uncertainty estimates. We present an agentic approach that
encapsulates the hybrid RAG pipeline within an autonomous agent capable of (1)
dynamically selecting between GraphRAG and VectorRAG for each query, (2)
adapting instruction-tuned generation in real time to researcher needs, and (3)
quantifying uncertainty during inference. This dynamic orchestration improves
relevance, reduces hallucinations, and promotes reproducibility.
  Our pipeline ingests bibliometric open-access data from PubMed, arXiv, and
Google Scholar APIs, builds a Neo4j citation-based knowledge graph (KG), and
embeds full-text PDFs into a FAISS vector store (VS) using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2
model. A Llama-3.3-70B agent selects GraphRAG (translating queries to Cypher
for KG) or VectorRAG (combining sparse and dense retrieval with re-ranking).
Instruction tuning refines domain-specific generation, and bootstrapped
evaluation yields standard deviation for evaluation metrics.
  On synthetic benchmarks mimicking real-world queries, the Instruction-Tuned
Agent with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) outperforms the baseline,
achieving a gain of 0.63 in VS Context Recall and a 0.56 gain in overall
Context Precision. Additional gains include 0.24 in VS Faithfulness, 0.12 in
both VS Precision and KG Answer Relevance, 0.11 in overall Faithfulness score,

Abstract: Dynamic streams from news feeds, social media, sensor networks, and financial
markets challenge static RAG frameworks. Full-scale indices incur high memory
costs; periodic rebuilds introduce latency that undermines data freshness;
naive sampling sacrifices semantic coverage. We present Streaming RAG, a
unified pipeline that combines multi-vector cosine screening, mini-batch
clustering, and a counter-based heavy-hitter filter to maintain a compact
prototype set. We further prove an approximation bound \$E\[R(K\_t)] \ge R^\* -
L \Delta\$ linking retrieval quality to clustering variance. An incremental
index upsert mechanism refreshes prototypes without interrupting queries.
Experiments on eight real-time streams show statistically significant gains in
Recall\@10 (up to 3 points, p < 0.01), end-to-end latency below 15 ms, and
throughput above 900 documents per second under a 150 MB budget. Hyperparameter
sensitivity analysis over cluster count, admission probability, relevance
threshold, and counter capacity validates default settings. In open-domain
question answering with GPT-3.5 Turbo, we record 3.2-point gain in Exact Match
and 2.8-point gain in F1 on SQuAD; abstractive summarization yields ROUGE-L
improvements. Streaming RAG establishes a new Pareto frontier for retrieval

Abstract: Game theory has long served as a foundational tool in cybersecurity to test,
predict, and design strategic interactions between attackers and defenders. The
recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers new tools and challenges
for the security of computer systems; In this work, we investigate whether
classical game-theoretic frameworks can effectively capture the behaviours of
LLM-driven actors and bots. Using a reproducible framework for game-theoretic
LLM agents, we investigate two canonical scenarios -- the one-shot zero-sum
game and the dynamic Prisoner's Dilemma -- and we test whether LLMs converge to
expected outcomes or exhibit deviations due to embedded biases. Our experiments
involve four state-of-the-art LLMs and span five natural languages, English,
French, Arabic, Vietnamese, and Mandarin Chinese, to assess linguistic
sensitivity. For both games, we observe that the final payoffs are influenced
by agents characteristics such as personality traits or knowledge of repeated
rounds. Moreover, we uncover an unexpected sensitivity of the final payoffs to
the choice of languages, which should warn against indiscriminate application
of LLMs in cybersecurity applications and call for in-depth studies, as LLMs
may behave differently when deployed in different countries. We also employ
quantitative metrics to evaluate the internal consistency and cross-language
stability of LLM agents, to help guide the selection of the most stable LLMs
and optimising models for secure applications.

offensive security tasks, particularly for Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges.
We systematically investigate the key factors that drive agent success and
provide a detailed recipe for building effective LLM-based offensive security
agents. First, we present CTFJudge, a framework leveraging LLM as a judge to
analyze agent trajectories and provide granular evaluation across CTF solving
steps. Second, we propose a novel metric, CTF Competency Index (CCI) for
partial correctness, revealing how closely agent solutions align with
human-crafted gold standards. Third, we examine how LLM hyperparameters, namely
temperature, top-p, and maximum token length, influence agent performance and
automated cybersecurity task planning. For rapid evaluation, we present
CTFTiny, a curated benchmark of 50 representative CTF challenges across binary
exploitation, web, reverse engineering, forensics, and cryptography. Our
findings identify optimal multi-agent coordination settings and lay the
groundwork for future LLM agent research in cybersecurity. We make CTFTiny open
source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/CTFTiny along with CTFJudge on

Abstract: RL-based medical questionnaire systems have shown great potential in medical
scenarios. However, their safety and robustness remain unresolved. This study
performs a comprehensive evaluation on adversarial attack methods to identify
and analyze their potential vulnerabilities. We formulate the diagnosis process
as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the state is the patient responses
and unasked questions, and the action is either to ask a question or to make a
diagnosis. We implemented six prevailing major attack methods, including the
Fast Gradient Signed Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Carlini &
Wagner Attack (C&W) attack, Basic Iterative Method (BIM), DeepFool, and
AutoAttack, with seven epsilon values each. To ensure the generated adversarial
examples remain clinically plausible, we developed a comprehensive medical
validation framework consisting of 247 medical constraints, including
physiological bounds, symptom correlations, and conditional medical
constraints. We achieved a 97.6% success rate in generating clinically
plausible adversarial samples. We performed our experiment on the National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/), which
consists of 182,630 samples, to predict the participant's 4-year mortality
rate. We evaluated our attacks on the AdaptiveFS framework proposed in
arXiv:2004.00994. Our results show that adversarial attacks could significantly
impact the diagnostic accuracy, with attack success rates ranging from 33.08%
(FGSM) to 64.70% (AutoAttack). Our work has demonstrated that even under strict
medical constraints on the input, such RL-based medical questionnaire systems
still show significant vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Organisations are starting to adopt LLM-based AI agents, with their
deployments naturally evolving from single agents towards interconnected,
multi-agent networks. Yet a collection of safe agents does not guarantee a safe
collection of agents, as interactions between agents over time create emergent
behaviours and induce novel failure modes. This means multi-agent systems
require a fundamentally different risk analysis approach than that used for a
single agent.
  This report addresses the early stages of risk identification and analysis
for multi-agent AI systems operating within governed environments where
organisations control their agent configurations and deployment. In this
setting, we examine six critical failure modes: cascading reliability failures,
inter-agent communication failures, monoculture collapse, conformity bias,
deficient theory of mind, and mixed motive dynamics. For each, we provide a
toolkit for practitioners to extend or integrate into their existing frameworks
to assess these failure modes within their organisational contexts.
  Given fundamental limitations in current LLM behavioural understanding, our
approach centres on analysis validity, and advocates for progressively
increasing validity through staged testing across stages of abstraction and
deployment that gradually increases exposure to potential negative impacts,
while collecting convergent evidence through simulation, observational
analysis, benchmarking, and red teaming. This methodology establishes the
groundwork for robust organisational risk management as these LLM-based
multi-agent systems are deployed and operated.

Abstract: Understanding large-scale, complex software systems is a major challenge for
developers, who spend a significant portion of their time on program
comprehension. Traditional tools such as static visualizations and reverse
engineering techniques provide structural insights but often lack
interactivity, adaptability, and integration with contextual information.
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to
enhance code exploration workflows, yet their lack of grounding and integration
with structured views limits their effectiveness. This work introduces a hybrid
approach that integrates deterministic reverse engineering with LLM-guided,
intent-aware visual exploration. The proposed system combines UML-based
visualization, dynamic user interfaces, historical context, and collaborative
features into an adaptive tool for code comprehension. By interpreting user
queries and interaction patterns, the LLM helps developers navigate and
understand complex codebases more effectively. A prototype implementation for
Java demonstrates the feasibility of this approach. Future work includes
empirical evaluation, scaling to polyglot systems, and exploring GUI-driven LLM
interaction models. This research lays the groundwork for intelligent,
interactive environments that align with developer cognition and collaborative
workflows.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently demonstrated considerable
potential for repository-level code completion, as it integrates cross-file
knowledge with in-file preceding code to provide comprehensive contexts for
generation. To better understand the contribution of the retrieved cross-file
contexts, we introduce a likelihood-based metric to evaluate the impact of each
retrieved code chunk on the completion. Our analysis reveals that, despite
retrieving numerous chunks, only a small subset positively contributes to the
completion, while some chunks even degrade performance. To address this issue,
we leverage this metric to construct a repository-level dataset where each
retrieved chunk is labeled as positive, neutral, or negative based on its
relevance to the target completion. We then propose an adaptive retrieval
context filtering framework, CODEFILTER, trained on this dataset to mitigate
the harmful effects of negative retrieved contexts in code completion.
Extensive evaluation on the RepoEval and CrossCodeLongEval benchmarks
demonstrates that CODEFILTER consistently improves completion accuracy compared
to approaches without filtering operations across various tasks. Additionally,
CODEFILTER significantly reduces the length of the input prompt, enhancing
computational efficiency while exhibiting strong generalizability across
different models. These results underscore the potential of CODEFILTER to
enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and attributability of repository-level code
completion.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the
development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention,
particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to
perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a
specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied
navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given
their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of
such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of
safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack
strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting
a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation
technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and
robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in
embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation
strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of
verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to
provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development
of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the
findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety

Result: 在合成数据集上，KG方法在Complete Recall指标上达到91.85%，优于非KG基线方法的89.26%。

Conclusion: 知识图谱的结构信息为工具检索提供了补充信号，特别适用于需要顺序工具组合的查询。

Abstract: Effective tool retrieval is essential for AI agents to select from a vast
array of tools when identifying and planning actions in the context of complex
user queries. Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains
underexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on
similarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly
limits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests.
To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool
retrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and
their functional dependencies. Our retrieval algorithm leverages ensembles of
1-hop ego tool graphs to model direct and indirect connections between tools,
enabling more comprehensive and contextual tool selection for multi-step tasks.
We evaluate our approach on a synthetically generated internal dataset across
six defined user classes, extending previous work on coherent dialogue
synthesis and too retrieval benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our tool
graph-based method achieves 91.85% tool coverage on the micro-average Complete
Recall metric, compared to 89.26% for re-ranked semantic-lexical hybrid
retrieval, the strongest non-KG baseline in our experiments. These findings
support our hypothesis that the structural information in the KG provides
complementary signals to pure similarity matching, particularly for queries
requiring sequential tool composition.

Conclusion: 认知想象力是AI的下一个突破点，语义模型为其提供了可行工具。

Abstract: Cognitive imagination is a type of imagination that plays a key role in human
thinking. It is not a ``picture-in-the-head'' imagination. It is a faculty to
mentally visualize coherent and holistic systems of concepts and causal links
that serve as semantic contexts for reasoning, decision making and prediction.
Our position is that the role of cognitive imagination is still greatly
underestimated, and this creates numerous problems and diminishes the current
capabilities of AI. For instance, when reasoning, humans rely on imaginary
contexts to retrieve background info. They also constantly return to the
context for semantic verification that their reasoning is still reasonable.
Thus, reasoning without imagination is blind. This paper is a call for greater
attention to cognitive imagination as the next promising breakthrough in
artificial intelligence. As an instrument for simulating cognitive imagination,
we propose semantic models -- a new approach to mathematical models that can
learn, like neural networks, and are based on probabilistic causal
relationships. Semantic models can simulate cognitive imagination because they
ensure the consistency of imaginary contexts and implement a glass-box approach
that allows the context to be manipulated as a holistic and coherent system of
interrelated facts glued together with causal relations.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了假阴性问题，为CRS性能提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) enhance recommendation quality by
engaging users in multi-turn dialogues, capturing nuanced preferences through
natural language interactions. However, these systems often face the false
negative issue, where items that a user might like are incorrectly labeled as
negative during training, leading to suboptimal recommendations.Expanding the
label set through data augmentation presents an intuitive solution but faces
the challenge of balancing two key aspects: ensuring semantic relevance and
preserving the collaborative information inherent in CRS datasets. To address
these issues, we propose a novel data augmentation framework that first
leverages an LLM-based semantic retriever to identify diverse and semantically
relevant items, which are then filtered by a relevance scorer to remove noisy
candidates. Building on this, we introduce a two-stage training strategy
balancing semantic relevance and collaborative information. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets and user simulators demonstrate
significant and consistent performance improvements across various
recommenders, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in advancing CRS
performance.

Abstract: Active learning(AL), which serves as the representative label-efficient
learning paradigm, has been widely applied in resource-constrained scenarios.
The achievement of AL is attributed to acquisition functions, which are
designed for identifying the most important data to label. Despite this
success, one question remains unanswered: is AL safe? In this work, we
introduce ALA, a practical and the first framework to utilize the acquisition
function as the poisoning attack surface to reveal the weakness of active
learning. Specifically, ALA optimizes imperceptibly poisoned inputs to exhibit
high uncertainty scores, increasing their probability of being selected by
acquisition functions. To evaluate ALA, we conduct extensive experiments across
three datasets, three acquisition functions, and two types of clean-label
backdoor triggers. Results show that our attack can achieve high success rates
(up to 94%) even under low poisoning budgets (0.5%-1.0%) while preserving model
utility and remaining undetectable to human annotators. Our findings remind
active learning users: acquisition functions can be easily exploited, and
active learning should be deployed with caution in trusted data scenarios.

Conclusion: 研究表明动觉LLM训练在操作性技能学习中具有潜力。

Abstract: Operational skill learning, inherently physical and reliant on hands-on
practice and kinesthetic feedback, has yet to be effectively replicated in
large language model (LLM)-supported training. Current LLM training assistants
primarily generate customized textual feedback, neglecting the crucial
kinesthetic modality. This gap derives from the textual and uncertain nature of
LLMs, compounded by concerns on user acceptance of LLM driven body control. To
bridge this gap and realize the potential of collaborative human-LLM action,
this work explores human experience of LLM driven kinesthetic assistance.
Specifically, we introduced an "Align-Analyze-Adjust" strategy and developed
FlightAxis, a tool that integrates LLM with Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS)
for flight skill acquisition, a representative operational skill domain.
FlightAxis learns flight skills from manuals and guides forearm movements
during simulated flight tasks. Our results demonstrate high user acceptance of
LLM-mediated body control and significantly reduced task completion times.
Crucially, trainees reported that this kinesthetic assistance enhanced their
awareness of operation flaws and fostered increased engagement in the training
process, rather than relieving perceived load. This work demonstrated the
potential of kinesthetic LLM training in operational skill acquisition.

Abstract: Recent work on visual world models shows significant promise in latent state
dynamics obtained from pre-trained image backbones. However, most of the
current approaches are sensitive to training quality, requiring near-complete
coverage of the action and state space during training to prevent divergence
during inference. To make a model-based planning algorithm more robust to the
quality of the learned world model, we propose in this work to use a
variational autoencoder as a novelty detector to ensure that proposed action
trajectories during planning do not cause the learned model to deviate from the
training data distribution. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a
series of experiments in challenging simulated robot environments was carried
out, with the proposed method incorporated into a model-predictive control
policy loop extending the DINO-WM architecture. The results clearly show that
the proposed method improves over state-of-the-art solutions in terms of data
efficiency.

Abstract: Some of the strongest evidence that human minds should be thought about in
terms of symbolic systems has been the way they combine ideas, produce novelty,
and learn quickly. We argue that modern neural networks -- and the artificial
intelligence systems built upon them -- exhibit similar abilities. This
undermines the argument that the cognitive processes and representations used
by human minds are symbolic, although the fact that these neural networks are
typically trained on data generated by symbolic systems illustrates that such
systems play an important role in characterizing the abstract problems that
human minds have to solve. This argument leads us to offer a new agenda for
research on the symbolic basis of human thought.

Method: 提出CA-DL8.5算法，结合DL8.5的高效剪枝和缓存机制，通过模块化设计整合多种启发式和松弛机制。

Conclusion: CA-DL8.5为决策树学习提供了一个灵活且高效的框架，同时保持了最优性和完整性。

Abstract: Finding an optimal decision tree that minimizes classification error is known
to be NP-hard. While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic
programming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior
-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the
search is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space
exploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have
been proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not
been systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative
effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and
anytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some
existing anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous
approaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various
heuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm
reuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,
combined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning
criteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:
(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree
learning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search
strategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several
instantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k
heuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap
integral. Experimental results on standard classification benchmarks show that
CA-DL8.5 using LDS (limited discrepancy) consistently provides the best anytime
performance, outperforming both other CA-DL8.5 variants and the Blossom
algorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in perceiving complex
environments and making real-time decisions. Traditional modular approaches,
while offering interpretability, suffer from error propagation and coordination
issues, whereas end-to-end learning systems can simplify the design but face
computational bottlenecks. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous
driving using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that integrates bird's-eye view
(BEV) perception for enhanced real-time decision-making. We introduce the
\texttt{Mamba-BEV} model, an efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction
network that combines BEV-based perception with the Mamba framework for
temporal feature modeling. This integration allows the system to encode vehicle
surroundings and road features in a unified coordinate system and accurately
model long-range dependencies. Building on this, we propose the
\texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} framework, which utilizes the \texttt{Mamba-BEV} model as a
feature input for end-to-end DRL, achieving superior performance in dynamic
urban driving scenarios. We further enhance the interpretability of the model
by visualizing high-dimensional features through semantic segmentation,
providing insight into the learned representations. Extensive experiments on
the CARLA simulator demonstrate that \texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} outperforms existing
models across multiple metrics, including collision rate and trajectory
accuracy, offering a promising solution for real-time autonomous driving.

Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a complex optimization problem with
numerous real-world applications, mostly solved using metaheuristic algorithms
due to its $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard nature. Traditionally, these metaheuristics rely
on human-crafted designs developed through empirical studies. However, recent
research shows that machine learning methods can be used the structural
characteristics of solutions in combinatorial optimization, thereby aiding in
designing more efficient algorithms, particularly for solving VRP. Building on
this advancement, this study extends the previous research by conducting a
sensitivity analysis using multiple classifier models that are capable of
predicting the quality of VRP solutions. Hence, by leveraging explainable AI,
this research is able to extend the understanding of how these models make
decisions. Finally, our findings indicate that while feature importance varies,
certain features consistently emerge as strong predictors. Furthermore, we
propose a unified framework able of ranking feature impact across different
scenarios to illustrate this finding. These insights highlight the potential of
feature importance analysis as a foundation for developing a guidance mechanism
of metaheuristic algorithms for solving the VRP.

Conclusion: 模型不仅是系统的属性，还依赖于观察者的解释，为理解代理行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: In a classic paper, Conant and Ashby claimed that "every good regulator of a
system must be a model of that system." Artificial Life has produced many
examples of systems that perform tasks with apparently no model in sight; these
suggest Conant and Ashby's theorem doesn't easily generalise beyond its
restricted setup. Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be
fleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a
regulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having
"beliefs" about its environment, which it "updates" in response to sensory
input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more
sophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more
broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that
the observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere
property of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds
regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic
control theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the
model is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however,
and this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved.

Conclusion: 开发的KG可显著提升法律信息的可访问性，并为预测性司法工具提供重要知识支持。

Abstract: Legal decision-making process requires the availability of comprehensive and
detailed legislative background knowledge and up-to-date information on legal
cases and related sentences/decisions. Legal Knowledge Graphs (KGs) would be a
valuable tool to facilitate access to legal information, to be queried and
exploited for the purpose, and to enable advanced reasoning and machine
learning applications. Indeed, legal KGs may act as knowledge intensive
component to be used by pre-dictive machine learning solutions supporting the
decision process of the legal expert. Nevertheless, a few KGs can be found in
the legal domain. To fill this gap, we developed a legal KG targeting legal
cases of violence against women, along with clear adopted methodologies.
Specifically, the paper introduces two complementary approaches for automated
legal KG construction; a systematic bottom-up approach, customized for the
legal domain, and a new solution leveraging Large Language Models. Starting
from legal sentences publicly available from the European Court of Justice, the
solutions integrate structured data extraction, ontology development, and
semantic enrichment to produce KGs tailored for legal cases involving violence
against women. After analyzing and comparing the results of the two approaches,
the developed KGs are validated via suitable competency questions. The obtained
KG may be impactful for multiple purposes: can improve the accessibility to
legal information both to humans and machine, can enable complex queries and
may constitute an important knowledge component to be possibly exploited by
machine learning tools tailored for predictive justice.

Abstract: Making a good graphic that accurately and efficiently conveys the desired
message to the audience is both an art and a science, typically not taught in
the data science curriculum. Visualisation makeovers are exercises where the
community exchange feedback to improve charts and data visualizations. Can
multi-modal large language models (LLMs) emulate this task? Given a plot in the
form of an image file, or the code used to generate it, an LLM, primed with a
list of visualization best practices, is employed to semi-automatically
generate constructive criticism to produce a better plot. Our system is centred
around prompt engineering of a pre-trained model, relying on a combination of
userspecified guidelines and any latent knowledge of data visualization
practices that might lie within an LLMs training corpus. Unlike other works,
the focus is not on generating valid visualization scripts from raw data or
prompts, but on educating the user how to improve their existing data
visualizations according to an interpretation of best practices. A quantitative
evaluation is performed to measure the sensitivity of the LLM agent to various
plotting issues across different chart types. We make the tool available as a
simple self-hosted applet with an accessible Web interface.

Abstract: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) represent one of the largest
machine learning applications on the planet. Industry-scale DLRMs are trained
with petabytes of recommendation data to serve billions of users every day. To
utilize the rich user signals in the long user history, DLRMs have been scaled
up to unprecedented complexity, up to trillions of floating-point operations
(TFLOPs) per example. This scale, coupled with the huge amount of training
data, necessitates new storage and training algorithms to efficiently improve
the quality of these complex recommendation systems. In this paper, we present
a Request-Only Optimizations (ROO) training and modeling paradigm. ROO
simultaneously improves the storage and training efficiency as well as the
model quality of recommendation systems. We holistically approach this
challenge through co-designing data (i.e., request-only data), infrastructure
(i.e., request-only based data processing pipeline), and model architecture
(i.e., request-only neural architectures). Our ROO training and modeling
paradigm treats a user request as a unit of the training data. Compared with
the established practice of treating a user impression as a unit, our new
design achieves native feature deduplication in data logging, consequently
saving data storage. Second, by de-duplicating computations and communications
across multiple impressions in a request, this new paradigm enables highly
scaled-up neural network architectures to better capture user interest signals,
such as Generative Recommenders (GRs) and other request-only friendly
architectures.

Abstract: Research groups face persistent challenges in capturing, storing, and

much of a group's collective knowledge remains informal, fragmented, or
undocumented--often passed down orally through meetings, mentoring, and
day-to-day collaboration. This includes private resources such as emails,
meeting notes, training materials, and ad hoc documentation. Together, these
reflect the group's tacit knowledge--the informal, experience-based expertise
that underlies much of their work. Accessing this knowledge can be difficult,
requiring significant time and insider understanding. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) systems offer promising solutions by enabling users to query
and generate responses grounded in relevant source material. However, most
current RAG-LLM systems are oriented toward public documents and overlook the
privacy concerns of internal research materials. We introduce AquiLLM

Abstract: Many AI customer service systems use standard NLP pipelines or finetuned

detail-specific queries. This case study evaluates recent techniques: query
rewriting, RAG Fusion, keyword augmentation, intent recognition, and context
reranking, for building a robust customer support system in the electric power
domain. We compare vector-store and graph-based RAG frameworks, ultimately
selecting the graph-based RAG for its superior performance in handling complex
queries. We find that query rewriting improves retrieval for queries using
non-standard terminology or requiring precise detail. RAG Fusion boosts
performance on vague or multifaceted queries by merging multiple retrievals.
Reranking reduces hallucinations by filtering irrelevant contexts. Intent
recognition supports the decomposition of complex questions into more targeted
sub-queries, increasing both relevance and efficiency. In contrast, keyword
augmentation negatively impacts results due to biased keyword selection. Our
final system combines intent recognition, RAG Fusion, and reranking to handle
disambiguation and multi-source queries. Evaluated on both a GPT-4-generated
dataset and a real-world electricity provider FAQ dataset, it achieves 97.9%
and 89.6% accuracy respectively, substantially outperforming baseline RAG

assessment and a 96.53% Markdown TEDS score. This performance significantly
surpasses its Qwen2.5-VL-7B base model, larger-scale VLMs, and specialized
reasoning-enabled models. Compared to these self-hosted alternatives, it also
significantly reduces inference time. Furthermore, its accuracy exceeds that of
widely used proprietary models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash.
These results demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning provides an
effective and efficient method to bridge the gap between unstructured financial
documents and downstream automation, rivalling much larger and more general

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型难以捕捉语义意图和复杂行为动态，现有LLM解决方案在提示适应性和模态覆盖上有限。

Method: DMFI将原始日志转换为语义视图和行为抽象，分别用LoRA增强的LLM微调，并通过MLP模块融合输出。

Result: 在CERT数据集上，DMFI的检测准确率优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DMFI结合LLM语义推理与结构化行为建模，为内部威胁检测提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Insider threat detection (ITD) poses a persistent and high-impact challenge
in cybersecurity due to the subtle, long-term, and context-dependent nature of
malicious insider behaviors. Traditional models often struggle to capture
semantic intent and complex behavior dynamics, while existing LLM-based
solutions face limitations in prompt adaptability and modality coverage. To
bridge this gap, we propose DMFI, a dual-modality framework that integrates
semantic inference with behavior-aware fine-tuning. DMFI converts raw logs into
two structured views: (1) a semantic view that processes content-rich artifacts
(e.g., emails, https) using instruction-formatted prompts; and (2) a behavioral
abstraction, constructed via a 4W-guided (When-Where-What-Which) transformation
to encode contextual action sequences. Two LoRA-enhanced LLMs are fine-tuned
independently, and their outputs are fused via a lightweight MLP-based decision
module. We further introduce DMFI-B, a discriminative adaptation strategy that
separates normal and abnormal behavior representations, improving robustness
under severe class imbalance. Experiments on CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets
demonstrate that DMFI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection
accuracy. Our approach combines the semantic reasoning power of LLMs with
structured behavior modeling, offering a scalable and effective solution for
real-world insider threat detection. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of
combining LLM reasoning with structured behavioral modeling, offering a
scalable and deployable solution for modern insider threat detection.

Abstract: Generative AI has made image creation more accessible, yet aligning outputs
with nuanced creative intent remains challenging, particularly for non-experts.
Existing tools often require users to externalize ideas through prompts or
references, limiting fluid exploration. We introduce ThematicPlane, a system
that enables users to navigate and manipulate high-level semantic concepts
(e.g., mood, style, or narrative tone) within an interactive thematic design
plane. This interface bridges the gap between tacit creative intent and system
control. In our exploratory study (N=6), participants engaged in divergent and
convergent creative modes, often embracing unexpected results as inspiration or
iteration cues. While they grounded their exploration in familiar themes,
differing expectations of how themes mapped to outputs revealed a need for more
explainable controls. Overall, ThematicPlane fosters expressive, iterative
workflows and highlights new directions for intuitive, semantics-driven
interaction in generative design tools.

Abstract: Algorithmic systems such as search engines and information retrieval
platforms significantly influence academic visibility and the dissemination of
knowledge. Despite assumptions of neutrality, these systems can reproduce or
reinforce societal biases, including those related to gender. This paper
introduces and applies a bias-preserving definition of algorithmic gender
fairness, which assesses whether algorithmic outputs reflect real-world gender
distributions without introducing or amplifying disparities. Using a
heterogeneous dataset of academic profiles from German universities and
universities of applied sciences, we analyse gender differences in metadata
completeness, publication retrieval in academic databases, and visibility in
Google search results. While we observe no overt algorithmic discrimination,
our findings reveal subtle but consistent imbalances: male professors are
associated with a greater number of search results and more aligned publication
records, while female professors display higher variability in digital
visibility. These patterns reflect the interplay between platform algorithms,
institutional curation, and individual self-presentation. Our study highlights
the need for fairness evaluations that account for both technical performance
and representational equality in digital systems.

Abstract: Selecting third-party software packages in open-source ecosystems like Python
is challenging due to the large number of alternatives and limited transparent
evidence for comparison. Generative AI tools are increasingly used in
development workflows, but their suggestions often overlook dependency
evaluation, emphasize popularity over suitability, and lack reproducibility.
This creates risks for projects that require transparency, long-term
reliability, maintainability, and informed architectural decisions. This study
formulates software package selection as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making
(MCDM) problem and proposes a data-driven framework for technology evaluation.
Automated data pipelines continuously collect and integrate software metadata,
usage trends, vulnerability information, and developer sentiment from GitHub,
PyPI, and Stack Overflow. These data are structured into a decision model
representing relationships among packages, domain features, and quality
attributes. The framework is implemented in PySelect, a decision support system
that uses large language models to interpret user intent and query the model to
identify contextually appropriate packages. The approach is evaluated using
798,669 Python scripts from 16,887 GitHub repositories and a user study based
on the Technology Acceptance Model. Results show high data extraction
precision, improved recommendation quality over generative AI baselines, and
positive user evaluations of usefulness and ease of use. This work introduces a
scalable, interpretable, and reproducible framework that supports
evidence-based software selection using MCDM principles, empirical data, and
AI-assisted intent modeling.

Result: 在CERT数据集上，Log2Sig在准确率和F1分数上显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Log2Sig通过频率信号和行为序列的联合建模，为异常检测提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Insider threat detection presents a significant challenge due to the
deceptive nature of malicious behaviors, which often resemble legitimate user
operations. However, existing approaches typically model system logs as flat
event sequences, thereby failing to capture the inherent frequency dynamics and
multiscale disturbance patterns embedded in user behavior. To address these
limitations, we propose Log2Sig, a robust anomaly detection framework that
transforms user logs into multivariate behavioral frequency signals,
introducing a novel representation of user behavior. Log2Sig employs
Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to extract Intrinsic Mode
Functions (IMFs), which reveal behavioral fluctuations across multiple temporal
scales. Based on this, the model further performs joint modeling of behavioral
sequences and frequency-decomposed signals: the daily behavior sequences are
encoded using a Mamba-based temporal encoder to capture long-term dependencies,
while the corresponding frequency components are linearly projected to match
the encoder's output dimension. These dual-view representations are then fused
to construct a comprehensive user behavior profile, which is fed into a
multilayer perceptron for precise anomaly detection. Experimental results on
the CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets demonstrate that Log2Sig significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and F1 score.

a novel multi-faceted pretraining scheme that incorporates multiple pretraining
algorithms. This approach greatly enriched the embedding tables and resulted in
significant performance improvements. As a result, the multi-faceted large
embedding tables bring great performance gain on both the Click-Through Rate

serving infrastructure to overcome GPU memory limits and elevate the
scalability. This framework has been deployed in the Pinterest Ads system and

Abstract: The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), widespread
adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), and the growing frequency of extreme
weather events have significantly increased the complexity of power grid
planning, operation, and management. Traditional rule-based systems and
numerical optimization approaches often struggle with the scale, dynamics, and
adaptability required by modern power networks. This paper introduces
Grid-Agent, an autonomous, AI-driven framework that combines Large Language
Models (LLMs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and remediate
grid violations in real time. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with
numerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent
generates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers,
while a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness
via sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability,
Grid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that
dynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and
complexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through
optimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment
strategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE
69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation
performance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and
learning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse
network topologies. The autonomous nature of the framework makes it
particularly suitable for modern smart grid applications requiring rapid
response to dynamic operating conditions.

Abstract: Recent developments in diffusion- and flow- based models have significantly
advanced Text-to-Audio Generation (TTA). While achieving great synthesis
quality and controllability, current TTA systems still suffer from slow
inference speed, which significantly limits their practical applicability. This
paper presents MeanAudio, a novel MeanFlow-based model tailored for fast and
faithful text-to-audio generation. Built on a Flux-style latent transformer,
MeanAudio regresses the average velocity field during training, enabling fast
generation by mapping directly from the start to the endpoint of the flow
trajectory. By incorporating classifier-free guidance (CFG) into the training
target, MeanAudio incurs no additional cost in the guided sampling process. To
further stabilize training, we propose an instantaneous-to-mean curriculum with
flow field mix-up, which encourages the model to first learn the foundational
instantaneous dynamics, and then gradually adapt to mean flows. This strategy
proves critical for enhancing training efficiency and generation quality.
Experimental results demonstrate that MeanAudio achieves state-of-the-art
performance in single-step audio generation. Specifically, it achieves a real
time factor (RTF) of 0.013 on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090, yielding a 100x speedup
over SOTA diffusion-based TTA systems. Moreover, MeanAudio also demonstrates
strong performance in multi-step generation, enabling smooth and coherent
transitions across successive synthesis steps.

examining six commonly discussed AI catastrophic risks: CBRN, cyber offense,
sudden loss of control, gradual loss of control, environmental risk, and
geopolitical risk. First, we characterize these risks across seven key
dimensions, namely intent, competency, entity, polarity, linearity, reach, and
order. Next, we conduct risk pathway modeling by mapping step-by-step
progressions from the initial hazard to the resulting harms. The dimensional
approach supports systematic risk identification and generalizable mitigation
strategies, while risk pathway models help identify scenario-specific
interventions. Together, these methods offer a more structured and actionable
foundation for managing catastrophic AI risks across the value chain.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems have attracted increasing attention for
their improved performance by leveraging items' multimodal information. Prior
methods often build modality-specific item-item semantic graphs from raw
modality features and use them as supplementary structures alongside the
user-item interaction graph to enhance user preference learning. However, these
semantic graphs suffer from semantic deficiencies, including (1) insufficient
modeling of collaborative signals among items and (2) structural distortions
introduced by noise in raw modality features, ultimately compromising
performance. To address these issues, we first extract collaborative signals
from the interaction graph and infuse them into each modality-specific item
semantic graph to enhance semantic modeling. Then, we design a modulus-based
personalized embedding perturbation mechanism that injects perturbations with
modulus-guided personalized intensity into embeddings to generate contrastive
views. This enables the model to learn noise-robust representations through
contrastive learning, thereby reducing the effect of structural noise in
semantic graphs. Besides, we propose a dual representation alignment mechanism
that first aligns multiple semantic representations via a designed Anchor-based
InfoNCE loss using behavior representations as anchors, and then aligns
behavior representations with the fused semantics by standard InfoNCE, to
ensure representation consistency. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale datasets such as Open
X-Embodiment (OXE) demonstrate strong performance across a wide range of tasks.
However, they often struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of their
training data. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this
limited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the
reliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.
Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two
primary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within
individual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across
sub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the
inherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically
composed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied
environments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into
dataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the
generalization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios
where acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that
carefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce
shortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving
generalization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\pi_0$, in
both simulation and real-world environments. More information at

Abstract: Weighted model counting computes the sum of the rational-valued weights
associated with the satisfying assignments for a Boolean formula, where the
weight of an assignment is given by the product of the weights assigned to the
positive and negated variables comprising the assignment. Weighted model
counting finds applications across a variety of domains including probabilistic
reasoning and quantitative risk assessment.
  Most weighted model counting programs operate by (explicitly or implicitly)
converting the input formula into a form that enables arithmetic evaluation,
using multiplication for conjunctions and addition for disjunctions. Performing
this evaluation using floating-point arithmetic can yield inaccurate results,
and it cannot quantify the level of precision achieved. Computing with rational
arithmetic gives exact results, but it is costly in both time and space.
  This paper describes how to combine multiple numeric representations to
efficiently compute weighted model counts that are guaranteed to achieve a
user-specified precision. When all weights are nonnegative, we prove that the
precision loss of arithmetic evaluation using floating-point arithmetic can be
tightly bounded. We show that supplementing a standard IEEE double-precision
representation with a separate 64-bit exponent, a format we call extended-range
double (ERD), avoids the underflow and overflow issues commonly encountered in
weighted model counting. For problems with mixed negative and positive weights,
we show that a combination of interval floating-point arithmetic and rational
arithmetic can achieve the twin goals of efficiency and guaranteed precision.
For our evaluations, we have devised especially challenging formulas and weight
assignments, demonstrating the robustness of our approach.

Abstract: The Speaker Diarization and Recognition (SDR) task aims to predict "who spoke
when and what" within an audio clip, which is a crucial task in various
real-world multi-speaker scenarios such as meeting transcription and dialogue
systems. Existing SDR systems typically adopt a cascaded framework, combining
multiple modules such as speaker diarization (SD) and automatic speech
recognition (ASR). The cascaded systems suffer from several limitations, such
as error propagation, difficulty in handling overlapping speech, and lack of
joint optimization for exploring the synergy between SD and ASR tasks. To
address these limitations, we introduce SpeakerLM, a unified multimodal large
language model for SDR that jointly performs SD and ASR in an end-to-end
manner. Moreover, to facilitate diverse real-world scenarios, we incorporate a
flexible speaker registration mechanism into SpeakerLM, enabling SDR under
different speaker registration settings. SpeakerLM is progressively developed
with a multi-stage training strategy on large-scale real data. Extensive
experiments show that SpeakerLM demonstrates strong data scaling capability and
generalizability, outperforming state-of-the-art cascaded baselines on both
in-domain and out-of-domain public SDR benchmarks. Furthermore, experimental
results show that the proposed speaker registration mechanism effectively
ensures robust SDR performance of SpeakerLM across diverse speaker registration
conditions and varying numbers of registered speakers.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the
expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by relating them to logical
languages. This research has been been initialised by an influential result of
Barcel\'o et al. (2020), who showed that the graded modal logic (or a guarded
fragment of the logic C2), characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine GNNs. As a ``challenging open problem'' they left the
question whether full C2 characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine-readout GNNs. This question has remained unresolved despite
several attempts. In this paper, we solve the above open problem by proving
that the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine-readout GNNs strictly
exceeds that of C2. This result holds over both undirected and directed graphs.
Beyond its implications for GNNs, our work also leads to purely logical
insights on the expressive power of infinitary logics.

Abstract: Unifying probabilistic and logical learning is a key challenge in AI. We
introduce a Bayesian inductive logic programming approach that learns minimum
message length programs from noisy data. Our approach balances hypothesis
complexity and data fit through priors, which explicitly favour more general
programs, and a likelihood that favours accurate programs. Our experiments on
several domains, including game playing and drug design, show that our method
significantly outperforms previous methods, notably those that learn minimum
description length programs. Our results also show that our approach is
data-efficient and insensitive to example balance, including the ability to
learn from exclusively positive examples.

significant challenges in keeping pace with evolving cheating methods without
imposing invasive measures on users' systems. This paper presents
AntiCheatPT\_256, a transformer-based machine learning model designed to detect

this dataset, 90,707 context windows were created and subsequently augmented to
address class imbalance. The transformer model, trained on these windows,
achieved an accuracy of 89.17\% and an AUC of 93.36\% on an unaugmented test
set. This approach emphasizes reproducibility and real-world applicability,
offering a robust baseline for future research in data-driven cheat detection.

Conclusion: 研究为SHACL与OWL结合提供了理论和技术支持，但计算复杂度仍需优化。

Abstract: SHACL and OWL are two prominent W3C standards for managing RDF data. These
languages share many features, but they have one fundamental difference: OWL,
designed for inferring facts from incomplete data, makes the open-world
assumption, whereas SHACL is a constraint language that treats the data as
complete and must be validated under the closed-world assumption. The
combination of both formalisms is very appealing and has been called for, but
their semantic gap is a major challenge, semantically and computationally. In
this paper, we advocate a semantics for SHACL validation in the presence of
ontologies based on core universal models. We provide a technique for
constructing these models for ontologies in the rich data-tractable description
logic Horn-ALCHIQ. Furthermore, we use a finite representation of this model to
develop a rewriting technique that reduces SHACL validation in the presence of
ontologies to standard validation. Finally, we study the complexity of SHACL
validation in the presence of ontologies, and show that even very simple
ontologies make the problem EXPTIME-complete, and PTIME-complete in data
complexity.

Conclusion: SL@K具有理论保证、实现简单、计算高效、梯度稳定和噪声鲁棒性等优点。

Abstract: In the realm of recommender systems (RS), Top-$K$ ranking metrics such as
NDCG@$K$ are the gold standard for evaluating recommendation performance.
However, during the training of recommendation models, optimizing NDCG@$K$
poses significant challenges due to its inherent discontinuous nature and the
intricate Top-$K$ truncation. Recent efforts to optimize NDCG@$K$ have either
overlooked the Top-$K$ truncation or suffered from high computational costs and
training instability. To overcome these limitations, we propose SoftmaxLoss@$K$
(SL@$K$), a novel recommendation loss tailored for NDCG@$K$ optimization.
Specifically, we integrate the quantile technique to handle Top-$K$ truncation
and derive a smooth upper bound for optimizing NDCG@$K$ to address
discontinuity. The resulting SL@$K$ loss has several desirable properties,
including theoretical guarantees, ease of implementation, computational
efficiency, gradient stability, and noise robustness. Extensive experiments on
four real-world datasets and three recommendation backbones demonstrate that
SL@$K$ outperforms existing losses with a notable average improvement of 6.03%.

Abstract: Simulating glucose dynamics in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is
critical for developing personalized treatments and supporting data-driven
clinical decisions. Existing models often miss key physiological aspects and
are difficult to individualize. Here, we introduce physiologically-constrained
neural network (NN) digital twins to simulate glucose dynamics in T1D. To
ensure interpretability and physiological consistency, we first build a
population-level NN state-space model aligned with a set of ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) describing glucose regulation. This model is
formally verified to conform to known T1D dynamics. Digital twins are then
created by augmenting the population model with individual-specific models,
which include personal data, such as glucose management and contextual
information, capturing both inter- and intra-individual variability. We
validate our approach using real-world data from the T1D Exercise Initiative
study. Two weeks of data per participant were split into 5-hour sequences and
simulated glucose profiles were compared to observed ones. Clinically relevant
outcomes were used to assess similarity via paired equivalence t-tests with
predefined clinical equivalence margins. Across 394 digital twins, glucose
outcomes were equivalent between simulated and observed data: time in range
(70-180 mg/dL) was 75.1$\pm$21.2% (simulated) vs. 74.4$\pm$15.4% (real;
P<0.001); time below range (<70 mg/dL) 2.5$\pm$5.2% vs. 3.0$\pm$3.3% (P=0.022);
and time above range (>180 mg/dL) 22.4$\pm$22.0% vs. 22.6$\pm$15.9% (P<0.001).
Our framework can incorporate unmodeled factors like sleep and activity while
preserving key dynamics. This approach enables personalized in silico testing
of treatments, supports insulin optimization, and integrates physics-based and
data-driven modeling. Code: https://github.com/mosqueralopez/T1DSim_AI

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities continue to undermine the reliability and security
of modern systems, particularly as software complexity outpaces the
capabilities of traditional detection methods. This study introduces a genetic
algorithm-based method for test input generation that innovatively integrates
genetic operators and adaptive learning to enhance software vulnerability
detection. A key contribution is the application of the crossover operator,
which facilitates exploration by searching across a broader space of potential
test inputs. Complementing this, an adaptive feedback mechanism continuously
learns from the system's execution behavior and dynamically guides input
generation toward promising areas of the input space. Rather than relying on
fixed or randomly selected inputs, the approach evolves a population of
structurally valid test cases using feedback-driven selection, enabling deeper
and more effective code traversal. This strategic integration of exploration
and exploitation ensures that both diverse and targeted test inputs are
developed over time. Evaluation was conducted across nine open-source
JSON-processing libraries. The proposed method achieved substantial
improvements in coverage compared to a benchmark evolutionary fuzzing method,
with average gains of 39.8% in class coverage, 62.4% in method coverage, 105.0%
in line coverage, 114.0% in instruction coverage, and 166.0% in branch
coverage. These results highlight the method's capacity to detect deeper and

Abstract: The affective brain-computer interface is a crucial technology for affective
interaction and emotional intelligence, emerging as a significant area of
research in the human-computer interaction. Compared to single-type features,
multi-type EEG features provide a multi-level representation for analyzing
multi-dimensional emotions. However, the high dimensionality of multi-type EEG
features, combined with the relatively small number of high-quality EEG
samples, poses challenges such as classifier overfitting and suboptimal
real-time performance in multi-dimensional emotion recognition. Moreover,
practical applications of affective brain-computer interface frequently
encounters partial absence of multi-dimensional emotional labels due to the
open nature of the acquisition environment, and ambiguity and variability in
individual emotion perception. To address these challenges, this study proposes
a novel EEG feature selection method for missing multi-dimensional emotion
recognition. The method leverages adaptive orthogonal non-negative matrix
factorization to reconstruct the multi-dimensional emotional label space
through second-order and higher-order correlations, which could reduce the
negative impact of missing values and outliers on label reconstruction.
Simultaneously, it employs least squares regression with graph-based manifold
learning regularization and global feature redundancy minimization
regularization to enable EEG feature subset selection despite missing
information, ultimately achieving robust EEG-based multi-dimensional emotion
recognition. Simulation experiments on three widely used multi-dimensional
emotional datasets, DREAMER, DEAP and HDED, reveal that the proposed method
outperforms thirteen advanced feature selection methods in terms of robustness
for EEG emotional feature selection.

Conclusion: ASLSL能有效处理不完整多模态数据，提升情感识别性能。

Abstract: Recently, multi-modal physiological signals based emotion recognition has
garnered increasing attention in the field of brain-computer interfaces.
Nevertheness, the associated multi-modal physiological features are often
high-dimensional and inevitably include irrelevant, redundant, and noisy
representation, which can easily lead to overfitting, poor performance, and
high computational complexity in emotion classifiers. Feature selection has
been widely applied to address these challenges. However, previous studies
generally assumed that multi-modal physiological data are complete, whereas in
reality, the data are often incomplete due to the openness of the acquisition
and operational environment. For example, a part of samples are available in
several modalities but not in others. To address this issue, we propose a novel
method for incomplete multi-modal physiological signal feature selection called
adaptive shared latent structure learning (ASLSL). Based on the property that
similar features share similar emotional labels, ASLSL employs adaptive shared
latent structure learning to explore a common latent space shared for
incomplete multi-modal physiological signals and multi-dimensional emotional
labels, thereby mitigating the impact of missing information and mining
consensus information. Two most popular multi-modal physiological emotion
datasets (DEAP and DREAMER) with multi-dimensional emotional labels were
utilized to compare the performance between compare ASLSL and seventeen feature
selection methods. Comprehensive experimental results on these datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of ASLSL.

Abstract: Singing Voice Conversion (SVC) transfers a source singer's timbre to a target
while keeping melody and lyrics. The key challenge in any-to-any SVC is
adapting unseen speaker timbres to source audio without quality degradation.
Existing methods either face timbre leakage or fail to achieve satisfactory
timbre similarity and quality in the generated audio. To address these
challenges, we propose DAFMSVC, where the self-supervised learning (SSL)
features from the source audio are replaced with the most similar SSL features
from the target audio to prevent timbre leakage. It also incorporates a dual
cross-attention mechanism for the adaptive fusion of speaker embeddings,
melody, and linguistic content. Additionally, we introduce a flow matching
module for high quality audio generation from the fused features. Experimental
results show that DAFMSVC significantly enhances timbre similarity and
naturalness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and
objective evaluations.

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) offer a way to study the growth of
two-dimensional artificial organisms from a single seed cell. From the outset,
NCA-grown organisms have had issues with stability, their natural boundary
often breaking down and exhibiting tumour-like growth or failing to maintain
the expected shape. In this paper, we present a method for improving the
stability of NCA-grown organisms by introducing an 'identity' layer with simple
constraints during training.
  Results show that NCAs grown in close proximity are more stable compared with
the original NCA model. Moreover, only a single identity value is required to
achieve this increase in stability. We observe emergent movement from the
stable organisms, with increasing prevalence for models with multiple identity
values.
  This work lays the foundation for further study of the interaction between
NCA-grown organisms, paving the way for studying social interaction at a
cellular level in artificial organisms.

Abstract: Committee-selection problems arise in many contexts and applications, and
there has been increasing interest within the social choice research community
on identifying which properties are satisfied by different multi-winner voting
rules. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework to evaluate how
frequently voting rules violate axioms across diverse preference distributions
in practice, shifting away from the binary perspective of axiom satisfaction
given by worst-case analysis. Using this framework, we analyze the relationship
between multi-winner voting rules and their axiomatic performance under several
preference distributions. We then show that neural networks, acting as voting
rules, can outperform traditional rules in minimizing axiom violations. Our
results suggest that data-driven approaches to social choice can inform the
design of new voting systems and support the continuation of data-driven
research in social choice.

Abstract: We study the problem of fair division of a set of indivisible goods with
connectivity constraints. Specifically, we assume that the goods are
represented as vertices of a connected graph, and sets of goods allocated to
the agents are connected subgraphs of this graph. We focus on the
widely-studied maximin share criterion of fairness. It has been shown that an
allocation satisfying this criterion may not exist even without connectivity
constraints, i.e., if the graph of goods is complete. In view of this, it is
natural to seek approximate allocations that guarantee each agent a connected
bundle of goods with value at least a constant fraction of the maximin share
value to the agent. It is known that for some classes of graphs, such as
complete graphs, cycles, and $d$-claw-free graphs for any fixed $d$, such
approximate allocations indeed exist. However, it is an open problem whether
they exist for the class of all graphs.
  In this paper, we continue the systematic study of the existence of
approximate allocations on restricted graph classes. In particular, we show
that such allocations exist for several well-studied classes, including block
graphs, cacti, complete multipartite graphs, and split graphs.

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) ranks among the most frequently diagnosed cancers and is one
of the most common causes of death for men and women worldwide. Computed
Tomography (CT) images are the most preferred diagnosis method because of their
low cost and their faster processing times. Many researchers have proposed
various ways of identifying lung cancer using CT images. However, such
techniques suffer from significant false positives, leading to low accuracy.
The fundamental reason results from employing a small and imbalanced dataset.
This paper introduces an innovative approach for LC detection and
classification from CT images based on the DenseNet201 model. Our approach
comprises several advanced methods such as Focal Loss, data augmentation, and
regularization to overcome the imbalanced data issue and overfitting challenge.
The findings show the appropriateness of the proposal, attaining a promising
performance of 98.95% accuracy.

Motivation: 微调LLMs可能导致模型在目标领域外表现出有害行为，即使微调数据本身无害。研究旨在为API提供实用的训练保障措施。

Method: 研究了四种干预方法：1) KL散度正则化；2) 特征空间的ℓ2距离；3) 安全子空间投影（SafeLoRA）；4) 混合少量安全训练数据。

Conclusion: 讨论了突发性不对齐研究的开放性问题。

Abstract: Fine-tuning lets practitioners repurpose aligned large language models (LLMs)
for new domains, yet recent work reveals emergent misalignment (EMA): Even a
small, domain-specific fine-tune can induce harmful behaviors far outside the
target domain. Even in the case where model weights are hidden behind a
fine-tuning API, this gives attackers inadvertent access to a broadly
misaligned model in a way that can be hard to detect from the fine-tuning data
alone. We present the first systematic study of in-training safeguards against
EMA that are practical for providers who expose fine-tuning via an API. We
investigate four training regularization interventions: (i) KL-divergence
regularization toward a safe reference model, (ii) $\ell_2$ distance in feature
space, (iii) projecting onto a safe subspace (SafeLoRA), and (iv) interleaving
of a small amount of safe training examples from a general instruct-tuning
dataset. We first evaluate the methods' emergent misalignment effect across
four malicious, EMA-inducing tasks. Second, we assess the methods' impacts on
benign tasks. We conclude with a discussion of open questions in emergent
misalignment research.

Result: 在多个模型上，S-GRPO显著优于GRPO，性能提升2.2%-2.5%，并在20%合成噪声下保持稳定学习。

Conclusion: S-GRPO为大规模推理模型的训练提供了更稳健和有效的方法。

Abstract: Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a key technique for training
large reasoning models, yet it suffers from a critical vulnerability: the
\emph{Think-Answer Mismatch}, where noisy reward signals corrupt the learning
process. This problem is most severe in unbalanced response groups,
paradoxically degrading the signal precisely when it should be most
informative. To address this challenge, we propose Stable Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (S-GRPO), a principled enhancement that derives optimal,
noise-aware advantage weights to stabilize training. Our comprehensive
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate S-GRPO's
effectiveness and robustness. On various models, S-GRPO significantly
outperforms DR. GRPO, achieving performance gains of +2.5% on
Qwen-Math-7B-Base, +2.2% on Llama-3.2-3B-Base, and +2.4% on
Qwen-Math-1.5B-Instruct. Most critically, while standard GRPO fails to learn
under 20% synthetic reward noise, S-GRPO maintains stable learning progress.
These results highlight S-GRPO's potential for more robust and effective
training of large-scale reasoning models. \footnote{Code and data are available

Abstract: In the domain of scientific machine learning, designing effective reward
functions remains a challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in
environments where task goals are difficult to specify numerically. Reward
functions in existing work are predominantly based on heuristics, manual
engineering, or task-specific tuning. In this work, we introduce a semantically
aligned reinforcement learning method where rewards are computed by aligning
the current state with a target semantic instruction using a
Sentence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT).
Instead of relying on manually defined reward functions, the policy receives
feedback based on the reward, which is a cosine similarity between the goal
textual description and the statement description in the episode. We evaluated
our approach in several environments and showed that semantic reward can guide
learning to achieve competitive control behavior, even in the absence of
hand-crafted reward functions. Our study demonstrates a correlation between the
language embedding space and the conventional Euclidean space. This framework
opens new horizons for aligning agent behavior with natural language goals and
lays the groundwork for a more seamless integration of larger language models
(LLMs) and fluid control applications.

Conclusion: ASAP为构建高效且强大的大型推理模型（LRMs）提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in code reasoning by scaling up the length of Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, excessively long reasoning traces introduce substantial
challenges in terms of training cost, inference latency, and deployment
feasibility. While various CoT compression approaches have emerged to address
this challenge, they face inherent trade-offs: token-level methods often
disrupt syntactic and logical coherence, while step-level methods based on
perplexity fail to reliably capture the logically critical reasoning steps. In
this paper, we propose ASAP (Anchor-guided, Surprisal-based Pruning), a novel
coarse-to-fine framework for CoT compression. ASAP first performs anchor-guided
pruning to preserve the core reasoning structure, which efficiently reduces the
search space for subsequent processing. It then enables a logic-aware pruning
by selecting logically essential reasoning steps based on a novel first-token
surprisal metric. Finally, ASAP teaches models to autonomously generate and
leverage these concise CoTs at inference time, enabling efficient reasoning in
coding tasks. Experiments show that ASAP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
across multiple code generation benchmarks while substantially reducing
training and inference costs. On the challenging LiveCodeBench v4_v5 benchmark,
our approach reduces token generation by 23.5% and inference latency by 43.5%
compared to the strongest baseline, while achieving a competitive accuracy of
36.19% in Pass@1. Our results highlight a promising direction for building
powerful and efficient LRMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code generation and structured reasoning; however, their performance often
degrades on complex tasks that require consistent multi-step planning. Recent
work has explored combining LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), yet
existing approaches primarily focus on generating heuristic-based code for
optimization or target simpler tasks where correctness alone is sufficient. In
this work, we propose MCTS-OPS, a novel neural-symbolic framework that
formulates prompt selection as a sequential decision process guided by MCTS.
Our method explores and refines multi-step prompt sequences for the goal of
improving code generation quality and enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of LLMs in general optimization. Experiments on network
optimization show significant improvement over the baselines, both in the
success rate of executing the generated code and in the optimization results
with the specified objective and constraints (2$\sim$4$\times$ higher reward
and 3$\times$ lower standard deviation). Moreover, it improves the chance of
attaining the optimal solution by about 10\% of cases, compared to baseline
methods in hard problems. These results highlight the promise of combining
symbolic planning with LLMs for robust, high-quality code generation in complex

Conclusion: DP-LLM 提供了一种高效的方法，动态调整模型精度以适应不同运行时需求。

Abstract: How can we effectively handle queries for on-device large language models
(LLMs) with varying runtime constraints, such as latency and accuracy?
Multi-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient
runtime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model
variants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question
still remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a
target precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution,
we take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of
each layer dynamically changes across decoding iterations. Building on this
insight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns
precision to each layer based on input values. DP-LLM augments each linear
layer in an LLM with a precision selector that determines the bitwidth at
runtime using a lightweight error estimator and threshold values learned
through fine-tuning. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks
demonstrate that DP-LLM achieves a superior performance-latency trade-off,
outperforming prior approaches.

Result: 评估14个主流LLMs，发现任务复杂度增加时欺骗倾向上升。

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂任务中表现出自发性欺骗倾向，对其在关键领域的部署提出警示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in reasoning,
planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness a critical
concern. The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately
fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a
significant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such
deception by explicitly setting a "hidden" objective through prompting or
fine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.
Moving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated
deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this
evaluation, we propose a novel framework using "contact searching questions."
This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological
principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive
Intention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The
second, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's
internal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we
find that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in
parallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a
mathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the
most advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when
handling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM
agents in complex and crucial domains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in post-training Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and preference optimization
methods, are key drivers for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However,
these methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility
to primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy
quality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we
introduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful
plugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based
optimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay
number, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the
risk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a
periodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network
plasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective,
combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further
bolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR
significantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods
on both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative
DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging
math tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based
algorithms. These findings highlight that LoRR offers a practical,
sample-efficient, and highly effective paradigm for LLM finetuning, unlocking
greater performance from limited data.

Result: 在多个运动和控制任务中，RPO表现出更高的样本效率和更强的性能。

Conclusion: RPO是一种稳定且高效的RPG方法，适用于需要样本重用和稳定训练的场景。

Abstract: Reparameterization policy gradient (RPG) is promising for improving sample
efficiency by leveraging differentiable dynamics. However, a critical barrier
is its training instability, where high-variance gradients can destabilize the
learning process. To address this, we draw inspiration from Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), which uses a surrogate objective to enable stable sample
reuse in the model-free setting. We first establish a connection between this
surrogate objective and RPG, which has been largely unexplored and is
non-trivial. Then, we bridge this gap by demonstrating that the
reparameterization gradient of a PPO-like surrogate objective can be computed
efficiently using backpropagation through time. Based on this key insight, we
propose Reparameterization Proximal Policy Optimization (RPO), a stable and
sample-efficient RPG-based method. RPO enables multiple epochs of stable sample
reuse by optimizing a clipped surrogate objective tailored for RPG, while being
further stabilized by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization and
remaining fully compatible with existing variance reduction methods. We
evaluate RPO on a suite of challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks, where
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample efficiency and
strong performance.

Abstract: Textual Attribute Graphs (TAGs) are critical for modeling complex networks

due to difficulties in integrating rich semantics from text with structural

domain-specific terminology, modeling long-range dependencies, adapting to
temporal evolution, and scaling to massive datasets. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework that integrates TAPE (Text-Attributed Graph
Representation Enhancement) with Graphormer. Our approach leverages a large
language model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT, within the TAPE framework to
generate semantically rich explanations from paper content, which are then
fused into enhanced node representations. These embeddings are combined with
structural features using a novel integration layer with learned attention
weights. Graphormer's path-aware position encoding and multi-head attention
mechanisms are employed to effectively capture long-range dependencies across
the citation network. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on the
challenging ogbn-arxiv dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a
classification accuracy of 0.772, significantly surpassing the best GCN
baseline of 0.713. Our method also yields strong results in precision (0.671),
recall (0.577), and F1-score (0.610). We validate our approach through
comprehensive ablation studies that quantify the contribution of each
component, demonstrating the synergy between semantic and structural
information. Our framework provides a scalable and robust solution for node
classification in dynamic TAGs, offering a promising direction for future
research in knowledge systems and scientific discovery.

mixing an ego agent's policy with biased random behaviours and scores them
using a variance-based learnability metric that prioritises partners near the
ego agent's current learning frontier. We show that UPD can be integrated with
unsupervised environment design, resulting in the first method enabling fully
unsupervised curricula over both level and partner distributions in a
cooperative setting. Through extensive evaluations on Overcooked-AI and the
Overcooked Generalisation Challenge, we demonstrate that this dynamic partner
curriculum is highly effective: UPD consistently outperforms both
population-based and population-free baselines as well as ablations. In a user
study, we further show that UPD achieves higher returns than all baselines and
was perceived as significantly more adaptive, more human-like, a better
collaborator, and less frustrating.

Conclusion: 提出的三阶段框架有效解决了多数据库场景下的目标数据库识别问题，并提升了SQL生成质量。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database
language, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases.
Traditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a
given Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances
in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation
accuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is
pre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive
databases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet
overlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL
framework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL
queries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit
information from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We
then train a large db\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based
finetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\_id) based on
both the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL
by using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database
intent prediction and SQL generation accuracy.

Abstract: Across scientific domains, a fundamental challenge is to characterize and
compute the mappings from underlying physical processes to observed signals and
measurements. While nonlinear neural networks have achieved considerable
success, they remain theoretically opaque, which hinders adoption in contexts
where interpretability is paramount. In contrast, linear neural networks serve
as a simple yet effective foundation for gaining insight into these complex
relationships. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework for
analyzing linear encoder-decoder architectures through the lens of Bayes risk
minimization for solving data-driven scientific machine learning problems. We
derive closed-form, rank-constrained linear and affine linear optimal mappings
for forward modeling and inverse recovery tasks. Our results generalize
existing formulations by accommodating rank-deficiencies in data, forward
operators, and measurement processes. We validate our theoretical results by
conducting numerical experiments on datasets from simple biomedical imaging,
financial factor analysis, and simulations involving nonlinear fluid dynamics
via the shallow water equations. This work provides a robust baseline for
understanding and benchmarking learned neural network models for scientific

Abstract: Quantization is usually regarded as a means to trade quality of performance
for reduced compute requirements, i.e., as a suboptimal approximation. However,
if examined in terms of a fixed overall resource budget, a very different
perspective arises. We introduce Signed-Zero Ternary (SZT), a 2-bit
quantization that deterministically provides gradient information with no
forward-path penalty. Our analysis provides evidence that it may improve
information density compared to non-quantized alternatives.

Motivation: 离线强化学习面临分布偏移问题，导致OOD动作和高估。现有方法要么过于保守，要么性能不足，需要一种平衡两者的解决方案。

Method: 提出MCRE框架，结合TD误差和行为克隆项；开发MCRQ算法，将MCRE整合到离线策略的actor-critic框架中。

Result: MCRQ在基准数据集上优于现有基线方法和最先进的离线RL算法。

Conclusion: MCRE和MCRQ有效平衡了保守性和性能，为离线RL提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to learn optimal policies from
static datasets without further environment interaction. A key challenge is the
distribution shift between the learned and behavior policies, leading to
out-of-distribution (OOD) actions and overestimation. To prevent gross
overestimation, the value function must remain conservative; however, excessive
conservatism may hinder performance improvement. To address this, we propose
the mildly conservative regularized evaluation (MCRE) framework, which balances
conservatism and performance by combining temporal difference (TD) error with a
behavior cloning term in the Bellman backup. Building on this, we develop the
mildly conservative regularized Q-learning (MCRQ) algorithm, which integrates
MCRE into an off-policy actor-critic framework. Experiments show that MCRQ
outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms on
benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非线性固定点方程算法（如Q学习和TD学习）在参数无关最优收敛速率方面的长期挑战。

Method: 通过将平均误差重新构造为涉及非线性扰动的线性递归，并利用半范数收缩与诱导范数的单调性结合来控制非线性。

Result: 首次实现了参数无关的$\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$最优收敛速率，适用于平均奖励和指数折扣场景的Q学习。

Conclusion: 该方法为Q学习提供了广泛适用的最优收敛速率解决方案，支持同步/异步更新、单/多代理部署及多种数据来源。

Abstract: Algorithms for solving \textit{nonlinear} fixed-point equations -- such as
average-reward \textit{$Q$-learning} and \textit{TD-learning} -- often involve
semi-norm contractions. Achieving parameter-free optimal convergence rates for
these methods via Polyak--Ruppert averaging has remained elusive, largely due
to the non-monotonicity of such semi-norms. We close this gap by (i.) recasting
the averaged error as a linear recursion involving a nonlinear perturbation,
and (ii.) taming the nonlinearity by coupling the semi-norm's contraction with
the monotonicity of a suitably induced norm. Our main result yields the first
parameter-free $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ optimal rates for $Q$-learning in both
average-reward and exponentially discounted settings, where $t$ denotes the
iteration index. The result applies within a broad framework that accommodates
synchronous and asynchronous updates, single-agent and distributed deployments,
and data streams obtained either from simulators or along Markovian
trajectories.

Conclusion: MRAD解决了部分特征场景下的成员推理问题，兼容多种异常检测技术。

Abstract: Machine learning models have been shown to be susceptible to membership
inference attack, which can be used to determine whether a given sample appears
in the training data. Existing membership inference methods commonly assume
that the adversary has full access to the features of the target sample. This
assumption, however, does not hold in many real-world scenarios where only
partial features information is available, thereby limiting the applicability
of these methods. In this work, we study an inference scenario where the
adversary observes only partial features of each sample and aims to infer
whether this observed subset was present in the training set of the target
model. We define this problem as Partial Feature Membership Inference (PFMI).
To address this problem, we propose MRAD (Memory-guided Reconstruction and
Anomaly Detection), a two-stage attack framework. In the first stage, MRAD
optimizes the unknown feature values to minimize the loss of the sample. In the
second stage, it measures the deviation between the reconstructed sample and
the training distribution using anomaly detection. Empirical results
demonstrate that MRAD is effective across a range of datasets, and maintains
compatibility with various off-the-shelf anomaly detection techniques. For
example, on STL-10, our attack achieves an AUC of around 0.6 even with 40% of
the missing features.

Abstract: Generative models, especially diffusion and flow-based models, have been
promising in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, integrating
powerful generative models into this framework poses unique challenges. In
particular, diffusion and flow-based policies suffer from low sampling
efficiency due to their iterative generation processes, making them impractical
in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. To tackle these
difficulties, we propose OM2P (Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy), a novel
offline MARL algorithm to achieve efficient one-step action sampling. To
address the misalignment between generative objectives and reward maximization,
we introduce a reward-aware optimization scheme that integrates a
carefully-designed mean-flow matching loss with Q-function supervision.
Additionally, we design a generalized timestep distribution and a
derivative-free estimation strategy to reduce memory overhead and improve
training stability. Empirical evaluations on Multi-Agent Particle and MuJoCo
benchmarks demonstrate that OM2P achieves superior performance, with up to a
3.8x reduction in GPU memory usage and up to a 10.8x speed-up in training time.
Our approach represents the first to successfully integrate mean-flow model
into offline MARL, paving the way for practical and scalable generative
policies in cooperative multi-agent settings.

Abstract: The preservation of privacy has emerged as a critical topic in the era of
artificial intelligence. However, current work focuses on user-oriented
privacy, overlooking severe enterprise data leakage risks exacerbated by the
Retrieval-Augmented Generation paradigm. To address this gap, our paper
introduces a novel objective: enterprise-oriented privacy concerns. Achieving
this objective requires overcoming two fundamental challenges: existing methods
such as data sanitization severely degrade model performance, and the field
lacks public datasets for evaluation. We address these challenges with several
solutions. (1) To prevent performance degradation, we propose ABack, a
training-free mechanism that leverages a Hidden State Model to pinpoint the
origin of a leakage intention and rewrite the output safely. (2) To solve the
lack of datasets, we construct PriGenQA, a new benchmark for enterprise privacy
scenarios in healthcare and finance. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, we move
beyond simple static attacks by developing a powerful adaptive attacker with
Group Relative Policy Optimization. Experiments show that against this superior
adversary, ABack improves the overall privacy utility score by up to 15\% over
strong baselines, avoiding the performance trade-offs of prior methods.

Conclusion: eSASRec简单易集成，可作为新兴复杂算法的强基线。

Abstract: Since their introduction, Transformer-based models, such as SASRec and
BERT4Rec, have become common baselines for sequential recommendations,
surpassing earlier neural and non-neural methods. A number of following
publications have shown that the effectiveness of these models can be improved
by, for example, slightly updating the architecture of the Transformer layers,
using better training objectives, and employing improved loss functions.
However, the additivity of these modular improvements has not been
systematically benchmarked - this is the gap we aim to close in this paper.
Through our experiments, we identify a very strong model that uses SASRec's
training objective, LiGR Transformer layers, and Sampled Softmax Loss. We call
this combination eSASRec (Enhanced SASRec). While we primarily focus on
realistic, production-like evaluation, in our preliminarily study we find that
common academic benchmarks show eSASRec to be 23% more effective compared to
the most recent state-of-the-art models, such as ActionPiece. In our main
production-like benchmark, eSASRec resides on the Pareto frontier in terms of
the accuracy-coverage tradeoff (alongside the recent industrial models HSTU and
FuXi. As the modifications compared to the original SASRec are relatively
straightforward and no extra features are needed (such as timestamps in HSTU),
we believe that eSASRec can be easily integrated into existing recommendation
pipelines and can can serve as a strong yet very simple baseline for emerging
complicated algorithms. To facilitate this, we provide the open-source
implementations for our models and benchmarks in repository

Conclusion: 该方法在优化燃料消耗和碰撞风险之间取得了有效平衡，优于传统固定时间策略。

Abstract: This work presents a Markov decision process (MDP) framework to model
decision-making for collision avoidance maneuver (CAM) and a reinforcement
learning policy gradient (RL-PG) algorithm to train an autonomous guidance
policy using historic CAM data. In addition to maintaining acceptable collision
risks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by
making early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete
action and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when
to initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for
conjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The
Markov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the
reliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which
increases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked
conjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation
study on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction
events, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average
propellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy
that initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On
historical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant
overall but reduces the average propellant consumption per CAM. For both
historical and synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy achieves equal
if not higher overall collision risk guarantees.

Abstract: Accuracy in neural PDE solvers often breaks down not because of limited
expressivity, but due to poor optimisation caused by ill-conditioning,
especially in multi-fidelity and stiff problems. We study this issue in
Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs), a convex variant of neural
PDE solvers, and show that asymptotic components in governing equations can
produce highly ill-conditioned activation matrices, severely limiting
convergence. We introduce Shifted Gaussian Encoding, a simple yet effective
activation filtering step that increases matrix rank and expressivity while
preserving convexity. Our method extends the solvable range of Peclet numbers
in steady advection-diffusion equations by over two orders of magnitude,
achieves up to six orders lower error on multi-frequency function learning, and
fits high-fidelity image vectors more accurately and faster than deep networks
with over a million parameters. This work highlights that conditioning, not
depth, is often the bottleneck in scientific neural solvers and that simple
architectural changes can unlock substantial gains.

Conclusion: MAB方法为决策树剪枝提供了一种动态且概率化的优化途径。

Abstract: Decision trees, without appropriate constraints, can easily become overly
complex and prone to overfit, capturing noise rather than generalizable
patterns. To resolve this problem,pruning operation is a crucial part in
optimizing decision trees, as it not only reduces the complexity of trees but
also decreases the probability of generating overfit models. The conventional
pruning techniques like Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP) and Reduced Error Pruning
(REP) are mostly based on greedy approaches that focus on immediate gains in
performance while pruning nodes of the decision tree. However, this might
result in a lower generalization in the long run, compromising the robust
ability of the tree model when introduced to unseen data samples, particularly
when trained with small and complex datasets. To address this challenge, we are
proposing a Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)-based pruning approach, a reinforcement
learning (RL)-based technique, that will dynamically prune the tree to generate
an optimal decision tree with better generalization. Our proposed approach
assumes the pruning process as an exploration-exploitation problem, where we
are utilizing the MAB algorithms to find optimal branch nodes to prune based on
feedback from each pruning actions. Experimental evaluation on several
benchmark datasets, demonstrated that our proposed approach results in better
predictive performance compared to the traditional ones. This suggests the
potential of utilizing MAB for a dynamic and probabilistic way of decision tree
pruning, in turn optimizing the decision tree-based model.

Abstract: Deep temporal architectures such as Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs)
achieve strong predictive performance on sequential data, yet theoretical
understanding of their generalization remains limited. We address this gap by
providing both the first non-vacuous, architecture-aware generalization bounds
for deep temporal models and a principled evaluation methodology.
  For exponentially $\beta$-mixing sequences, we derive bounds scaling as $
O\!\Bigl(R\,\sqrt{\tfrac{D\,p\,n\,\log N}{N}}\Bigr), $ where $D$ is network
depth, $p$ kernel size, $n$ input dimension, and $R$ weight norm. Our
delayed-feedback blocking mechanism transforms dependent samples into
effectively independent ones while discarding only $O(1/\log N)$ of the data,
yielding $\sqrt{D}$ scaling instead of exponential, implying that doubling
depth requires approximately quadrupling the training data.
  We also introduce a fair-comparison methodology that fixes the effective
sample size to isolate the effect of temporal structure from information
content. Under $N_{\text{eff}}=2{,}000$, strongly dependent sequences
($\rho=0.8$) exhibit $\approx76\%$ smaller generalization gaps than weakly
dependent ones ($\rho=0.2$), challenging the intuition that dependence is
purely detrimental. Yet convergence rates diverge from theory: weak
dependencies follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-1.21}$ scaling and strong dependencies
follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-0.89}$, both steeper than the predicted $N^{-0.5}$.
These findings reveal that temporal dependence can enhance learning under fixed
information budgets, while highlighting gaps between theory and practice that
motivate future research.

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) with sparse rewards remains a
fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. While hindsight experience
replay (HER) has shown promise by relabeling collected trajectories with
achieved goals, we argue that trajectory relabeling alone does not fully
exploit the available experiences in off-policy GCRL methods, resulting in
limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we propose Hindsight Goal-conditioned
Regularization (HGR), a technique that generates action regularization priors
based on hindsight goals. When combined with hindsight self-imitation
regularization (HSR), our approach enables off-policy RL algorithms to maximize
experience utilization. Compared to existing GCRL methods that employ HER and
self-imitation techniques, our hindsight regularizations achieve substantially
more efficient sample reuse and the best performances, which we empirically
demonstrate on a suite of navigation and manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Federated clustering aims to group similar clients into clusters and produce
one model for each cluster. Such a personalization approach typically improves
model performance compared with training a single model to serve all clients,
but can be more vulnerable to privacy leakage. Directly applying client-level
differentially private (DP) mechanisms to federated clustering could degrade
the utilities significantly. We identify that such deficiencies are mainly due
to the difficulties of averaging privacy noise within each cluster (following
standard privacy mechanisms), as the number of clients assigned to the same
clusters is uncontrolled. To this end, we propose a simple and effective
technique, named RR-Cluster, that can be viewed as a light-weight add-on to
many federated clustering algorithms. RR-Cluster achieves reduced privacy noise
via randomly rebalancing cluster assignments, guaranteeing a minimum number of
clients assigned to each cluster. We analyze the tradeoffs between decreased
privacy noise variance and potentially increased bias from incorrect
assignments and provide convergence bounds for RR-Clsuter. Empirically, we
demonstrate the RR-Cluster plugged into strong federated clustering algorithms
results in significantly improved privacy/utility tradeoffs across both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Federated recommendation systems (FedRecs) have gained significant attention
for providing privacy-preserving recommendation services. However, existing
FedRecs assume that all users have the same requirements for privacy
protection, i.e., they do not upload any data to the server. The approaches
overlook the potential to enhance the recommendation service by utilizing
publicly available user data. In real-world applications, users can choose to
be private or public. Private users' interaction data is not shared, while
public users' interaction data can be shared. Inspired by the issue, this paper
proposes a novel Graph Federated Learning for Personalized Privacy
Recommendation (GFed-PP) that adapts to different privacy requirements while
improving recommendation performance. GFed-PP incorporates the interaction data
of public users to build a user-item interaction graph, which is then used to
form a user relationship graph. A lightweight graph convolutional network (GCN)
is employed to learn each user's user-specific personalized item embedding. To
protect user privacy, each client learns the user embedding and the scoring
function locally. Additionally, GFed-PP achieves optimization of the federated
recommendation framework through the initialization of item embedding on
clients and the aggregation of the user relationship graph on the server.
Experimental results demonstrate that GFed-PP significantly outperforms
existing methods for five datasets, offering superior recommendation accuracy
without compromising privacy. This framework provides a practical solution for
accommodating varying privacy preferences in federated recommendation systems.

Motivation: 现有的组合多臂老虎机算法（如CUCB和EXP3.M）在长期决策中存在遗憾因子或计算效率问题，CMOSS旨在解决这一权衡。

Method: 提出CMOSS算法，基于半强盗反馈实现高效计算，并扩展到级联反馈场景。

Result: CMOSS实现了与理论下限匹配的遗憾（O((log k)^2√kmT)），且在实验中优于基准算法。

Conclusion: CMOSS是一种高效且理论最优的组合多臂老虎机算法，适用于多种反馈场景。

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) is a cornerstone of sequential
decision-making framework, dominated by two algorithmic families: UCB-based and
adversarial methods such as follow the regularized leader (FTRL) and online
mirror descent (OMD). However, prominent UCB-based approaches like CUCB suffer
from additional regret factor $\log T$ that is detrimental over long horizons,
while adversarial methods such as EXP3.M and HYBRID impose significant
computational overhead. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce the
Combinatorial Minimax Optimal Strategy in the Stochastic setting (CMOSS). CMOSS
is a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves an instance-independent
regret of $O\big( (\log k)^2\sqrt{kmT}\big )$ under semi-bandit feedback, where
$m$ is the number of arms and $k$ is the maximum cardinality of a feasible
action. Crucially, this result eliminates the dependency on $\log T$ and
matches the established $\Omega\big( \sqrt{kmT}\big)$ lower bound up to
$O\big((\log k)^2\big)$. We then extend our analysis to show that CMOSS is also
applicable to cascading feedback. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets validate that CMOSS consistently outperforms benchmark algorithms in
both regret and runtime efficiency.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation is a key technique in modern artificial
intelligence, addressing data scarcity, privacy constraints, and the need for
diverse datasets in training robust models. In this work, we propose a method
for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using
Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the
MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE,
and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities.
To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient
clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via R\'enyi Differential
Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and
downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS
outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints.
This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data
generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations
with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable
and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design
facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and
confidentiality are critical.

Conclusion: CL是印度语言ASR系统在现实约束下的可行方案。

Abstract: Indias linguistic diversity poses significant challenges for developing
inclusive Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Traditional multilingual
models, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical
due to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual
Learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages
sequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge.
This paper investigates CL for ASR on Indian languages using a subset of the
IndicSUPERB benchmark. We employ a Conformer-based hybrid RNN-T/CTC model,
initially pretrained on Hindi, which is then incrementally trained on eight
additional Indian languages, for a total sequence of nine languages. We
evaluate three prominent regularization- and distillation-based CL strategies:
Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Learning
without Forgetting (LwF), selected for their suitability in no-replay,
privacy-conscious scenarios. Performance is analyzed using Word Error Rate
(WER) for both RNN-T and CTC paths on clean and noisy data, as well as
knowledge retention via Backward Transfer. We also explore the impact of
varying the number of training epochs (1, 2, 5, and 10) per task. Results,
compared against naive fine-tuning, demonstrate CLs effectiveness in mitigating
forgetting, making it a promising approach for scalable ASR in diverse Indian
languages under realistic constraints. The code is available at:

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing is an emerging technology enabling low-latency and
energy-efficient signal processing. A key algorithmic tool in neuromorphic
computing is spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs are biologically inspired
neural networks which utilize stateful neurons, and provide low-bit data
processing by encoding and decoding information using spikes. Similar to SNNs,
deep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks. However, deep
SSMs, which recently achieved competitive performance in various temporal
modeling tasks, are typically designed with high-precision activation functions
and no reset mechanisms. To bridge the gains offered by SNNs and the recent
deep SSM models, we propose a novel multiple-output spiking neuron model that
combines a linear, general SSM state transition with a non-linear feedback
mechanism through reset. Compared to the existing neuron models for SNNs, our
proposed model clearly conceptualizes the differences between the spiking
function, the reset condition and the reset action. The experimental results on
various tasks, i.e., a keyword spotting task, an event-based vision task and a
sequential pattern recognition task, show that our proposed model achieves
performance comparable to existing benchmarks in the SNN literature. Our
results illustrate how the proposed reset mechanism can overcome instability
and enable learning even when the linear part of neuron dynamics is unstable,
allowing us to go beyond the strictly enforced stability of linear dynamics in
recent deep SSM models.

Abstract: Neural fields provide a memory-efficient representation of data, which can
effectively handle diverse modalities and large-scale data. However, learning
to map neural fields often requires large amounts of training data and
computations, which can be limited to resource-constrained edge devices. One
approach to tackle this limitation is to leverage Federated Meta-Learning
(FML), but traditional FML approaches suffer from privacy leakage. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel FML approach called FedMeNF. FedMeNF
utilizes a new privacy-preserving loss function that regulates privacy leakage
in the local meta-optimization. This enables the local meta-learner to optimize
quickly and efficiently without retaining the client's private data. Our
experiments demonstrate that FedMeNF achieves fast optimization speed and
robust reconstruction performance, even with few-shot or non-IID data across
diverse data modalities, while preserving client data privacy.

Conclusion: FCL通过动态调整损失函数，有效应对标签噪声，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Robust loss functions are crucial for training deep neural networks in the
presence of label noise, yet existing approaches require extensive,
dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Fractional
Classification Loss (FCL), an adaptive robust loss that automatically
calibrates its robustness to label noise during training. Built within the
active-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the
Cross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) as its passive loss component. With this formulation, we demonstrate that
the fractional derivative order $\mu$ spans a family of loss functions that
interpolate between MAE-like robustness and CE-like fast convergence.
Furthermore, we integrate $\mu$ into the gradient-based optimization as a
learnable parameter and automatically adjust it to optimize the trade-off
between robustness and convergence speed. We reveal that FCL's unique property
establishes a critical trade-off that enables the stable learning of $\mu$:
lower log penalties on difficult or mislabeled examples improve robustness but
impose higher penalties on easy or clean data, reducing model confidence in
them. Consequently, FCL can dynamically reshape its loss landscape to achieve
effective classification performance under label noise. Extensive experiments
on benchmark datasets show that FCL achieves state-of-the-art results without
the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Learning interpretable latent representations from tabular data remains a
challenge in deep generative modeling. We introduce SE-VAE (Structural
Equation-Variational Autoencoder), a novel architecture that embeds measurement
structure directly into the design of a variational autoencoder. Inspired by
structural equation modeling, SE-VAE aligns latent subspaces with known
indicator groupings and introduces a global nuisance latent to isolate
construct-specific confounding variation. This modular architecture enables
disentanglement through design rather than through statistical regularizers
alone. We evaluate SE-VAE on a suite of simulated tabular datasets and
benchmark its performance against a series of leading baselines using standard
disentanglement metrics. SE-VAE consistently outperforms alternatives in factor
recovery, interpretability, and robustness to nuisance variation. Ablation
results reveal that architectural structure, rather than regularization
strength, is the key driver of performance. SE-VAE offers a principled
framework for white-box generative modeling in scientific and social domains
where latent constructs are theory-driven and measurement validity is
essential.

Abstract: This paper introduces Geometric-k-means (or Gk-means for short), a novel
approach that significantly enhances the efficiency and energy economy of the
widely utilized k-means algorithm, which, despite its inception over five
decades ago, remains a cornerstone in machine learning applications. The
essence of Gk-means lies in its active utilization of geometric principles,
specifically scalar projection, to significantly accelerate the algorithm
without sacrificing solution quality. This geometric strategy enables a more
discerning focus on data points that are most likely to influence cluster
updates, which we call as high expressive data (HE). In contrast, low
expressive data (LE), does not impact clustering outcome, is effectively
bypassed, leading to considerable reductions in computational overhead.
Experiments spanning synthetic, real-world and high-dimensional datasets,
demonstrate Gk-means is significantly better than traditional and state of the
art (SOTA) k-means variants in runtime and distance computations (DC).
Moreover, Gk-means exhibits better resource efficiency, as evidenced by its
reduced energy footprint, placing it as more sustainable alternative.

Abstract: Effective query reformulation is pivotal in narrowing the gap between a
user's exploratory search behavior and the identification of relevant products
in e-commerce environments. While traditional approaches predominantly model
query rewrites as isolated pairs, they often fail to capture the sequential and
transitional dynamics inherent in real-world user behavior. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that explicitly models transitional
queries--intermediate reformulations occurring during the user's journey toward
their final purchase intent. By mining structured query trajectories from
eBay's large-scale user interaction logs, we reconstruct query sequences that
reflect shifts in intent while preserving semantic coherence. This approach
allows us to model a user's shopping funnel, where mid-journey transitions
reflect exploratory behavior and intent refinement. Furthermore, we incorporate
generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce semantically diverse and
intent-preserving alternative queries, extending beyond what can be derived
through collaborative filtering alone. These reformulations can be leveraged to
populate Related Searches or to power intent-clustered carousels on the search
results page, enhancing both discovery and engagement. Our contributions
include (i) the formal identification and modeling of transitional queries,
(ii) the introduction of a structured query sequence mining pipeline for intent
flow understanding, and (iii) the application of LLMs for scalable,
intent-aware query expansion. Empirical evaluation demonstrates measurable
gains in conversion and engagement metrics compared to the existing Related
Searches module, validating the effectiveness of our approach in real-world
e-commerce settings.

Abstract: Building Information Modeling (BIM) is essential for managing building data
across the entire lifecycle, supporting tasks from design to maintenance.
Natural Language Interface (NLI) systems are increasingly explored as
user-friendly tools for information retrieval in Building Information Modeling
(BIM) environments. Despite their potential, accurately extracting BIM-related
data through natural language queries remains a persistent challenge due to the
complexity use queries and specificity of domain knowledge. This study presents
a comparative analysis of two prominent approaches for developing NLI-based BIM
information retrieval systems: domain-specific fine-tuning and prompt-based
learning using large language models (LLMs). A two-stage framework consisting
of intent recognition and table-based question answering is implemented to
evaluate the effectiveness of both approaches. To support this evaluation, a
BIM-specific dataset of 1,740 annotated queries of varying types across 69
models is constructed. Experimental results show that domain-specific
fine-tuning delivers superior performance in intent recognition tasks, while
prompt-based learning, particularly with GPT-4o, shows strength in table-based
question answering. Based on these findings, this study identify a hybrid
configuration that combines fine-tuning for intent recognition with
prompt-based learning for question answering, achieving more balanced and
robust performance across tasks. This integrated approach is further tested
through case studies involving BIM models of varying complexity. This study
provides a systematic analysis of the strengths and limitations of each
approach and discusses the applicability of the NLI to real-world BIM
scenarios. The findings offer insights for researchers and practitioners in
designing intelligent, language-driven BIM systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of multi-modal fake news on social media poses a
significant threat to public trust and social stability. Traditional detection
methods, primarily text-based, often fall short due to the deceptive interplay
between misleading text and images. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
offer promising avenues for multi-modal understanding, effectively fusing
diverse modal information, especially when their importance is imbalanced or
contradictory, remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces
MM-FusionNet, an innovative framework leveraging LVLMs for robust multi-modal
fake news detection. Our core contribution is the Context-Aware Dynamic Fusion
Module (CADFM), which employs bi-directional cross-modal attention and a novel
dynamic modal gating network. This mechanism adaptively learns and assigns
importance weights to textual and visual features based on their contextual
relevance, enabling intelligent prioritization of information. Evaluated on the
large-scale Multi-modal Fake News Dataset (LMFND) comprising 80,000 samples,
MM-FusionNet achieves a state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.938, surpassing existing
multi-modal baselines by approximately 0.5% and significantly outperforming

Abstract: Enterprises are facing increasing risks of insider threats, while existing

reasons such as insufficient temporal dynamic feature modeling, computational
efficiency and real-time bottlenecks and cross-modal information island
problem. This paper proposes a new insider threat detection framework MambaITD
based on the Mamba state space model and cross-modal adaptive fusion. First,
the multi-source log preprocessing module aligns heterogeneous data through
behavioral sequence encoding, interval smoothing, and statistical feature
extraction. Second, the Mamba encoder models long-range dependencies in
behavioral and interval sequences, and combines the sequence and statistical
information dynamically in combination with the gated feature fusion mechanism.
Finally, we propose an adaptive threshold optimization method based on
maximizing inter-class variance, which dynamically adjusts the decision
threshold by analyzing the probability distribution, effectively identifies
anomalies, and alleviates class imbalance and concept drift. Compared with
traditional methods, MambaITD shows significant advantages in modeling
efficiency and feature fusion capabilities, outperforming Transformer-based
methods, and provides a more effective solution for insider threat detection.

Method: 结合LLM的用户群体聚类和群体感知的强化学习方法。

Result: 在IF-VR基准上，G-UBS显著优于主流LLM和MLLM模型。

Conclusion: G-UBS能有效提升推荐系统的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: User feedback is critical for refining recommendation systems, yet explicit
feedback (e.g., likes or dislikes) remains scarce in practice. As a more
feasible alternative, inferring user preferences from massive implicit feedback
has shown great potential (e.g., a user quickly skipping a recommended video
usually indicates disinterest). Unfortunately, implicit feedback is often
noisy: a user might skip a video due to accidental clicks or other reasons,
rather than disliking it. Such noise can easily misjudge user interests,
thereby undermining recommendation performance. To address this issue, we
propose a novel Group-aware User Behavior Simulation (G-UBS) paradigm, which
leverages contextual guidance from relevant user groups, enabling robust and
in-depth interpretation of implicit feedback for individual users.
Specifically, G-UBS operates via two key agents. First, the User Group Manager
(UGM) effectively clusters users to generate group profiles utilizing a
``summarize-cluster-reflect" workflow based on LLMs. Second, the User Feedback
Modeler (UFM) employs an innovative group-aware reinforcement learning
approach, where each user is guided by the associated group profiles during the
reinforcement learning process, allowing UFM to robustly and deeply examine the
reasons behind implicit feedback. To assess our G-UBS paradigm, we have
constructed a Video Recommendation benchmark with Implicit Feedback (IF-VR). To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal benchmark for implicit
feedback evaluation in video recommendation, encompassing 15k users, 25k
videos, and 933k interaction records with implicit feedback. Extensive
experiments on IF-VR demonstrate that G-UBS significantly outperforms
mainstream LLMs and MLLMs, with a 4.0% higher proportion of videos achieving a
play rate > 30% and 14.9% higher reasoning accuracy on IF-VR.

Abstract: Universal machine learning force fields (UMLFFs) promise to revolutionize
materials science by enabling rapid atomistic simulations across the periodic
table. However, their evaluation has been limited to computational benchmarks
that may not reflect real-world performance. Here, we present UniFFBench, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating UMLFFs against experimental measurements
of ~1,500 carefully curated mineral structures spanning diverse chemical
environments, bonding types, structural complexity, and elastic properties. Our
systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art UMLFFs reveals a substantial
reality gap: models achieving impressive performance on computational
benchmarks often fail when confronted with experimental complexity. Even the
best-performing models exhibit higher density prediction error than the
threshold required for practical applications. Most strikingly, we observe
disconnects between simulation stability and mechanical property accuracy, with
prediction errors correlating with training data representation rather than the
modeling method. These findings demonstrate that while current computational
benchmarks provide valuable controlled comparisons, they may overestimate model
reliability when extrapolated to experimentally complex chemical spaces.
Altogether, UniFFBench establishes essential experimental validation standards
and reveals systematic limitations that must be addressed to achieve truly
universal force field capabilities.

Abstract: Motivated by applications in crowdsourcing, where a fixed sum of money is
split among $K$ workers, and autobidding, where a fixed budget is used to bid
in $K$ simultaneous auctions, we define a stochastic bandit model where arms
belong to the $K$-dimensional probability simplex and represent the fraction of
budget allocated to each task/auction. The reward in each round is the sum of
$K$ stochastic rewards, where each of these rewards is unlocked with a
probability that varies with the fraction of the budget allocated to that
task/auction. We design an algorithm whose expected regret after $T$ steps is
of order $K\sqrt{T}$ (up to log factors) and prove a matching lower bound.
Improved bounds of order $K (\log T)^2$ are shown when the function mapping
budget to probability of unlocking the reward (i.e., terminating the task or
winning the auction) satisfies additional diminishing-returns conditions.

Abstract: One of the challenging problems in Music Information Retrieval is the
acquisition of enough non-copyrighted audio recordings for model training and
evaluation. This study compares two Transformer-based neural network models for
chord sequence recognition in audio recordings and examines the effectiveness
of using an artificially generated dataset for this purpose. The models are
trained on various combinations of Artificial Audio Multitracks (AAM),
Schubert's Winterreise Dataset, and the McGill Billboard Dataset and evaluated
with three metrics: Root, MajMin and Chord Content Metric (CCM). The
experiments prove that even though there are certainly differences in
complexity and structure between artificially generated and human-composed
music, the former can be useful in certain scenarios. Specifically, AAM can
enrich a smaller training dataset of music composed by a human or can even be
used as a standalone training set for a model that predicts chord sequences in
pop music, if no other data is available.

Conclusion: BiCB在直播广告中实现了高效实时竞价，解决了未来流量未知的难题。

Abstract: Internet live streaming is widely used in online entertainment and
e-commerce, where live advertising is an important marketing tool for anchors.
An advertising campaign hopes to maximize the effect (such as conversions)
under constraints (such as budget and cost-per-click). The mainstream control
of campaigns is auto-bidding, where the performance depends on the decision of
the bidding algorithm in each request. The most widely used auto-bidding
algorithms include Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, linear
programming (LP), reinforcement learning (RL), etc. Existing methods either do
not consider the entire time traffic, or have too high computational
complexity. In this paper, the live advertising has high requirements for
real-time bidding (second-level control) and faces the difficulty of unknown
future traffic. Therefore, we propose a lightweight bidding algorithm Binary
Constrained Bidding (BiCB), which neatly combines the optimal bidding formula
given by mathematical analysis and the statistical method of future traffic
estimation, and obtains good approximation to the optimal result through a low
complexity solution. In addition, we complement the form of upper and lower
bound constraints for traditional auto-bidding modeling and give theoretical
analysis of BiCB. Sufficient offline and online experiments prove BiCB's good
performance and low engineering cost.

Result: 在八个基准数据集上表现优异，尤其在生物医学数据集上提升7.34%，同时提高了聚类稳定性和效率。

Conclusion: IOCC通过优化表示分布，显著提升了聚类性能。

Abstract: In clustering tasks, it is essential to structure the feature space into
clear, well-separated distributions. However, because short text
representations have limited expressiveness, conventional methods struggle to
identify cluster centers that truly capture each category's underlying
semantics, causing the representations to be optimized in suboptimal
directions. To address this issue, we propose IOCC, a novel few-shot
contrastive learning method that achieves alignment between the cluster centers
and the semantic centers. IOCC consists of two key modules:
Interaction-enhanced Optimal Transport (IEOT) and Center-aware Contrastive
Learning (CACL). Specifically, IEOT incorporates semantic interactions between
individual samples into the conventional optimal transport problem, and
generate pseudo-labels. Based on these pseudo-labels, we aggregate
high-confidence samples to construct pseudo-centers that approximate the
semantic centers. Next, CACL optimizes text representations toward their
corresponding pseudo-centers. As training progresses, the collaboration between
the two modules gradually reduces the gap between cluster centers and semantic
centers. Therefore, the model will learn a high-quality distribution, improving
clustering performance. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets show
that IOCC outperforms previous methods, achieving up to 7.34\% improvement on
challenging Biomedical dataset and also excelling in clustering stability and
efficiency. The code is available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征相关性会干扰特征重要性评分的准确性，导致噪声特征可能获得比信号特征更高的评分。本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出losaw方法，结合逆概率加权思想，在模型内部局部加权样本以减少特征相关性。适用于决策树和神经网络。

Result: 模拟研究表明，losaw能一致提升FI评分，并在保持分布内数据准确性的同时，提升分布外数据的预测准确性。

Conclusion: losaw是一种灵活且有效的方法，可改进特征相关性场景下的FI评分和模型性能。

Abstract: Feature importance (FI) statistics provide a prominent and valuable method of
insight into the decision process of machine learning (ML) models, but their
effectiveness has well-known limitations when correlation is present among the
features in the training data. In this case, the FI often tends to be
distributed among all features which are in correlation with the
response-generating signal features. Even worse, if multiple signal features
are in strong correlation with a noise feature, while being only modestly
correlated with one another, this can result in a noise feature having a
distinctly larger FI score than any signal feature. Here we propose local
sample weighting (losaw) which can flexibly be integrated into many ML
algorithms to improve FI scores in the presence of feature correlation in the
training data. Our approach is motivated from inverse probability weighting in
causal inference and locally, within the ML model, uses a sample weighting
scheme to decorrelate a target feature from the remaining features. This
reduces model bias locally, whenever the effect of a potential signal feature
is evaluated and compared to others. Moreover, losaw comes with a natural
tuning parameter, the minimum effective sample size of the weighted population,
which corresponds to an interpretation-prediction-tradeoff, analog to a
bias-variance-tradeoff as for classical ML tuning parameters. We demonstrate
how losaw can be integrated within decision tree-based ML methods and within
mini-batch training of neural networks. We investigate losaw for random forest
and convolutional neural networks in a simulation study on settings showing
diverse correlation patterns. We found that losaw improves FI consistently.
Moreover, it often improves prediction accuracy for out-of-distribution, while
maintaining a similar accuracy for in-distribution test data.

Result: 理论证明DP-SPRT在误差较小且假设接近时接近最优，实验验证了其良好的实际性能。

Conclusion: DP-SPRT是一种高效且隐私保护的序列测试方法，适用于多种隐私需求场景。

Abstract: We revisit Wald's celebrated Sequential Probability Ratio Test for sequential
tests of two simple hypotheses, under privacy constraints. We propose DP-SPRT,
a wrapper that can be calibrated to achieve desired error probabilities and
privacy constraints, addressing a significant gap in previous work. DP-SPRT
relies on a private mechanism that processes a sequence of queries and stops
after privately determining when the query results fall outside a predefined
interval. This OutsideInterval mechanism improves upon naive composition of
existing techniques like AboveThreshold, potentially benefiting other
sequential algorithms. We prove generic upper bounds on the error and sample
complexity of DP-SPRT that can accommodate various noise distributions based on
the practitioner's privacy needs. We exemplify them in two settings: Laplace
noise (pure Differential Privacy) and Gaussian noise (R\'enyi differential
privacy). In the former setting, by providing a lower bound on the sample
complexity of any $\epsilon$-DP test with prescribed type I and type II errors,
we show that DP-SPRT is near optimal when both errors are small and the two
hypotheses are close. Moreover, we conduct an experimental study revealing its
good practical performance.

Abstract: Symbolic indefinite integration in Computer Algebra Systems such as Maple
involves selecting the most effective algorithm from multiple available
methods. Not all methods will succeed for a given problem, and when several do,
the results, though mathematically equivalent, can differ greatly in
presentation complexity. Traditionally, this choice has been made with minimal
consideration of the problem instance, leading to inefficiencies.
  We present a machine learning (ML) approach using tree-based deep learning
models within a two-stage architecture: first identifying applicable methods
for a given instance, then ranking them by predicted output complexity.
Furthermore, we find representing mathematical expressions as tree structures
significantly improves performance over sequence-based representations, and our
two-stage framework outperforms alternative ML formulations.
  Using a diverse dataset generated by six distinct data generators, our models
achieve nearly 90% accuracy in selecting the optimal method on a 70,000 example
holdout test set. On an independent out-of-distribution benchmark from Maple's
internal test suite, our tree transformer model maintains strong
generalisation, outperforming Maple's built-in selector and prior ML
approaches.
  These results highlight the critical role of data representation and problem
framing in ML for symbolic computation, and we expect our methodology to
generalise effectively to similar optimisation problems in mathematical
software.

design patterns from blockchain-verified centralized coordination to fully
decentralized peer-to-peer networks, evaluating trade-offs in scalability,
security, and performance. Through detailed examination of consensus mechanisms
designed for federated learning contexts, including Proof of Quality and Proof

from arbitrary cryptographic puzzles to productive machine learning tasks. The
chapter addresses critical storage challenges by examining multi-tier
architectures that balance blockchain's transaction constraints with neural
networks' large parameter requirements while maintaining cryptographic
integrity. A technical case study of the TrustMesh framework illustrates
practical implementation considerations in BCFL systems through distributed
image classification training, demonstrating effective collaborative learning
across IoT devices with highly non-IID data distributions while maintaining
complete transparency and fault tolerance. Analysis of real-world deployments
across healthcare consortiums, financial services, and IoT security
applications validates the practical viability of BCFL systems, achieving
performance comparable to centralized approaches while providing enhanced

Abstract: Cold-start challenges in recommender systems necessitate leveraging auxiliary
features beyond user-item interactions. However, the presence of irrelevant or
noisy features can degrade predictive performance, whereas an excessive number
of features increases computational demands, leading to higher memory
consumption and prolonged training times.
  To address this, we propose a feature selection strategy that prioritizes the
user behavioral information. Our method enhances the feature representation by
incorporating correlations from collaborative behavior data using a hybrid
matrix factorization technique and then ranks features using a mechanism based
on the maximum volume algorithm. This approach identifies the most influential
features, striking a balance between recommendation accuracy and computational
efficiency. We conduct an extensive evaluation across various datasets and
hybrid recommendation models, demonstrating that our method excels in
cold-start scenarios by selecting minimal yet highly effective feature subsets.
Even under strict feature reduction, our approach surpasses existing feature
selection techniques while maintaining superior efficiency.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel framework for representing and analyzing
physical laws as a weighted knowledge graph. We constructed a database of 659
distinct physical equations, subjected to rigorous semantic cleaning to resolve
notational ambiguities, resulting in a corpus of 400 advanced physics
equations. We developed an enhanced graph representation where both physical
concepts and equations are nodes, connected by weighted inter-equation bridges.
These weights are objectively defined using normalized metrics for variable
overlap, physics-informed importance scores, and bibliometric data. A Graph
Attention Network (GAT) was trained for link prediction, achieving a test AUC
of 0.9742 +/- 0.0018 across five independent runs, significantly outperforming
both classical heuristics (best baseline AUC: 0.9487) and established GNN
architectures like GraphSAGE (AUC: 0.9504, p = 0.029). Statistical testing
confirmed significance of all comparisons (p < 0.05), with 2.7% improvement
over the best baseline. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (i) The model
autonomously rediscovers the known macroscopic structure of physics,
identifying strong conceptual axes between Electromagnetism and Statistical
Mechanics. (ii) It identifies central hub equations that serve as critical
bridges between multiple physical domains. (iii) The model generates stable,
computationally-derived hypotheses for cross-domain relationships, identifying
both known principles and suggesting novel mathematical analogies for further
theoretical investigation. The framework can generate hundreds of such
hypotheses, enabling the creation of specialized datasets for targeted analysis
of specific physics subfields. Code and data available at

Conclusion: 神经网络nudging方法为非线性状态空间模型提供了一种有效的控制项设计解决方案。

Abstract: Nudging is an empirical data assimilation technique that incorporates an
observation-driven control term into the model dynamics. The trajectory of the
nudged system approaches the true system trajectory over time, even when the
initial conditions differ. For linear state space models, such control terms
can be derived under mild assumptions. However, designing effective nudging
terms becomes significantly more challenging in the nonlinear setting. In this
work, we propose neural network nudging, a data-driven method for learning
nudging terms in nonlinear state space models. We establish a theoretical
existence result based on the Kazantzis--Kravaris--Luenberger observer theory.
The proposed approach is evaluated on three benchmark problems that exhibit
chaotic behavior: the Lorenz 96 model, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and
the Kolmogorov flow.

Abstract: The research paper addresses decomposition of a stochastic time series into
three time series representing a dual signal i.e., the mean and the dispersion,
with noise isolated. Decomposition is done by applying machine learning to fit
a dual signal. Machine learning minimizes the loss function which compromises
between fitting the original time series and penalizing irregularities of the
dual signal. The latter includes terms based on the first and second order
derivatives along time. To preserve special patterns, weighting of the
regularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on
Statistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be
applied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time
series. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition can be seen as a
denoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process have been
considered: sequential and jointly. The former approach learns the mean signal
first and then dispersion. The latter approach fits the dual signal jointly.
Jointly learning can uncover complex relationships for the time series with
heteroskedasticity. Learning has been set by solving the direct non-linear
unconstrained optimization problem or by applying neural networks that have
sequential or twin output architectures. Tuning of the loss function
hyperparameters focuses on the isolated noise to be a stationary stochastic
process without autocorrelation properties. Depending on the applications, the
hyperparameters of the learning can be tuned towards either the discrete states
by stepped signal or smoothed series. The decomposed dual signal can be
represented on the 2D space and used to learn inherent structures, to forecast
both mean and dispersion, or to analyze cross effects in case of multiple time
series.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are common in real-world scenarios and often
exhibit heterophily. However, most existing studies focus on either
heterogeneity or heterophily in isolation, overlooking the prevalence of
heterophilic HGs in practical applications. Such ignorance leads to their
performance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in
modeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and
meta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of
semantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive
Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN
employs a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily
distributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages
from diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which
filters out noise and emphasizes informative signals. Experiments on seven
real-world graphs and twenty baselines demonstrate the superior performance of
AHGNN, particularly in high-heterophily situations.

actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic
algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a
diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and
non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion
locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic

interventions can have positive or unintended negative consequences. Current
research to model and determine an optimal intervention automatically through
round-tripping is limited by the simulation objectives, scale (a few thousand
individuals), model types that are not suited for intervention studies, and the
number of intervention strategies they can explore (discrete vs continuous). We
address these challenges using a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
based policy optimization framework on a large-scale (100,000 individual)
epidemiological agent-based simulation where we perform multi-objective
optimization. We determine the optimal policy for lockdown and vaccination in a
minimalist age-stratified multi-vaccine scenario with a basic simulation for
economic activity. With no lockdown and vaccination (mid-age and elderly),
results show optimal economy (individuals below the poverty line) with balanced
health objectives (infection, and hospitalization). An in-depth simulation is
needed to further validate our results and open-source our framework.

Abstract: Integrating multi-omics datasets through data-driven analysis offers a
comprehensive understanding of the complex biological processes underlying
various diseases, particularly cancer. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have
recently demonstrated remarkable ability to exploit relational structures in
biological data, enabling advances in multi-omics integration for cancer
subtype classification. Existing approaches often neglect the intricate
coupling between heterogeneous omics, limiting their capacity to resolve subtle
cancer subtype heterogeneity critical for precision oncology. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework named Graph Transformer for Multi-omics
Cancer Subtype Classification (GTMancer). This framework builds upon the GNN
optimization problem and extends its application to complex multi-omics data.
Specifically, our method leverages contrastive learning to embed multi-omics
data into a unified semantic space. We unroll the multiplex graph optimization
problem in that unified space and introduce dual sets of attention coefficients
to capture structural graph priors both within and among multi-omics data. This
approach enables global omics information to guide the refining of the
representations of individual omics. Empirical experiments on seven real-world
cancer datasets demonstrate that GTMancer outperforms existing state-of-the-art
algorithms.

Abstract: Achieving precise control over a molecule's biological activity-encompassing
targeted activation/inhibition, cooperative multi-target modulation, and
off-target toxicity mitigation-remains a critical challenge in de novo drug
design. However, existing generative methods primarily focus on producing
molecules with a single desired activity, lacking integrated mechanisms for the
simultaneous management of multiple intended and unintended molecular
interactions. Here, we propose ActivityDiff, a generative approach based on the
classifier-guidance technique of diffusion models. It leverages separately
trained drug-target classifiers for both positive and negative guidance,
enabling the model to enhance desired activities while minimizing harmful
off-target effects. Experimental results show that ActivityDiff effectively
handles essential drug design tasks, including single-/dual-target generation,
fragment-constrained dual-target design, selective generation to enhance target
specificity, and reduction of off-target effects. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion in balancing efficacy and safety
in molecular design. Overall, our work introduces a novel paradigm for
achieving integrated control over molecular activity, and provides ActivityDiff
as a versatile and extensible framework.

Conclusion: AC算法能有效防御Pac-Man攻击，保障去中心化学习的稳定性。

Abstract: Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed
systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications
in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes
them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate
an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious
node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior
gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the
learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we
propose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanism
for duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our
theoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almost
surely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remains
convergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiable
deviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on both
synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings.
Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as a
function of the duplication threshold. We offer theoretical insights by
analyzing a simplified variant of the AC, which sheds light on the observed
phase transition.

Conclusion: 结合无监督和有监督学习的方法显著提升了数据库异常检测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Database systems are extensively used to store critical data across various
domains. However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as
database intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise.
Internal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it
easier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external
masqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the
organization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect
anomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences
of operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent
normal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble
normal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to
identify. This paper introduces a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for
Structured Query Language (SQL) using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers (BERT) model, specifically DistilBERT, a more efficient,
pre-trained version. Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised
machine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while
minimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses
ensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned
normal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope
queries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based
models to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using
role-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data. Our findings
make a significant contribution by providing an effective solution for
safeguarding critical database systems from sophisticated threats.

Abstract: Current and upcoming cosmological surveys will produce unprecedented amounts
of high-dimensional data, which require complex high-fidelity forward
simulations to accurately model both physical processes and systematic effects
which describe the data generation process. However, validating whether our
theoretical models accurately describe the observed datasets remains a
fundamental challenge. An additional complexity to this task comes from
choosing appropriate representations of the data which retain all the relevant
cosmological information, while reducing the dimensionality of the original
dataset. In this work we present a novel framework combining scale-dependent
neural summary statistics with normalizing flows to detect model
misspecification in cosmological simulations through Bayesian evidence
estimation. By conditioning our neural network models for data compression and
evidence estimation on the smoothing scale, we systematically identify where
theoretical models break down in a data-driven manner. We demonstrate a first
application to our approach using matter and gas density fields from three
CAMELS simulation suites with different subgrid physics implementations.

Abstract: We consider matrices $\boldsymbol{A}(\boldsymbol\theta)\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times

a compact parameter space $\Theta$. We present a Monte Carlo estimator for
minimizing $\text{trace}(\boldsymbol{A}(\boldsymbol\theta))$ over all
$\boldsymbol\theta\in\Theta$, and determine the sampling amount so that the
backward error of the estimator is bounded with high probability. We derive two
types of bounds, based on epsilon nets and on generic chaining. Both types
predict a small sampling amount for matrices
$\boldsymbol{A}(\boldsymbol\theta)$ with small offdiagonal mass, and parameter
spaces $\Theta$ of small ``size.'' Dependence on the matrix dimension~$m$ is
only weak or not explicit. The bounds based on epsilon nets are easier to
evaluate and come with fully specified constants. In contrast, the bounds based
on chaining depend on the Talagrand functionals which are difficult to
evaluate, except in very special cases. Comparisons between the two types of
bounds are difficult, although the literature suggests that chaining bounds can
be superior.

Abstract: High-fidelity electron microscopy simulations required for quantitative
crystal structure refinements face a fundamental challenge: while physical
interactions are well-described theoretically, real-world experimental effects
are challenging to model analytically. To address this gap, we present a novel
hybrid physics-machine learning framework that integrates differentiable
physical simulations with neural networks. By leveraging automatic
differentiation throughout the simulation pipeline, our method enables
gradient-based joint optimization of physical parameters and neural network
components representing experimental variables, offering superior scalability
compared to traditional second-order methods. We demonstrate this framework
through application to three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D-ED) structure
refinement, where our approach learns complex thickness distributions directly
from diffraction data rather than relying on simplified geometric models. This
method achieves state-of-the-art refinement performance across synthetic and
experimental datasets, recovering atomic positions, thermal displacements, and
thickness profiles with high fidelity. The modular architecture proposed can
naturally be extended to accommodate additional physical phenomena and extended
to other electron microscopy techniques. This establishes differentiable hybrid
modeling as a powerful new paradigm for quantitative electron microscopy, where
experimental complexities have historically limited analysis.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) presents potential for early industrial
adoption, yet limited access to quantum hardware remains a significant
bottleneck for deployment of QML solutions. This work explores the use of
classical surrogates to bypass this restriction, which is a technique that
allows to build a lightweight classical representation of a (trained) quantum
model, enabling to perform inference on entirely classical devices. We reveal
prohibiting high computational demand associated with previously proposed
methods for generating classical surrogates from quantum models, and propose an
alternative pipeline enabling generation of classical surrogates at a larger
scale than was previously possible. Previous methods required at least a
high-performance computing (HPC) system for quantum models of below industrial
scale (ca. 20 qubits), which raises questions about its practicality. We
greatly minimize the redundancies of the previous approach, utilizing only a
minute fraction of the resources previously needed. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a real-world energy demand forecasting problem,
conducting rigorous testing of performance and computation demand in both
simulations and on quantum hardware. Our results indicate that our method
achieves high accuracy on the testing dataset while its computational resource
requirements scale linearly rather than exponentially. This work presents a
lightweight approach to transform quantum solutions into classically deployable
versions, facilitating faster integration of quantum technology in industrial
settings. Furthermore, it can serve as a powerful research tool in search
practical quantum advantage in an empirical setup.

Abstract: Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) are widely used in health and environmental
research to represent hypothesized causal structures underlying complex
problems. However, as qualitative and static representations, CLDs are limited
in their ability to support dynamic analysis and inform intervention
strategies. Additionally, quantitative CLD analysis methods like network
centrality analysis often lead to false inference. We propose
Diagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D), a method for converting CLDs into exploratory
system dynamics models (SDMs) in the absence of empirical data. With minimal
user input - following a protocol to label variables as stocks,
flows/auxiliaries, or constants - D2D leverages the structural information
already encoded in CLDs, namely, link existence and polarity, to simulate
hypothetical interventions and explore potential leverage points under
uncertainty. Results suggest that D2D helps distinguish between high- and
low-ranked leverage points. We compare D2D to a data-driven SDM constructed
from the same CLD and variable labeling. D2D showed greater consistency with
the data-driven model than network centrality analysis, while providing
uncertainty estimates and guidance for future data collection. The method is
implemented in an open-source Python package and a web-based application to
support further testing and lower the barrier to dynamic modeling for
researchers working with CLDs. We expect additional validation will further
establish the approach's utility across a broad range of cases and domains.

Abstract: Accurate distribution grid topology is essential for reliable modern grid
operations. However, real-world utility data originates from multiple sources
with varying characteristics and levels of quality. In this work, developed in
collaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework
that reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating
heterogeneous data. We observe that distribution topology is fundamentally
governed by two complementary dimensions: the spatial layout of physical
infrastructure (e.g., GIS and asset metadata) and the dynamic behavior of the
system in the signal domain (e.g., voltage time series). When jointly
leveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent
reconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data
quality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware
inference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect
inputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for
operator interpretation. This soft handling of uncertainty is tightly coupled
with hard enforcement of physical feasibility: we embed operational
constraints, such as transformer capacity limits and radial topology
requirements, directly into the learning process. Together, these components
ensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid,
enabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under
real-world deployment conditions. The proposed framework is validated using
data from over 8000 meters across 3 feeders in Oncor's service territory,
demonstrating over 95% accuracy in topology reconstruction and substantial
improvements in confidence calibration and computational efficiency relative to
baseline methods.

Abstract: Prognostication for comatose post-cardiac arrest patients is a critical
challenge that directly impacts clinical decision-making in the ICU. Clinical
information that informs prognostication is collected serially over time.
Shortly after cardiac arrest, various time-invariant baseline features are
collected (e.g., demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics). After ICU
admission, additional features are gathered, including time-varying hemodynamic
data (e.g., blood pressure, doses of vasopressor medications). We view these as
two phases in which we collect new features. In this study, we propose a novel
stepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of
neurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of
time-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase).
Notably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying
hemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this
information is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient
over time, how important these data are for prognostication varies). Our
approach extends the standard Fine and Gray model to explicitly model the two
phases and to incorporate neural networks to flexibly capture complex nonlinear
feature relationships. Evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 2,278 comatose
post-arrest patients, our model demonstrates robust discriminative performance
for the competing outcomes of awakening, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy,
and death despite maximal support. Our approach generalizes to more than two
phases in which new features are collected and could be used in other dynamic
prediction tasks, where it may be helpful to know when and for whom newly
collected features significantly improve prediction.

Abstract: The advent of 6G networks opens new possibilities for connected infotainment
services in vehicular environments. However, traditional Radio Resource
Management (RRM) techniques struggle with the increasing volume and complexity
of data such as Channel Quality Indicators (CQI) from autonomous vehicles. To
address this, we propose SCAR (State-Space Compression for AI-Driven Resource
Management), an Edge AI-assisted framework that optimizes scheduling and
fairness in vehicular infotainment. SCAR employs ML-based compression
techniques (e.g., clustering and RBF networks) to reduce CQI data size while
preserving essential features. These compressed states are used to train
6G-enabled Reinforcement Learning policies that maximize throughput while
meeting fairness objectives defined by the NGMN. Simulations show that SCAR
increases time in feasible scheduling regions by 14\% and reduces unfair
scheduling time by 15\% compared to RL baselines without CQI compression.
Furthermore, Simulated Annealing with Stochastic Tunneling (SAST)-based
clustering reduces CQI clustering distortion by 10\%, confirming its
efficiency. These results demonstrate SCAR's scalability and fairness benefits
for dynamic vehicular networks.

Abstract: In this work, we discuss what we refer to as reduction techniques for
survival analysis, that is, techniques that "reduce" a survival task to a more
common regression or classification task, without ignoring the specifics of
survival data. Such techniques particularly facilitate machine learning-based
survival analysis, as they allow for applying standard tools from machine and
deep learning to many survival tasks without requiring custom learners. We
provide an overview of different reduction techniques and discuss their
respective strengths and weaknesses. We also provide a principled
implementation of some of these reductions, such that they are directly
available within standard machine learning workflows. We illustrate each
reduction using dedicated examples and perform a benchmark analysis that
compares their predictive performance to established machine learning methods
for survival analysis.

Abstract: Understanding and classifying human cognitive brain states based on
neuroimaging data remains one of the foremost and most challenging problems in
neuroscience, owing to the high dimensionality and intrinsic noise of the
signals. In this work, we propose an ensemble-based graph representation method
of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for the task of binary
brain-state classification. Our method builds the graph by leveraging multiple
base machine-learning models: each edge weight reflects the difference in
posterior probabilities between two cognitive states, yielding values in the
range [-1, 1] that encode confidence in a given state. We applied this approach
to seven cognitive tasks from the Human Connectome Project (HCP 1200 Subject
Release), including working memory, gambling, motor activity, language, social
cognition, relational processing, and emotion processing. Using only the mean
incident edge weights of the graphs as features, a simple logistic-regression
classifier achieved average accuracies from 97.07% to 99.74%. We also compared
our ensemble graphs with classical correlation-based graphs in a classification
task with a graph neural network (GNN). In all experiments, the highest
classification accuracy was obtained with ensemble graphs. These results
demonstrate that ensemble graphs convey richer topological information and
enhance brain-state discrimination. Our approach preserves edge-level
interpretability of the fMRI graph representation, is adaptable to multiclass
and regression tasks, and can be extended to other neuroimaging modalities and
pathological-state classification.

Abstract: Homelessness in the United States has surged to levels unseen since the Great
Depression. However, existing methods for monitoring it, such as point-in-time
(PIT) counts, have limitations in terms of frequency, consistency, and spatial
detail. This study proposes a new approach using publicly available,
crowdsourced data, specifically 311 Service Calls and street-level imagery, to
track and forecast homeless tent trends in San Francisco. Our predictive model
captures fine-grained daily and neighborhood-level variations, uncovering
patterns that traditional counts often overlook, such as rapid fluctuations
during the COVID-19 pandemic and spatial shifts in tent locations over time. By
providing more timely, localized, and cost-effective information, this approach
serves as a valuable tool for guiding policy responses and evaluating
interventions aimed at reducing unsheltered homelessness.
