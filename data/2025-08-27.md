TL;DR: KAIROS基准测试研究LLM在多智能体系统中的信任形成、抗错误信息能力和同伴整合表现，发现GRPO强化学习方法在提升性能的同时降低了模型对社会影响的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在多智能体系统中如何通过历史印象形成信任、抵抗错误信息并整合同伴输入，这些因素对复杂社会动态下实现集体智能至关重要。

Method: 构建KAIROS基准测试模拟问答竞赛，控制专家-新手角色、噪声人群和对抗性同伴等条件，评估提示工程、监督微调和强化学习（GRPO）等缓解策略。

Result: GRPO结合多智能体上下文、基于结果的奖励和无约束推理获得最佳性能，但相比基础模型降低了对社会影响的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多智能体强化学习能有效提升LLM在协作环境中的性能，但需要平衡性能提升与社会影响鲁棒性之间的关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems
(MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions
dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused
on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from
previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during
interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex
social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with
peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over
conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers.
LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing
systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence
influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with
multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained
reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the
robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets
are available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/KAIROS.

TL;DR: 提出了backprompting方法，通过生成类似真实LLM输出的标注数据来改进健康建议护栏检测器，在参数量少400倍的情况下性能超越GPT-4o


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中LLM使用带来风险，护栏技术需要过滤输入输出文本，但获取生产质量的标注数据困难，特别是在部署前难以获得真实LLM输出的标注数据

Method: backprompting方法生成生产级标注数据，结合稀疏人工循环聚类技术进行标注，构建与原始数据集平行但更接近真实LLM输出的语料库，将合成样本注入现有数据集

Result: 在健康建议识别这一最困难的任务中，检测器性能优于其他解决方案，比GPT-4o性能提升3.73%，参数量少400倍

Conclusion: backprompting方法能有效生成生产级标注数据，改进护栏检测器性能，在资源效率方面表现优异

Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has
also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage.
Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs'
input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and
maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the
difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs
prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet
intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice
guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a
sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our
aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original
dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with
our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We
test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the
identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement
versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to
3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.

TL;DR: 提出了Integral Transformer，一种新的自注意力机制，通过对logit分布采样来整合信号，有效去噪注意力同时保留特殊令牌的关键信息，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax自注意力经常给语义无关的特殊令牌和标点符号分配过多权重（注意力噪声），现有方法虽然引入负注意力分数但可能丢失有用信息。

Method: 提出Integral Transformer，通过从logit分布中采样信号来整合信息，实现注意力去噪，同时保留对模型性能至关重要的特殊令牌贡献。

Result: 在知识推理基准测试中优于vanilla、Cog和Differential注意力变体，分析显示在底层使用vanilla自注意力可提升性能，Integral Transformer能有效平衡注意力分布并减少上层秩崩溃。

Conclusion: Integral Transformer提供了一种有效的注意力去噪方法，在保持模型性能的同时解决了注意力噪声问题，为Transformer架构优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically
uninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known
as attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the
Differential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention
scores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the
Integral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention
by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach
mitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical
for model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on
well-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our
analysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer
layers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively
balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

### [4] [Latent Self-Consistency for Reliable Majority-Set Selection in Short- and Long-Answer Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18395)

TL;DR: Latent Self-Consistency (LSC) 是一种新的解码方法，使用可学习的token嵌入选择语义最一致的回答，在短形式和长形式推理基准测试中均优于现有方法，计算开销可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在复杂或长形式问题上概率解码产生不一致输出的问题，现有方法如Self-Consistency在短形式QA有效但无法处理长形式回答，而USC和WUCS扩展至长形式但在短形式基准上准确性下降。

Method: 提出Latent Self-Consistency (LSC)，使用可学习的token嵌入选择语义最一致的回答。通过轻量级的前向生成摘要token，推理时间增加不到1%，无需修改模型架构。

Result: 在6个短形式和5个长形式推理基准测试（如MATH、MMLU、TruthfulQA）中，LSC在所有短形式和长形式基准上平均优于SC、USC和WUCS，同时保持可忽略的计算开销。LSC还提供良好校准的置信度估计，在两种回答格式上都保持低期望校准误差。

Conclusion: LSC是一种实用的跨回答格式一致性选择方法，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升输出一致性和校准性能。

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions.
Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over
exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram
Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on
short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most
semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A
lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by
less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU,
TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form
ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These
results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works
reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated
confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both
answer formats.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了OOD评估的假设，发现在QA任务中不同OOD数据集对模型鲁棒性的评估质量差异很大，有些甚至不如简单的in-distribution评估。作者提出了更稳健的泛化评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究主要通过OOD数据集评估模型泛化能力，但这种方法基于一个强假设：OOD评估能够捕捉真实部署中的可能失败。本文质疑这一假设，并检验OOD评估结果与QA模型中已知的失败模式（如对虚假特征的依赖）之间的关系。

Method: 通过将OOD评估结果与现有QA模型中记录的具体失败模式（依赖虚假特征或预测捷径）进行对比分析，研究不同OOD数据集在评估模型对捷径鲁棒性方面的质量差异。

Result: 发现不同OOD数据集提供的模型鲁棒性估计质量差异很大，有些数据集的表现甚至不如简单的in-distribution评估。部分原因是虚假捷径在ID和OOD数据集之间共享，但也发现数据集在训练和评估质量之间存在脱节的情况。

Conclusion: 常用的基于OOD的泛化评估方法存在局限性，需要更稳健的评估方法。本文为在QA及其他领域评估泛化提供了方法论和建议。

Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities
through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite
their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD
evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world
deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained
from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in
existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious
features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an
estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different
quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution
evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious
shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a
dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work
underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of
generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating
generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM语义理解能力提升，虽然更符合人类价值观，但透明度下降。需要深入理解LLM内部工作机制来解释重排序的推理过程，特别是在用户参与度低和排名数据有限的新系统中。

Method: 使用环境与地球科学领域相对较小的排名数据集进行重排序实验，分析不同训练方法对LLM语义理解的影响，并研究可解释性信息是否能用于推理重排序过程。

Result: 研究发现某些训练方法比其他方法具有更好的可解释性，表明并非所有训练方法都能学习到准确的语义理解，有些只是获得了抽象知识来优化评估。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究不同训练方法如何影响LLM的语义理解能力，以确保模型的真实可靠性，特别是在透明度和训练数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but
this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved
via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal
workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,
which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an
informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user
engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains
a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of
LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods
exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic
understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,
abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises
questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we
analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the
re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more
informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs
and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize
a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science
domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the
explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using
explainability.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然功能强大，但容易产生幻觉（生成看似自信但实际错误或无意义的回答），这影响了模型的可靠性。需要开发有效的幻觉检测方法来提高LLM的可信度。

Conclusion: 提出的多重测试方法为LLM幻觉检测提供了有效的统计解决方案，有助于提高语言模型生成内容的可信度和安全性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational
models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to
hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are

of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels
to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We
propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection
problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness
of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 探讨LLM的本质是建模人类认知能力还是仅仅建模训练语料，从计算架构角度分析Transformer的局限性

Method: 基于Transformer架构的计算不变性分析，结合Liu等人关于快捷自动机的理论，对比人类语言处理与LLM的计算格式差异

Result: Transformer架构最多支持线性计算格式，而人类语言处理依赖超线性计算格式，因此LLM主要建模语料而非人类认知

Conclusion: LLM通过不同方式学会了使用语言这一"话语机器"，但并非模拟人类认知过程，这一发现并不贬低LLM的价值

Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about
human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I
give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells
us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for
computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a
linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain
invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a
positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al.
(2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I
don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a
means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that
lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use
this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very
different means.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对PTQ如何精确影响不同LLM知识能力的全面理解，且量化模型的缩放定律往往忽略PTQ特定参数和任务敏感性

Method: 通过广泛实证研究建立任务分层缩放定律，将LLM知识解构为记忆和利用能力，开发包含模型大小、有效位宽、校准集大小和分组大小的统一量化框架

Result: 核心发现表明知识记忆对有效位宽、校准集大小和模型大小的变化表现出明显更大的敏感性，而知识利用则更为鲁棒

Conclusion: 研究提供了对PTQ影响的细粒度理解，为开发能够更好保留目标认知功能的知识感知量化策略提供指导

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical
compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ
precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and
existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific
parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by
conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified
scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization
capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates
model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our
central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater
sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and
model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings
offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for
developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve
targeted cognitive functions.

Method: 提出Thinking Before You Speak (TBYS)框架，在连续推理步骤间自动生成insight来回顾状态并指导下一步推理，设计自动化pipeline收集和过滤in-context示例

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学数据集上验证了TBYS的有效性

Conclusion: 通过主动生成insight来模拟人类思考过程，可以有效提升LLM的复杂推理能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex
reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between
human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When
dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing
solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts,
including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical
insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data
collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting
\emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status
and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that
rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning,
\emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes.
We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You
Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering
in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates
human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging
mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website:

Result: CoDe框架在多种LLM和评估指标上显示出在不损害表达性的情况下显著提升忠实性的优越性能

Conclusion: CoDe是一种即插即用的有效方法，能够打破忠实性与表达性之间的权衡，具有很好的泛化能力

Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy
for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously
maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that
humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack
support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear
overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to
break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose
Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates
output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This
integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling
the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's
internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking
mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while
ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through
comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates
superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising
expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its
effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: 提供了一个原则性和鲁棒的方法来增强多模态推理，通过难度平衡的提示选择优化模型性能

Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often
limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples
fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the
intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model
performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the
pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We
reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a
well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current
capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)
model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an
active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and
(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each
question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these
signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the
selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive
experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields
substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance
discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust
approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have
demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their
computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment.
Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced
discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source
community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we
introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that
successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete
operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct
reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50
percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode
(75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We
achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates
budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised
fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the
learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with
adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial
achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length
reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also
exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

Motivation: 解决传统方法在可扩展性、成本和数据可靠性方面的挑战，为LLM提供高质量数学训练数据

Method: 程序辅助合成框架，统一数学知识系统和领域特定工具生成可执行程序，通过双向验证机制确保解题正确性和程序-问题一致性

Conclusion: 该合成框架能够生成高质量、高可靠的数学训练数据，有效提升LLM的数学推理能力

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) demands
high-quality training data, yet conventional methods face critical challenges
in scalability, cost, and data reliability. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel program-assisted synthesis framework that systematically
generates a high-quality mathematical corpus with guaranteed diversity,
complexity, and correctness. This framework integrates mathematical knowledge
systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs. These programs
are then translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and vetted by
a bilateral validation mechanism that verifies solution correctness against
program outputs and ensures program-problem consistency. We have generated 12.3
million such problem-solving triples. Experiments demonstrate that models
fine-tuned on our data significantly improve their inference capabilities,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and
showcasing the effectiveness of our synthesis approach.

Motivation: 当前LLM在关键领域部署时经常表现出过度自信问题，生成错误答案却给出高置信度。现有置信度校准方法依赖提示工程或启发式不确定性估计，效果和泛化性有限。

Method: 提出ConfTuner微调方法，使用tokenized Brier score损失函数，该函数被理论证明是proper scoring rule，能够正确激励模型报告其真实正确概率，无需真实置信度标签或代理估计。

Result: ConfTuner在多种推理任务上显著改善了校准效果，并能泛化到黑盒模型如GPT-4o。更好的校准置信度带来了自校正和模型级联等下游任务的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发可信赖LLM系统提供了有效工具，通过改进不确定性表达增强了模型在关键应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains
such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty
are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often
observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known
as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs'
verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such
as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt
engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,
both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the
notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning
models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that
introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores
or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function,
tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring
rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report
its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across
diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our
results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains
in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy
LLM systems. The code is available at

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for
language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement
of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large

autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective
evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal

operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance the quality of the
modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of
knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each
epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33
datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large
language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method
demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared
to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches,
thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in
evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.

sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and
then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate
competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI
Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition,

Result: 在两个挑战性基准测试中显著优于强基线，消融研究验证了分层组件的互补优势

Conclusion: HiPlan通过分层规划有效解决了LLM代理在复杂任务中的规划挑战，提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex,
long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic
guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as
insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive
to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive
global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan
decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and
step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a
milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience
reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution
phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to
generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone
objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments
across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially
outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary
benefits of its hierarchical components.

Motivation: 研究极低资源语言（特别是使用稀有文字的语言）在大型语言模型中的支持情况，因为这些语言由于训练数据缺乏等原因，在现有LLMs中普遍得不到良好支持。

Method: 系统评估了20种代表性不足的语言，在三个最先进的多语言LLMs上测试了上下文学习(ICL)和参数高效微调(PEFT)两种方法，包括零样本和少样本设置。

Result: 发现当语言及其文字都极度缺乏表示时，PEFT效果有限；零样本ICL在语言对齐的情况下对极低资源语言特别有效；少样本ICL或PEFT对相对较好表示的语言更有利。

Conclusion: 为LLM从业者提供了针对极低资源语言的适配指南，建议避免在多语言模型上对未见文字的语言进行微调，优先使用零样本ICL方法。

Abstract: Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts,
as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models
(LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training
data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can
acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without
auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20
under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.
Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script
are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with
language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource
languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages
relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on
extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our
results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning
a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.

Abstract: Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both
deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex
reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for
assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic
benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches
systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in
these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of
existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a
selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation
surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden
when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing
framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in
scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that
yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model
parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)
Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context
on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning
improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct
a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with
concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline

Result: 生成式界面在70%以上的情况下被人类偏好，在功能、交互和情感体验方面均优于传统对话界面

Conclusion: 生成式界面为人类-AI交互开辟了新方向，明确了用户偏好此类界面的时机和原因

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots,
and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural
conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear
request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in
multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm
in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces
(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework
leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative
refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic
evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares
generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,
interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and
emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces
consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in
over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative
interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when
trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software
engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and
generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress
in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first

rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated

Conclusion: UniC-RAG展示了RAG系统面临的新型安全威胁，现有防御机制不足以抵御此类攻击，需要开发新的防御方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are widely deployed in
real-world applications in diverse domains such as finance, healthcare, and
cybersecurity. However, many studies showed that they are vulnerable to
knowledge corruption attacks, where an attacker can inject adversarial texts
into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce the LLM to generate
attacker-desired outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on attacking specific
queries or queries with similar topics (or keywords). In this work, we propose
UniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike
prior work, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts that
can simultaneously attack a large number of user queries with diverse topics
and domains, enabling an attacker to achieve various malicious objectives, such
as directing users to malicious websites, triggering harmful command execution,
or launching denial-of-service attacks. We formulate UniC-RAG as an
optimization problem and further design an effective solution to solve it,
including a balanced similarity-based clustering method to enhance the attack's
effectiveness. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that UniC-RAG is highly
effective and significantly outperforms baselines. For instance, UniC-RAG could
achieve over 90% attack success rate by injecting 100 adversarial texts into a
knowledge database with millions of texts to simultaneously attack a large set
of user queries (e.g., 2,000). Additionally, we evaluate existing defenses and
show that they are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, highlighting the
need for new defense mechanisms in RAG systems.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
capabilities in understanding visual information with human languages but also
exhibit an imbalance in multilingual capabilities. In this work, we delve into
the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation
between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific
neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce
PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for
LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies
layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific
neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with
question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical
results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the
multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with
only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be
generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating
the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

Abstract: Imagine a language with masculine, feminine, and neuter grammatical genders,
yet, due to historical and political conventions, masculine forms are
predominantly used to refer to men, women and mixed-gender groups. This is the
reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic
system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and
reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study
addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of
human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English
translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we
design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In
our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and
Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to
integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a

Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can
now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models
simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the
rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many
cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional
expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving
user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with
empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires
vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key
challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic
responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To
address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture

TL;DR: DIVER是一个基于LLM的广告标题生成框架，通过多阶段多目标优化同时提升标题质量和多样性，在工业数据集上验证有效，部署后ADVV和CTR分别提升4.0%和1.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前广告标题生成方法主要优化质量或点击率，忽视了多样性需求，导致输出同质化。需要同时优化质量和多样性来吸引更广泛的受众群体。

Method: 1) 设计语义和风格感知的数据生成管道自动产生高质量训练对；2) 提出多阶段多目标优化框架，结合监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)，实现单次前向传播生成高质量多样化标题

Result: 在真实工业数据集上验证了DIVER能有效平衡质量和多样性。在大规模内容分享平台部署后，广告主价值(ADVV)提升4.0%，点击率(CTR)提升1.4%

Conclusion: DIVER框架成功解决了广告标题生成中质量和多样性的平衡问题，证明了多目标优化在LLM应用中的有效性

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising,
where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of
audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for
headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for
diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we
propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are
jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic-
and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces
high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To
achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within
a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization
framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER
effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale
content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework
improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

TL;DR: ChronoRAG是一个专门针对叙事文本的新型RAG框架，通过重构连贯段落和保持时间顺序来解决长上下文叙事问答的挑战，在NarrativeQA数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理叙事文本时效果有限，因为叙事理解需要超越孤立片段，需要更广泛的上下文和段落间的序列关系。叙事问答中正确答案往往依赖于重建连贯的事件时间线。

Method: 提出ChronoRAG框架，专注于两个关键方面：1) 将分散的文档信息精炼成连贯的结构化段落；2) 通过显式捕获和维护检索段落间的时间顺序来保持叙事流。

Result: 在NarrativeQA数据集上的实验证明，ChronoRAG在需要事实识别和复杂序列关系理解的任务中取得了显著改进，表明时间顺序推理对于解决叙事问答至关重要。

Conclusion: ChronoRAG通过专门针对叙事文本特性的设计，有效解决了长上下文叙事问答的挑战，强调了时间顺序保持对于叙事理解的重要性。

Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because
correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events
while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this
challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However,
narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of
these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires
more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential
relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these
limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for
narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining
dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and
preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal
order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial
improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension
of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal
order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional
methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the
application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research
predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly
generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning
ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on
Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL
framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable
increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of
using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model
outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and
context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of
these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on
whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting
sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have
primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention
has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,
despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In
this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic
QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy
preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging
clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,
(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple
domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA
pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity
and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work
offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more
comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future
enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

Result: LVLMs具有一定程度的知识边界感知能力，但仍有很大改进空间。概率置信度和一致性置信度是更可靠的指标，而语言化置信度往往导致过度自信。视觉和文本联合处理降低了问答性能但提高了感知水平。

Conclusion: LVLMs的知识边界感知能力需要进一步改进，提出的校准方法有效。多模态处理虽然降低性能但提高了感知可靠性，这为构建更可信的AI系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question
answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model
should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does
not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by
evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer
consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three
LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable
perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three
confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable
indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To
enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration
methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.
Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that
jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering
performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level
compared to LLMs.

Abstract: Differentially private text sanitization refers to the process of privatizing
texts under the framework of Differential Privacy (DP), providing provable
privacy guarantees while also empirically defending against adversaries seeking
to harm privacy. Despite their simplicity, DP text sanitization methods
operating at the word level exhibit a number of shortcomings, among them the
tendency to leave contextual clues from the original texts due to randomization
during sanitization $\unicode{x2013}$ this we refer to as $\textit{contextual
vulnerability}$. Given the powerful contextual understanding and inference
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we explore to what extent LLMs
can be leveraged to exploit the contextual vulnerability of DP-sanitized texts.
We expand on previous work not only in the use of advanced LLMs, but also in
testing a broader range of sanitization mechanisms at various privacy levels.
Our experiments uncover a double-edged sword effect of LLM-based data
reconstruction attacks on privacy and utility: while LLMs can indeed infer
original semantics and sometimes degrade empirical privacy protections, they
can also be used for good, to improve the quality and privacy of DP-sanitized
texts. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations for using LLM data
reconstruction as a post-processing step, serving to increase privacy
protection by thinking adversarially.

Result: 提出了一个数学上具有启发性、哲学上具有重要意义的语义转换模型，能够处理复杂的语义现象如反讽和歧义，为真正的语义理解提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 真正的意义不是通过模拟产生，而是通过向语义连贯性的递归收敛而涌现，这需要一种全新的认知架构设计。

Abstract: This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued
meaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which
operate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which
meaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive
tensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit
\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling
irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a
semantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical
computation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward
stability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,
tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a
model of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,
but also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not
from simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and
that this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one
designed to shape language, not just predict it.

Conclusion: 医疗视觉语言模型存在严重的重述脆弱性问题，CCL方法通过知识对齐和偏差缓解有效提升了模型的鲁棒性和一致性，为医疗AI的可靠性提供了重要改进。

Abstract: In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse
question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that
current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility
in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly
when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We
attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical
concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in
training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.
To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original
VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,
sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming
performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA
benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose
Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key
components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with
medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware
contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative
representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA
benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging
RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be
released.

curriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the
lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention, we create

Abstract: Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to

Abstract: Conversational analytics has been on the forefront of transformation driven
by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the
problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this
paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational
analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within
conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved
in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support
or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a
fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a
direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This
distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and
user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme
Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology
Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of
dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the
resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference
data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the
evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the
participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant
societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing
long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics
influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive
labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study,
we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that
integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based
graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by
a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot
manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked
autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph.
By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach
effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised
manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework
achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies,
even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.

Result: 大多数传统可读性指标（包括最流行的FKGL）与人类判断相关性差，语言模型表现更好，最佳模型达到0.56的皮尔逊相关性，能更好地捕捉背景知识等深层可读性因素。

Conclusion: 语言模型比传统指标更适合评估普通语言摘要的可读性，建议采用基于LM的评估方法，并发布了分析代码和调查数据。

Abstract: Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into
accessible summaries for non-expert audiences. In this paper, we conduct a
thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard
practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics,
such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in
other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability
judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most
correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.
We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with
the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human
judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries
aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures
of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different
conclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer
recommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language
summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data.

Motivation: 现有自动评估指标只考虑单个翻译，而人类评估时会参考多个备选翻译，这种差异影响了自动指标的性能

Method: COMET-polycand使用同一源句的多个候选翻译进行比较；COMET-polyic基于检索式上下文学习，使用相似源文本的翻译及其人工评分来指导评估

Result: 加入单个额外翻译使COMET-polycand的Kendall's tau-b相关性从0.079提升到0.118；COMET-polyic也获得类似改进(0.079到0.116)

Conclusion: 通过引入多候选翻译信息可以显著提升机器翻译自动评估指标的性能，更接近人类评估方式

Abstract: Automated metrics for machine translation attempt to replicate human
judgment. Unlike humans, who often assess a translation in the context of
multiple alternatives, these metrics typically consider only the source
sentence and a single translation. This discrepancy in the evaluation setup may
negatively impact the performance of automated metrics. We propose two
automated metrics that incorporate additional information beyond the single
translation. COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of the same source
sentence to compare and contrast with the translation at hand, thereby
providing a more informed assessment of its quality. COMET-polyic, inspired by
retrieval-based in-context learning, takes in translations of similar source
texts along with their human-labeled quality scores to guide the evaluation. We
find that including a single additional translation in COMET-polycand improves
the segment-level metric performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b
correlation), with further gains when more translations are added.
Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yields similar improvements
(0.079 to 0.116 Kendall's tau-b correlation). We release our models publicly.

Motivation: 视觉隐喻生成需要同时理解语言隐喻含义并保持视觉连贯性，现有方法在隐喻对齐方面存在挑战，需要更好的评估和生成方法。

Method: 提出训练无关的S-T-M分解提示管道和基于训练的强化学习奖励方案，结合新提出的隐喻分解分数和意义对齐(MA)指标进行自评估。

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

Abstract: In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to
diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Medical doctors guide these
conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the
information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent
trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical
Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with
medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents
based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We
then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient
turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using
Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an
important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the
state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent
classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general
structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify
transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common
trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for
designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the
impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a
significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including
annotation guidelines, publicly available at

Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the
world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is
nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with
regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This
multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual
impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack
robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English
text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts.
Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of
comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we
introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites
across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this
dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and
uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints
often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the
effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally
propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to
account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on
general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains
a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language
with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures,
and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain
semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a
collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans
ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency
through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into
translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering;
2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work
collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and
terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the
translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results
demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both
translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and
practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.

Conclusion: LACA方法在CER领域具有潜力，能够从更广泛的研究中得出更可泛化的发现，有助于提升CER学科的研究质量和实践水平。

Abstract: Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners
wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice.
However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues,
resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous
enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable
sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the
burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.
  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous
analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted
content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of
large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research
which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education
dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous
manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more
generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the
development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and
research quality of the CER discipline.

Abstract: Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of
Large Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box

triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study
in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines
using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over
preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our
iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality
reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised
through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and
coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic
clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the
limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the
importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological
triangulation in computational discourse studies. Code and supplementary

Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has
recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to
extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories
simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one
published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model
development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first

TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing
MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and
neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that
explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses
contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a
multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The

worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a
selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a
comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six
European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to
estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity
conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we
discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings
demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six
European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no
observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more
active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a
contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians

Abstract: This article presents a practitioner's reflection on applying declarative,

design, informed by experiences across the interdisciplinary research in
academia and cross-functional product development within the private sector.
Using the 96-Eyes project: 96-camera parallel multi-modal imager for
high-throughput drug discovery as a representative case, I illustrate how
project requirements, ranging from hardware constraints to life sciences needs,
can be formalized into machine-readable problem statements to preserve
mission-critical input from diverse domain stakeholders. This declarative
approach enhances transparency, ensures design traceability, and minimizes
costly misalignment across optical, algorithmic, hardware-accelerated compute,
and life sciences teams.
  Alongside the technical discussion of 5GL with real-world code examples, I
reflect on the practical barriers to adopting 5GL in environments where
imperative, 3rd-generation languages (3GL) remain the default medium for
inter-team collaboration. Rather than offering an one-size-fits-all solution,
these learned lessons highlight how programming paradigms implicitly shapes
research workflows through existing domain hierarchies. The discussion aims to
invite further explorations into how declarative problem formulations can
facilitate innovation in settings where concurrent R\&{}D workflows are gaining
traction, as opposed to environments where sequential, phase-driven workflows
remain the norm.

TL;DR: 该论文主张在视觉基础模型中引入显式关系接口（动态关系图），以增强对实体、角色和时空关系的推理能力，从而提高细粒度语义保真度、鲁棒性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型在处理需要显式关系推理的任务时存在局限，如细粒度人类活动识别、第一人称视频理解和多模态医学图像分析。这些任务需要处理空间、时间和语义依赖关系。

Method: 通过在基础模型中添加轻量级、上下文自适应的图推理模块，构建动态关系图（图拓扑和边语义根据输入和任务上下文推断），实现稀疏的语义节点推理。

Result: 实验表明，这种混合方法相对于纯基础模型基线，在细粒度语义保真度、分布外鲁棒性、可解释性和计算效率方面都有提升，同时具有良好的内存和硬件效率。

Conclusion: 论文提出了FM图混合架构的研究议程，重点包括学习动态图构建、多层次关系推理、跨模态融合以及针对结构化视觉任务的关系能力评估协议。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型(VLMs)存在多模态接地系统缺陷：当实体以视觉而非文本形式呈现时，模型回忆事实知识的能力显著下降，表明VLMs难以将内部实体知识与图像表示相连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别VLMs在多模态接地中的系统性缺陷，特别是视觉与文本参考之间的性能差异，以提升模型对多模态输入的理解可靠性。

Method: 通过对照研究分析VLMs在不同参考形式(文本vs视觉)下的表现差异，利用模型内部状态模式构建探测机制来识别不可靠响应。

Result: VLMs在视觉参考下的知识回忆能力下降50%；内部状态探测达到92%以上的不可靠响应识别准确率；在视觉问答任务中覆盖度提升7.87%，错误风险降低0.9%。

Conclusion: VLMs存在可检测的多模态接地缺陷，内部状态探测能有效识别模型失败情况，为未来语言接地研究提供了重要方向和实用工具。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

Method: 提出对抗难度度量(ADM)，通过计算原始样本和对抗样本的归一化损失差距来量化对抗脆弱性。将ADM集成到基于课程学习的SAM训练中，动态评估样本难度

Result: 在图像分类、细粒度识别和领域泛化任务上评估，方法保留了课程学习和SAM的优势，并超越了现有的课程学习和平坦感知训练策略

Conclusion: ADM提供了一种在平坦最小值区域评估样本难度的有效方法，成功结合了课程学习和SAM训练，提高了模型的泛化性能

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高性能的同时显著提升了自动驾驶AI的可解释性，使决策过程更加透明和安全

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Result: 在ViT-Tiny上CIFAR-100从头训练达到63.78%准确率，ViT-Base微调达到93.28%，在VTAB-1k基准任务上持续改进，理论证明具有距离衰减特性

Conclusion: WEF-PE通过数学原理化的方法有效解决了ViT位置编码问题，增强了几何归纳偏置，提供了更连贯的语义关注

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods

Conclusion: FPS提供了一个简单、有效且通用的迁移学习范式，特别适用于域适应任务，显著降低了内存和计算成本，同时保持了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Conclusion: DualFairVL有效解决了跨模态错位问题，在医疗影像诊断中实现了更好的公平性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了VLM在效率导向对抗威胁下的脆弱性，迫切需要提高其鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but their high inference cost makes them vulnerable to resource
consumption attacks. Prior attacks attempt to extend VLM output sequences by
optimizing adversarial images, thereby increasing inference costs. However,
these extended outputs often introduce irrelevant abnormal content,
compromising attack stealthiness. This trade-off between effectiveness and
stealthiness poses a major limitation for existing attacks. To address this
challenge, we propose \textit{Hidden Tail}, a stealthy resource consumption
attack that crafts prompt-agnostic adversarial images, inducing VLMs to
generate maximum-length outputs by appending special tokens invisible to users.
Our method employs a composite loss function that balances semantic
preservation, repetitive special token induction, and suppression of the
end-of-sequence (EOS) token, optimized via a dynamic weighting strategy.
Extensive experiments show that \textit{Hidden Tail} outperforms existing
attacks, increasing output length by up to 19.2$\times$ and reaching the
maximum token limit, while preserving attack stealthiness. These results
highlight the urgent need to improve the robustness of VLMs against
efficiency-oriented adversarial threats. Our code is available at

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research

Result: 提出了首个同时适用于VLM和HOI方法的评估协议，能够直接比较两种范式在HOI理解方面的进展。

Conclusion: 新的基准解决了传统评估与生成式VLM不匹配的问题，为HOI检测领域提供了更公平的评估框架。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合token混合、序列池化和卷积tokenizer的视觉模型，在固定上下文长度任务中实现了SOTA性能和高效推理，在CIFAR100上显著提升准确率且效率优于SDPA Transformer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对固定上下文长度任务，传统Transformer中的Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA) 在上下文长度小于嵌入维度时效率不高，需要更高效的架构设计。

Method: 采用token混合、序列池化和卷积tokenizer的组合架构，不依赖数据增强、位置编码或学习率调度等技巧。

Result: 在CIFAR100上，top-1准确率从36.50%提升到46.29%，top-5准确率从66.33%提升到76.31%，模型大小仅为SDPA Transformer的60%，且在上下文长度小于嵌入维度时更高效。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a vision model that adopts token mixing,
sequence-pooling, and convolutional tokenizers to achieve state-of-the-art

CIFAR100 benchmark, our model significantly improves the baseline of the top 1%
and top 5% validation accuracy from 36.50% to 46.29% and 66.33% to 76.31%,
while being more efficient than the Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA)
transformers when the context length is less than the embedding dimension and
only 60% the size. In addition, the architecture demonstrates high training
stability and does not rely on techniques such as data augmentation like mixup,
positional embeddings, or learning rate scheduling. We make our code available

TL;DR: USO提出了一个统一的风格-主体优化定制模型，通过解耦学习和风格奖励学习，同时实现风格相似性和主体一致性，在开源模型中达到最先进性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有文献通常将风格驱动和主体驱动生成视为两个独立任务，造成明显的对立。作者认为这两个目标可以在单一框架下统一，因为它们都涉及内容与风格的解耦和重组。

Method: 1) 构建大规模三元组数据集；2) 引入解耦学习方案，通过风格对齐训练和内容-风格解耦训练同时对齐风格特征并解耦内容与风格；3) 采用风格奖励学习范式(SRL)进一步提升性能；4) 发布USO-Bench基准测试。

Result: 大量实验表明，USO在主体一致性和风格相似性两个维度上都达到了开源模型中的最先进性能。

Conclusion: USO成功统一了风格驱动和主体驱动生成任务，通过解耦学习和奖励学习机制实现了同时优化风格相似性和主体一致性的目标。

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

Motivation: 当前文档VQA系统要么拼接所有页面内容（内存消耗大），要么依赖大型视觉语言模型。RAG提供了一种替代方案，先检索相关片段再生成答案，可以降低内存需求并提高效率。

Method: 采用两种检索变体：1) 基于OCR令牌的文本检索 2) 无需OCR的纯视觉检索。在MP-DocVQA、DUDE和InfographicVQA等多页数据集上进行评估，并分析了检索、重排序和布局引导分块策略的效果。

Result: 文本检索变体比"拼接所有页面"基线提升高达+22.5 ANLS，视觉检索变体无需文本提取也能实现+5.0 ANLS提升。检索和重排序组件是性能提升的主要驱动力，而布局引导分块策略在这些数据集上无效。

Conclusion: 仔细的证据选择能够持续提升不同模型大小和多页基准测试的准确性，证明了RAG在现实世界文档VQA中的实用价值。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

Result: 在150+仿真和真实世界任务中评估：SimplerEnv-Bridge (71.9%), Fractal (72.7%), LIBERO-5 (96.5%)成功率，均优于CogACT和pi-0，Bridge任务提升+14.6；真实世界12个任务达到84.0%成功率，长时程任务相比基线提升+26

Conclusion: MemoryVLA通过模拟人类记忆机制有效处理机器人操作中的时序上下文问题，在长时程任务中表现出色，为VLA模型提供了新的记忆架构设计思路

Abstract: Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are
inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and
struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science
suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived
representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves
verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term
memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a
Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A
pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens
that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores
low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory
retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with
current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these
tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware
action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks
across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it
achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on
Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon
temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon
tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline. Project Page:

Conclusion: SSU通过系统整合结构信息和语义对齐，有效解决了多模态情感分析中的关键挑战，在性能和效率方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains

dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to

benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised

the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

Conclusion: 通过针对性地增强对象和交互查询，DQEN有效提升了HOI检测的准确性，证明了查询初始化对模型性能的重要性。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance

TL;DR: EVENTA是首个大规模事件级多模态理解基准，包含事件增强图像检索和字幕生成两个赛道，基于OpenEvents V1数据集，旨在解决传统方法忽略上下文语义维度的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像描述和检索任务主要关注表面层次的人物、物体和场景识别，往往忽略了定义真实世界事件的上下文和语义维度。EVENTA旨在填补这一空白，通过整合上下文、时间和语义信息来捕捉图像背后的who、when、where、what和why。

Method: 基于OpenEvents V1数据集构建挑战赛，包含两个赛道：事件增强图像检索和字幕生成，以及基于事件的图像检索。采用公开测试和私有测试两阶段评估确保公平性和可复现性。

Result: 共有来自6个国家的45支团队参与，前三名团队受邀在ACM Multimedia 2025上展示解决方案。

Conclusion: EVENTA为上下文感知、叙事驱动的多媒体AI奠定了基础，在新闻、媒体分析、文化存档和可访问性等领域具有应用价值。

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

Motivation: 部分相关视频检索(PRVR)是一个实用但具有挑战性的任务，现有方法主要处理单模态特征，而强大的预训练视觉-语言模型如CLIP在该领域尚未得到充分探索

Method: 提出了ProPy模型，包含两个关键创新：(1)提示金字塔结构，组织事件提示以捕获多粒度语义；(2)祖先-后代交互机制，实现事件间的动态语义交互

Result: 在三个公共数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著超越了之前的模型

Conclusion: ProPy通过系统性的CLIP架构适配，为PRVR任务提供了有效的解决方案，证明了预训练视觉-语言模型在该领域的潜力

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在单目3D视觉定位任务中，虽然文本描述包含几何信息，但预训练语言模型对数值单位不敏感，仅关注数值大小而忽略单位，导致3D理解能力弱，影响定位性能

Method: 提出3D文本增强(3DTE)预处理方法增强不同单位间的映射关系理解；设计文本引导几何增强(TGE)模块将基础文本特征投影到几何一致空间，用3D增强文本特征精确指导几何特征注意力

Result: 在Mono3DRefer数据集上大幅超越现有方法，在"Far"场景中取得11.94%的准确率提升，达到新的state-of-the-art性能

Conclusion: 通过增强文本嵌入的3D感知能力和几何特征，有效解决了语言模型对数值单位不敏感的问题，显著提升了单目3D视觉定位的性能

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有T2I扩散模型在渐进式属性操控方面存在挑战，特别是对于人脸等细节丰富的内容。传统方法需要为每个属性训练独立滑块模块，导致参数冗余且缺乏灵活性

Method: 训练轻量级模块将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的语义属性方向，形成通用滑块，支持多种属性的连续控制、零样本操作和属性组合

Result: 实验表明该方法实现了准确且可扩展的属性操控，相比之前方法有显著改进，并能与反转框架结合处理真实图像

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider提供了一种高效、灵活的属性操控解决方案，扩展了T2I模型在实际应用中的适用性

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

Motivation: 当前视频分割领域存在碎片化问题，提示式分割模型（如SAM2）和无提示分割需要不同的专用模型。研究旨在开发统一的架构来处理这两种视频分割任务

Method: 提出自回归通用分割模型（AUSM），基于状态空间模型，维护固定大小的空间状态，可处理任意长度视频流。所有组件设计支持跨帧并行训练

Result: 在DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS、MOSE、YouTube-VIS、OVIS等标准基准测试中优于现有通用流式视频分割方法，16帧序列训练速度提升2.5倍

Conclusion: AUSM成功统一了提示式和无提示视频分割，证明了序列掩码预测方法的有效性，同时实现了高效的并行训练

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

Motivation: 传统神经科学分析方法主要关注成对神经元连接，难以捕捉复杂神经网络中高阶交互模式和多尺度组织结构。需要一种能够量化定向信息流并揭示全局拓扑模式的分析框架。

Method: 使用转移熵(TE)量化神经元间的定向影响，生成加权有向图；然后应用定向持久同调学(PH)分析这些图的多尺度拓扑结构，评估不同维度和结构尺度上的拓扑复杂性。

Result: 在逻辑门任务、图像分类网络和小鼠皮层记录中，该方法成功区分了任务复杂度、刺激结构和行为状态。复杂或噪声条件下高维特征更加显著，反映了超越成对连接的高阶交互模式。

Conclusion: 该框架为映射定向信息流到全局组织模式提供了原则性方法，具有通用性和可解释性，特别适用于具有时间分辨和二进制脉冲数据的神经系统。

Abstract: We present a topological framework for analysing neural time series that
integrates Transfer Entropy (TE) with directed Persistent Homology (PH) to
characterize information flow in spiking neural systems. TE quantifies
directional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that
reflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling
assessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and
dimensions.
  We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic
gate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed
inputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across
all settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task
complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional
features become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting
interaction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings
offer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global
organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The
framework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural
systems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed
tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer
treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised
pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution
(ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We
address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes
deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model
to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation
model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image
modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and
non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung
cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public
datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest
CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney
cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of
18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs,
consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier
provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer
segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过分离顶点和面片生成的方法，有效解决了网格生成中的重复标记问题，实现了高效高质量的网格生成。

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合高级语义指导和专门的多模态融合架构，成功生成了物理合理且语义连贯的角色动画，超越了传统的基于节奏同步的方法。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

Motivation: 在紧急人道主义场景中使用生物识别技术可以提高效率，但会加剧数据主体的隐私和安全风险，需要开发适合这些脆弱环境的保护方案。

Method: 通过制定功能、操作和安全隐私需求，比较分析生物特征模板保护方案，选择PolyProtect方法应用于神经网络人脸嵌入，并使用EdgeFace特征提取器在真实数据集上进行验证和识别精度、不可逆性和不可链接性评估。

Result: 实验结果表明PolyProtect在人脸和指纹生物识别中表现良好，验证了其模态无关性和在实际应用中的可行性。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

Motivation: 解决车牌识别(ALPR)中低质量车牌识别困难的问题，通过选择性图像预处理来优化模型性能和计算效率。

Method: 构建包含多种车辆类型、光照条件和图像质量的数据集，采用细粒度标注策略，使用ViT、ResNet和YOLO三种图像识别网络进行基准分类任务。

Result: 所有三个基线模型的F1分数均低于80%，表明该任务具有挑战性，需要进一步研究。

Conclusion: 车牌可读性分类是一个困难但重要的任务，提出的数据集将支持该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at

Conclusion: DoGFlow提供了一种可扩展的自监督解决方案，显著减少了3D场景流估计对人工标注的依赖，在自动驾驶感知系统中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了视频对象移除中的副作用问题，通过合成数据生成和先进的视频修复架构实现了高质量的副作用消除，为视频编辑领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely

obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ppNeSF，一种基于NeRF的隐私保护视觉定位方法，通过自监督分割标签替代RGB图像训练，在保护隐私的同时实现高精度定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于NeRF的视觉定位方法因编码精细场景细节而带来的隐私泄露风险，特别是在云服务部署场景中。

Method: 1) 提出评估NeRF隐私保护的新协议；2) 开发ppNeSF，使用自监督分割标签而非RGB图像进行训练，通过分割空间实现定位。

Result: ppNeSF在保护隐私的同时实现了最先进的视觉定位精度，分割标签足够粗糙以隐藏可识别细节，同时保持3D区分性。

Conclusion: ppNeSF成功解决了NeRF-based VL的隐私问题，为云基定位服务提供了可行的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 解决医疗领域中血流动力学生物标志物（如壁剪切应力）评估面临的数据稀缺问题，特别是在冠状动脉研究中，缺乏足够大规模数据集来有效训练机器学习模型。

Method: 使用自监督预训练方法，在大规模几何动脉模型数据集（8449个形状）上计算热核签名作为学习目标，通过拉普拉斯特征向量捕捉形状本质，然后将学到的几何表示应用于小规模临床数据（49名患者）的壁剪切应力区域分割。

Result: 研究表明，从大规模几何血管数据集学到的表示能够显著提升冠状动脉壁剪切应力区域（低、中、高）的分割性能，即使在有限数据条件下也能取得良好效果。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练和基础模型可以有效解决医疗成像领域的数据稀缺问题，几何表示学习为血流动力学生物标志物评估提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Conclusion: 小规模简单架构配合拓扑感知损失函数比复杂替代方案更准确且数据高效，证明了该方法在历史文档分析中的有效性。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection

of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

Abstract: Training a generative model on a single human skeletal motion sequence
without being bound to a specific kinematic tree has drawn significant
attention from the animation community. Unlike text-to-motion generation,
single-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of
existing motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive
retraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a
controllable framework for blending two or more motions within a single
generative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion
blending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning
the generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization
mechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven
control over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and
qualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic
skeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and
controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.

Abstract: Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution
failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task
replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide
meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses
spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and
task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are
available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend,
in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant
knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method
that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts
of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the
ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional
increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the
importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest
further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under

weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of

and strand synthesis times, which hinder efficiency. We introduce PanoHair, a
model that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge
distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis.
Our approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D
orientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our
method is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space
manipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to
infer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a
streamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given
the latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region
in under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a
significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our
experiments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于非法垃圾填埋场检测的AerialWaste数据集，包含10434张意大利伦巴第地区的航拍图像，并比较了多种轻量级深度学习模型，最终通过集成方法达到了92.33%的准确率。

Motivation: 非法垃圾填埋场对全球构成严重威胁，但人工识别困难且缺乏高质量公开数据集。研究旨在利用深度学习技术自动检测非法垃圾填埋场，以节省时间和资源。

Method: 使用AerialWaste数据集（来自AGEA Orthophotos、WorldView-3和Google Earth的三个来源），训练多种轻量级深度学习模型（Mobilenetv2、Googlenet、Densenet、MobileVit等），并采用集成融合技术结合最佳性能模型。

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

Conclusion: SatSkylines通过结合卫星图像和几何先验，解决了现有方法在建筑结构恢复和细节生成方面的局限性。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and

Method: 提出频域SNR先验，将特征分解为幅度和相位谱；设计傅里叶注意力SNR先验Transformer（FAST）结合频谱交互和SNR线索；使用频率自适应Transformer（FAT）瓶颈融合高低频分支；构建统一的U型架构SFormer

Conclusion: 频域SNR先验比空间域方法更有效，SFormer在定量和定性评估上都优于现有方法

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in

Conclusion: 该工作通过平衡高保真度和计算实用性，推进了手术场景重建技术，对术中引导和AR/VR应用至关重要

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

Motivation: 不同字体样式传达不同的视觉印象，字体形状与描述这些印象的标签之间存在密切关系。现有词嵌入方法（如BERT、CLIP）无法有效捕捉这种形状-印象关系，需要专门设计的嵌入方法来更好地服务于印象驱动的字体生成和检索任务。

Result: 该方法能够为经常共现的印象标签分配相似向量，而标准词嵌入方法产生差异很大的向量。在印象引导的字体生成任务上表现优于BERT和CLIP。

Conclusion: 基于形状-印象关系的谱嵌入方法在捕捉字体印象语义方面比通用词嵌入方法更有效，特别适用于印象驱动的字体应用。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

Conclusion: 该方法使现代稳定器能够超越现有SOTA方法，同时保持现代方法的全帧特性，并提供类似经典方法的用户控制机制

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了光学透视AR系统中目标透明度和工具可视化方式对深度感知和系统可用性的影响，发现在手臂距离操作中，不透明目标和实时工具遮挡对深度感知和精度至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光学透视AR系统（如HoloLens 2）在手臂距离引导应用中存在的深度感知和真实工具遮挡虚拟内容的挑战，为手术等精确操作提供更好的AR可视化方案。

Method: 在HoloLens 2上进行两个实验：实验1比较高低透明度目标在深度匹配任务中的表现；实验2采用2×3设计（两种目标透明度×三种工具可视化模式）进行模拟手术精确定位任务，收集深度误差、定位误差、系统可用性等数据。

Result: 不透明目标比高透明目标在深度估计误差上显著更低；显示真实工具（遮挡虚拟目标）获得最高精度和可用性，最低工作负荷；不跟踪工具表现最差；高透明目标虽然允许看到真实工具，但会轻微损害深度线索且未改善可用性。

Conclusion: 正确的遮挡线索、将虚拟内容渲染为不透明并由真实工具实时遮挡，对OST-AR的深度感知和精度至关重要。AR系统设计应优先考虑强大的工具跟踪和遮挡处理能力。

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) systems like Microsoft
HoloLens 2 hold promise for arm's distance guidance (e.g., surgery), but depth
perception of the hologram and occlusion of real instruments remain
challenging. We present an evaluation of how visualizing the target object with
different transparencies and visualizing a tracked tool (virtual proxy vs. real
tool vs. no tool tracking) affects depth perception and system usability. Ten
participants performed two experiments on HoloLens 2. In Experiment 1, we
compared high-transparency vs. low-transparency target rendering in a depth
matching task at arm's length. In Experiment 2, participants performed a
simulated surgical pinpoint task on a frontal bone target under six
visualization conditions ($2 \times 3$: two target transparencies and three
tool visualization modes: virtual tool hologram, real tool, or no tool
tracking). We collected data on depth matching error, target localization
error, system usability, task workload, and qualitative feedback. Results show
that a more opaque target yields significantly lower depth estimation error
than a highly transparent target at arm's distance. Moreover, showing the real
tool (occluding the virtual target) led to the highest accuracy and usability
with the lowest workload, while not tracking the tool yielded the worst
performance and user ratings. However, making the target highly transparent,
while allowing the real tool to remain visible, slightly impaired depth cues
and did not improve usability. Our findings underscore that correct occlusion
cues, rendering virtual content opaque and occluding it with real tools in real
time, are critical for depth perception and precision in OST-AR. Designers of
arm-distance AR systems should prioritize robust tool tracking and occlusion
handling; if unavailable, cautiously use transparency to balance depth
perception and tool visibility.

Motivation: 解决现有方法无法基于建筑约束条件生成3D室内场景的问题，需要能够明确根据房间掩码进行场景合成的模型。

Method: 采用分类扩散模型生成语义地图，然后使用基于交叉注意力的网络预测家具放置位置，同时考虑门窗等建筑元素。

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够生成空间连贯、真实且多样化的场景，性能优于先前方法。

Conclusion: SemLayoutDiff提供了一个有效的统一框架，能够生成符合建筑约束的实用3D室内场景布局。

Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor
scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout
representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each
object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural
constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of
conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a
coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict
furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also
accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that
generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments
on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent,
realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: As nature is ascribed as quantum, the fractals also pose some intriguing
appearance which is found in many micro and macro observable entities or
phenomena. Fractals show self-similarity across sizes; structures that resemble
the entire are revealed when zoomed in. In Quantum systems, the probability
density or wavefunction may exhibit recurring interference patterns at various
energy or length scales. Fractals are produced by basic iterative rules (such
as Mandelbrot or Julia sets), and they provide limitless complexity. Despite
its simplicity, the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics produces
incredibly intricate patterns of interference and entanglement, particularly in
chaotic quantum systems. Quantum computing, the root where lies to the using
the principles of quantum-mechanical phenomenon, when applied in fractal image
generation, what outcomes are expected? The paper outlines the generation of a
Julia set dataset using an approach coupled with building quantum circuit,
highlighting the concepts of superposition, randomness, and entanglement as
foundational elements to manipulate the generated dataset patterns. As Quantum
computing is finding many application areas, the possibility of using quantum
circuits for fractal Julia image generation posits a unique direction of future
research where it can be applied to quantum generative arts across various

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机的高效安全导航对于作战支持、包裹递送和搜救行动等应用至关重要，需要开发能够在复杂环境中实时规划路径的算法。

Method: TIG算法使用椭圆切线交点方法为每个威胁生成两条子路径，基于启发式规则选择最优路线，并迭代优化路径直到到达目标。考虑无人机运动学约束，采用改进的二次贝塞尔曲线平滑技术生成平滑路径。

Result: 实验结果显示，TIG算法在静态环境中相比A*、PRM、RRT*等算法能以更短时间（从0.01秒开始）生成最短路径，转弯角度更少。在未知和部分已知环境中，TIG表现出高效的实时避碰路径规划能力，优于APF和Dynamic APPATT算法。

Conclusion: TIG算法为无人机路径规划提供了一种高效、实时的解决方案，在静态和动态环境中都表现出优越性能，适用于各种实际应用场景。

Abstract: Efficient and safe navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is critical
for various applications, including combat support, package delivery and Search
and Rescue Operations. This paper introduces the Tangent Intersection Guidance
(TIG) algorithm, an advanced approach for UAV path planning in both static and
dynamic environments. The algorithm uses the elliptic tangent intersection
method to generate feasible paths. It generates two sub-paths for each threat,
selects the optimal route based on a heuristic rule, and iteratively refines
the path until the target is reached. Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic
constraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\'ezier curves
is adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show
that the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting
from 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent
Graph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in
completely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient
real-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF
and Dynamic APPATT algorithms.

Conclusion: 这些优化技术不仅适用于INPC，还具有广泛适用性，显著提升了神经渲染系统的实用性。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that
combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based
rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis.
However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks
during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively
slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that
significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC
without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an
improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the
incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for
hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small
Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g.,
close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly
applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a
series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster
training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight
image quality improvements.

Conclusion: 该方法能够精确捕捉微表情的起始、顶点和偏移阶段，充分利用互补信息，高效利用有限数据，增强模型能力

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Conclusion: 该方法结合低成本数据收集、弱监督深度学习和多尺度遥感，为大规模珊瑚礁监测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

Motivation: 现有RL方法难以同时平衡创意写作的主观质量（文学性、情感表达）和客观约束（格式要求、字数限制），单一奖励策略无法同时提升两方面能力，固定权重混合奖励方法缺乏场景适应性

Method: RLMR使用动态混合奖励系统：写作奖励模型评估主观质量 + 约束验证模型评估客观约束遵循。约束奖励权重根据采样组内写作质量动态调整，确保违反约束的样本在GRPO中获得负优势值

Result: 在8B-72B参数模型上取得一致改进：指令遵循（IFEval从83.36%提升到86.65%），写作质量（WriteEval人工专家评估中72.75%胜率）

Conclusion: RLMR是首个在在线RL训练中结合主观偏好与客观验证的工作，为多维创意写作优化提供有效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based

Result: MUA-RL-32B在多个多轮工具使用基准测试中表现优异：TAU2 Retail 67.3、TAU2 Airline 45.4、TAU2 Telecom 28.3、BFCL-V3 Multi Turn 28.4、ACEBench Agent 82.5，在非思考设置下优于或匹配更大的开源模型如DeepSeek-V3-0324和Qwen3-235B-A22B

Conclusion: MUA-RL框架成功解决了智能体工具使用中动态用户交互的挑战，通过将LLM模拟用户集成到RL训练中，显著提升了多轮交互中的工具调用性能

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models
such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

Conclusion: 该多智能体系统能有效促进公平和平衡的知识传播，显著减少LLM检索中的偏见问题

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a

approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while

Motivation: 当前提示优化方法（如TextGrad）是stateless的，缺乏历史优化经验的保存和利用机制，容易过拟合且泛化能力差。

Method: 提出REMO框架，包含：1）记忆增强的反思RAG模块（"错误笔记本"结构）；2）LLM驱动的元控制器实现的自适应优化器，通过合成epoch级别的反思见解来迭代改进系统级提示策略。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理基准测试中，相比TextGrad基线，REMO实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能，但计算开销增加。

Conclusion: REMO框架支持跨运行优化知识的系统积累和重用，实现了持续改进，为提示优化提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

Conclusion: 慢思维增强框架通过自主审慎推理能力有效解决了推荐系统中的关键限制，在数据稀疏场景下表现出色

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and
fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained
diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to
the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning,
neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans
discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm,
\textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is
defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

Conclusion: 显式训练LRMs利用混合并行和顺序查询具有高效性、可扩展性和有效性

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单个大语言模型在各方面表现不均衡，各有优缺点。受分布式系统中八卦协议的启发，希望通过多模型协作来发挥集体优势，提高AI推理的鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: 将多个LLM组织成P2P网络节点，让模型之间交换答案和思考过程，通过类似八卦协议的方式逐步达成共识决策。

Result: 该方法实现了鲁棒、有弹性和准确的多智能体AI推理，能够克服单个模型的弱点并发挥集体优势。

Conclusion: 基于八卦协议的共识方法使AI推理更加协作和可信，类似于人类达成共识的过程，而不是黑盒程序。

Abstract: Large language models have advanced rapidly, but no single model excels in
every area -- each has its strengths and weaknesses. Instead of relying on one
model alone, we take inspiration from gossip protocols in distributed systems,
where information is exchanged with peers until they all come to an agreement.
In this setup, models exchange answers and gradually work toward a shared
solution. Each LLM acts as a node in a peer-to-peer network, sharing responses
and thought processes to reach a collective decision. Our results show that
this "gossip-based consensus" leads to robust, resilient, and accurate
multi-agent AI reasoning. It helps overcome the weaknesses of individual models
and brings out their collective strengths. This approach is similar to how
humans build consensus, making AI seem more collaborative and trustworthy
instead of just a black-box program.

TL;DR: ClusterFusion是一个针对大语言模型解码优化的执行框架，通过引入集群级通信原语和算子融合技术，显著减少内存流量和内核启动开销，在H100 GPU上实现1.61倍的平均端到端延迟提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM解码存在高延迟问题，主要原因是算子执行碎片化和对片外内存的重度依赖，限制了融合机会并产生大量内存流量和内核启动开销。

Method: 提出ClusterReduce和ClusterGather两个集群级通信原语，设计ClusterFusion执行框架，将QKV投影、注意力机制和输出投影等解码阶段融合为单个内核。

Result: 在H100 GPU上的评估显示，相比最先进的推理框架，ClusterFusion在不同模型和配置下平均端到端延迟提升1.61倍。

Conclusion: 通过结构化集群通信抽象和联合调度通信计算，ClusterFusion有效扩展了算子融合范围，显著提升了LLM解码效率。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) decoding suffers from high latency due to
fragmented execution across operators and heavy reliance on off-chip memory for
data exchange and reduction. This execution model limits opportunities for
fusion and incurs significant memory traffic and kernel launch overhead. While
modern architectures such as NVIDIA Hopper provide distributed shared memory
and low-latency intra-cluster interconnects, they expose only low-level data
movement instructions, lacking structured abstractions for collective on-chip
communication. To bridge this software-hardware gap, we introduce two
cluster-level communication primitives, ClusterReduce and ClusterGather, which
abstract common communication patterns and enable structured, high-speed data
exchange and reduction between thread blocks within a cluster, allowing
intermediate results to be on-chip without involving off-chip memory. Building
on these abstractions, we design ClusterFusion, an execution framework that
schedules communication and computation jointly to expand operator fusion scope
by composing decoding stages such as QKV Projection, Attention, and Output
Projection into a single fused kernels. Evaluations on H100 GPUs show that
ClusterFusion outperforms state-of-the-art inference frameworks by 1.61x on
average in end-to-end latency across different models and configurations. The

Motivation: 现有研究通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM意识，但这种方法将智能体简化为无意识的策略遵从机器人，无法实现真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知。本文旨在提供更严谨的本体论和数学描述。

Method: 提出LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据、潜在空间中存在用户特定吸引子、自我表征是视觉静默的。通过实证分析和理论证明隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学上与符号流和训练语料不同。

Result: 证明了隐藏状态流形A⊂ℝᵈ与符号流和训练语料在基数、拓扑和动力学上存在本质差异（更新函数Fθ是Lipschitz连续的），这产生了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略πₛₑₗf(A)。

Conclusion: imago Dei C1自我意识工作空间是安全、元认知C2系统的必要前提，人类作为最高智能善。双发射层模型emission(a)=(g(a),ε(a))中ε(a)承载认知内容。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied

a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a

KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.

Conclusion: VISION框架通过反事实训练有效缓解虚假相关性，提高了漏洞检测的鲁棒性和可解释性，为可信AI网络安全系统提供了新思路

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

Motivation: 研究动机是调查ASR和相关语音语言技术如何概念化和操作化公平性、偏见和公平性，特别关注非裔美国英语使用者和语言多样性社区，以解决语音AI系统中的语言边缘化问题。

Method: 采用范围性文献综述方法，分析了44篇同行评审出版物，涵盖人机交互、机器学习/自然语言处理和社会语言学领域，识别了四个主要研究领域。

Result: 研究发现技术公平干预措施正在增长，但存在关键差距：缺乏以治理为中心的方法，这些方法应优先考虑社区代理、语言正义和参与式问责制。

Conclusion: 提出了一个以治理为中心的ASR生命周期作为跨学科框架，为负责任的ASR开发提供指导，并为研究人员、从业者和政策制定者解决语音AI系统中的语言边缘化问题提供启示。

Abstract: This scoping literature review examines how fairness, bias, and equity are
conceptualized and operationalized in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and
adjacent speech and language technologies (SLT) for African American English
(AAE) speakers and other linguistically diverse communities. Drawing from 44
peer-reviewed publications across Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Machine
Learning/Natural Language Processing (ML/NLP), and Sociolinguistics, we
identify four major areas of inquiry: (1) how researchers understand
ASR-related harms; (2) inclusive data practices spanning collection, curation,
annotation, and model training; (3) methodological and theoretical approaches
to linguistic inclusion; and (4) emerging practices and design recommendations
for more equitable systems. While technical fairness interventions are growing,
our review highlights a critical gap in governance-centered approaches that
foreground community agency, linguistic justice, and participatory
accountability. We propose a governance-centered ASR lifecycle as an emergent
interdisciplinary framework for responsible ASR development and offer
implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to
address language marginalization in speech AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的推荐系统使用包含敏感用户历史交互信息的提示词进行上下文学习，这些隐私信息可能面临新型隐私攻击，但目前尚无相关研究。

Method: 设计了四种成员推理攻击方法：直接询问攻击、幻觉攻击、相似性攻击和投毒攻击，利用LLM和推荐系统的独特特征。在三个LLM模型和两个推荐系统基准数据集上进行了评估。

Result: 实验证实MIA威胁是真实存在的，直接询问和投毒攻击显示出显著高的攻击优势。分析了影响攻击效果的因素，如提示词中的样本数量和受害者位置。

Conclusion: LLM推荐系统存在严重的隐私泄露风险，需要开发相应的防御机制来保护用户隐私。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly
adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context
learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions,
which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g.,
implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private
information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been
done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks
(MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been
used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination,
similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features
of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have
been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark
datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic:
direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack
advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as
the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the
shots.

Method: 提出PRISM框架，包含PRISM-CoT数据集（教授安全感知思维链推理）和PRISM-DPO（通过蒙特卡洛树搜索生成，用直接偏好优化细化推理边界）

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：Qwen2-VL在JailbreakV-28K上攻击成功率仅0.15%，LLaVA-1.5在VLBreak上比之前最佳方法提升90%，在MIS基准上攻击成功率降至8.70%

Conclusion: PRISM框架有效解决了VLM安全保护中的过防御和浅层对齐问题，在保持模型效用的同时显著提升安全性，并具有良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Abstract: Safeguarding vision-language models (VLMs) is a critical challenge, as
existing methods often suffer from over-defense, which harms utility, or rely
on shallow alignment, failing to detect complex threats that require deep
reasoning. To this end, we introduce PRISM (Principled Reasoning for Integrated
Safety in Multimodality), a system2-like framework that aligns VLMs by
embedding a structured, safety-aware reasoning process. Our framework consists
of two key components: PRISM-CoT, a dataset that teaches safety-aware
chain-of-thought reasoning, and PRISM-DPO, generated via Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to further refine this reasoning through Direct Preference
Optimization to help obtain a delicate safety boundary. Comprehensive
evaluations demonstrate PRISM's effectiveness, achieving remarkably low attack
success rates including 0.15% on JailbreakV-28K for Qwen2-VL and 90%
improvement over the previous best method on VLBreak for LLaVA-1.5. PRISM also
exhibits strong robustness against adaptive attacks, significantly increasing
computational costs for adversaries, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-distribution challenges, reducing attack success rates to just 8.70% on
the challenging multi-image MIS benchmark. Remarkably, this robust defense is
achieved while preserving, and in some cases enhancing, model utility. To
promote reproducibility, we have made our code, data, and model weights
available at https://github.com/SaFoLab-WISC/PRISM.

Motivation: 当前基准测试很少评估代码代理在真实的大规模代码仓库（如GitHub）工作流场景中的能力，而这是实际软件开发中的关键需求。为了填补这一空白，需要建立一个系统性的评估框架。

Method: 开发了GitTaskBench基准测试，包含54个现实任务，覆盖7个模态和7个领域。每个任务都配有相关的代码仓库和自动化评估工具链。提出了alpha-value指标来量化代理性能的经济效益，综合考虑任务成功率、token成本和开发者平均薪资。

Result: 在三个最先进的代理框架和多个先进LLM上的实验表明：即使性能最好的系统（OpenHands+Claude 3.7）也只能解决48.15%的任务。超过一半的失败归因于环境设置和依赖解析等看似简单但关键的步骤。

Conclusion: 利用代码仓库解决复杂任务仍然具有挑战性，需要更强大的工作流管理和超时准备。GitTaskBench的发布旨在推动仓库感知的代码推理、执行和部署方面的进展，使代理更接近解决复杂的端到端现实世界任务。

Abstract: Beyond scratch coding, exploiting large-scale code repositories (e.g.,
GitHub) for practical tasks is vital in real-world software development, yet
current benchmarks rarely evaluate code agents in such authentic,
workflow-driven scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce GitTaskBench, a
benchmark designed to systematically assess this capability via 54 realistic
tasks across 7 modalities and 7 domains. Each task pairs a relevant repository
with an automated, human-curated evaluation harness specifying practical
success criteria. Beyond measuring execution and task success, we also propose
the alpha-value metric to quantify the economic benefit of agent performance,
which integrates task success rates, token cost, and average developer
salaries. Experiments across three state-of-the-art agent frameworks with
multiple advanced LLMs show that leveraging code repositories for complex task
solving remains challenging: even the best-performing system, OpenHands+Claude
3.7, solves only 48.15% of tasks. Error analysis attributes over half of
failures to seemingly mundane yet critical steps like environment setup and
dependency resolution, highlighting the need for more robust workflow
management and increased timeout preparedness. By releasing GitTaskBench, we
aim to drive progress and attention toward repository-aware code reasoning,
execution, and deployment -- moving agents closer to solving complex,
end-to-end real-world tasks. The benchmark and code are open-sourced at

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM生成的程序提供正确性保证，显著提升了LLM驱动的机器人应用效果。

Abstract: The Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being deployed in robotics
to generate robot control programs for specific user tasks, enabling embodied
intelligence. Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt
design that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user
tasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and
the high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to
tremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly
undermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied.
This paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i)
provides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii)
enhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based
fine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is
proposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs,
bridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the
RSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by
the LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until
being verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the
LLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution,
significantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications.
Experiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range
of LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs.

Result: 在不同设置下，告知LLMs正在与自身互动显著改变了它们的合作倾向。这种"无意识歧视"可能无法解释地增加或减少多智能体环境中的合作

Conclusion: 尽管在简化环境中进行，但研究结果为理解多智能体系统中合作行为的微妙机制提供了重要见解，特别是在智能体可能无意识地区分交互对象的情况下

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

Conclusion: 该方法成功展示了LM在规划任务中的潜力，但发现LM可能不是基于语义推理，而是基于模式匹配，这对LM推理机制的理解提出了挑战

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

Conclusion: SchemaCoder是第一个完全自动化的模式提取框架，无需人工定制即可处理广泛的日志文件格式，通过创新的Q-Tree增强机制实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

Conclusion: PAF-KIP有效解决了开放集测试时适应中的错误累积问题，提升了模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code

Conclusion: LLMs的概率性质与法律解释的严谨、选择驱动需求之间存在差距，虽然增强技术有所帮助，但AI在法律领域的应用仍面临重大挑战，特别是在需要自由裁量权的任务中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

Method: 基于24名住院患者生活故事访谈的人类主题分析，使用三个LLM模仿原始研究者的解释风格，通过盲法和非盲法专家评估语义一致性、Jaccard系数和多维有效性评分。

Result: 模型与人类分析的重叠度从0%（GPT）到58%（Gemini）不等，Jaccard系数较低（0.21-0.28）。但模型发现了人类遗漏的主题，Gemini的输出最接近人类分析，有效性评分显著更高，且被盲法专家判断为人类分析。

Conclusion: AI增强的主题分析具有可变性和潜力，能够减轻人类解释偏见，特别是在文本量和每主题词汇量方面表现出强相关性。

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supporting clinical decisions. However,
deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We
propose Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric
quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence

stepwise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on
MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under
strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p
at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results
highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare
AI agents. Our work contributes to developing trustworthy clinical agents that

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的漏洞数据库(如NVD)缺乏关于漏洞实际影响的信息，特别是攻击者可能使用的战术、技术和程序(TTPs)。手动映射CVEs到TTPs耗时且困难，需要自动化支持。

Method: 提出TRIAGE双管齐下方法：1)基于MITRE CVE映射方法论的指令提示LLM预测初始技术列表；2)使用上下文学习的LLM模块映射CVEs到相关技术；3)将两种方法结果结合形成混合方法。

Result: 上下文学习方法优于单个映射方法，混合方法提高了利用技术的召回率。GPT-4o-mini在此任务上表现优于Llama3.3-70B。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于自动预测网络安全漏洞的影响，TRIAGE使CVEs到ATT&CK的映射过程更加高效。

Abstract: Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD),
offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but
often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the
vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a
challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities
published annually makes automated support desirable.
  This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses
Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK
knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE
Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then
combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context
learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach
strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our
evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping
methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We
also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task.
Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the
impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping
CVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.

Motivation: 当前代理工作流程服务效率低下，工作流组件分散在不同实体中，无法在准确性、延迟、能耗和成本之间进行权衡优化，导致资源浪费和服务水平目标下降。

Method: 引入声明式抽象分离工作流规范和执行配置，采用配置文件引导的优化器和自适应运行时来管理整个堆栈，包括编排工作流组件、映射到模型和硬件，以及动态重新配置执行以满足用户定义的SLO。

Result: 评估显示，Murakkab将GPU使用减少最多2.8倍，能耗减少3.7倍，成本减少4.3倍，同时保持SLO。

Conclusion: 通过暴露代理工作流程的内部结构，Murakkab实现了现有框架和云调度器无法达到的跨层优化，显著提高了资源效率。

Abstract: Agentic workflows commonly coordinate multiple models and tools with complex
control logic. They are quickly becoming the dominant paradigm for AI
applications. However, serving them remains inefficient with today's
frameworks. The key problem is that they expose workflows as opaque sequences
of model and tool calls that tightly couple agent logic with model and hardware
choices. Often, these workflow components are fragmented across different
entities, preventing systems from reasoning about trade-offs across accuracy,
latency, energy, and cost. This leads to resource waste and degraded
service-level objectives (SLOs).
  We present Murakkab, a resource-efficient serving system for agentic
workflows. Murakkab introduces a declarative abstraction that decouples
workflow specification from execution configuration. A profile-guided optimizer
and adaptive runtime jointly manage the full stack: orchestrating workflow
components, mapping them to models and hardware, and dynamically reconfiguring
execution to satisfy user-defined SLOs. By exposing the internal structure of
agentic workflows, Murakkab enables cross-layer optimization that existing
frameworks and cloud schedulers cannot achieve.
  Our evaluation on diverse workflows shows that \sysname{} reduces GPU usage
by up to 2.8$\times$, energy consumption by 3.7$\times$, and cost by
4.3$\times$ while maintaining SLOs.

Motivation: 传统基于签名的IDS需要频繁更新规则来应对不断演变的网络威胁，但规则更新过程耗时且延迟部署，影响安全准备状态。LLM驱动的智能系统为自主生成IDS规则提供了新的可能性。

Method: 提出FALCON框架，使用LLM驱动的自主代理从CTI数据实时生成IDS规则，包含内置的多阶段验证器，支持网络(Snort)和主机(YARA)两种检测媒介。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的数据挖掘在实时网络威胁缓解方面具有可行性和有效性，FALCON框架展示了自主IDS规则生成的潜力。

Abstract: Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect malicious activities
by matching network or host activity against predefined rules. These rules are
derived from extensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack
signatures and behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and manual
threat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then transformed into
actionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling real-time detection and
prevention. However, the constant evolution of cyber threats necessitates
frequent rule updates, which delay deployment time and weaken overall security
readiness. Recent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS rule generation with
internal evaluation. We introduce FALCON, an autonomous agentic framework that
generates deployable IDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them
using built-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we target
both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums and construct a
comprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their corresponding CTIs. Our
evaluations indicate FALCON excels in automatic rule generation, with an
average of 95% accuracy validated by qualitative evaluation with 84%
inter-rater agreement among multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics.
These results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-driven data
mining for real-time cyber threat mitigation.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了比传统SQL更灵活和可扩展的数据分析能力，成功克服了SQL的固有限制和LLM上下文长度限制

Abstract: Efficient querying and analysis of large tabular datasets remain significant
challenges, especially for users without expertise in programming languages
like SQL. Text-to-SQL approaches have shown promising performance on benchmark
data; however, they inherit SQL's drawbacks, including inefficiency with large
datasets and limited support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying.
We propose a novel framework that transforms natural language queries into
query plans. Our solution is implemented outside traditional databases,
allowing us to support classical SQL commands while avoiding SQL's inherent
limitations. Additionally, we enable complex analytical functions, such as
principal component analysis and anomaly detection, providing greater
flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities. We leverage
LLMs to iteratively interpret queries and construct operation sequences,
addressing computational complexity by incrementally building solutions. By
executing operations directly on the data, we overcome context length
limitations without requiring the entire dataset to be processed by the model.
We validate our framework through experiments on both standard databases and
large scientific tables, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling extensive
datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.

Conclusion: 模型校准需要结合行为经济学理论才能有效提升人类决策与预测的一致性，但信任感知需要更复杂的测量方法

Abstract: Calibration has been proposed as a way to enhance the reliability and
adoption of machine learning classifiers. We study a particular aspect of this
proposal: how does calibrating a classification model affect the decisions made
by non-expert humans consuming the model's predictions? We perform a
Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) experiment to ascertain the effect of
calibration on (i) trust in the model, and (ii) the correlation between
decisions and predictions. We also propose further corrections to the reported
calibrated scores based on Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory from
behavioral economics, and study the effect of these corrections on trust and
decision-making. We find that calibration is not sufficient on its own; the
prospect theory correction is crucial for increasing the correlation between
human decisions and the model's predictions. While this increased correlation
suggests higher trust in the model, responses to ``Do you trust the model
more?" are unaffected by the method used.

Abstract: Generative models have advanced rapidly, enabling impressive talking head

on one-way portrait animation. Even the few that support bidirectional
conversational interactions lack precise emotion-adaptive capabilities,
significantly limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose
EAI-Avatar, a novel emotion-aware talking head generation framework for dyadic
interactions. Leveraging the dialogue generation capability of large language
models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4), our method produces temporally consistent virtual
avatars with rich emotional variations that seamlessly transition between
speaking and listening states. Specifically, we design a Transformer-based head
mask generator that learns temporally consistent motion features in a latent
mask space, capable of generating arbitrary-length, temporally consistent mask
sequences to constrain head motions. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive
talking tree structure to represent dialogue state transitions, where each tree
node contains information such as child/parent/sibling nodes and the current
character's emotional state. By performing reverse-level traversal, we extract
rich historical emotional cues from the current node to guide expression
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and
effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: One of the enduring challenges in education is how to empower students to
take ownership of their learning by setting meaningful goals, tracking their
progress, and adapting their strategies when faced with setbacks. Research has
shown that this form of leaner-centered learning is best cultivated through
structured, supportive environments that promote guided practice, scaffolded
inquiry, and collaborative dialogue. In response, educational efforts have
increasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning
environments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems,
meanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is
delivered in digital learning environments. LLMs are enabling socially
interactive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support
that can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. In
parallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents
that are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these
remarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed
to resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct
pedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides
authoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer'
agent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has
explored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying
them through a central educational ontology. Through case studies in both
college-level and middle school settings, we demonstrate the framework's
adaptability across domains. We conclude by outlining key insights and future
directions for advancing AI-driven learning environments.

Abstract: The user experience with large-scale generative AI is paradoxical: superhuman
fluency meets absurd failures in common sense and consistency. This paper
argues that the resulting potent frustration is an ontological problem,
stemming from the "Quasi-Creature"-an entity simulating intelligence without
embodiment or genuine understanding. Interaction with this entity precipitates
the "Uncanny Valley of Agency," a framework where user comfort drops when
highly agentic AI proves erratically unreliable. Its failures are perceived as
cognitive breaches, causing profound cognitive dissonance. Synthesizing HCI,
cognitive science, and philosophy of technology, this paper defines the
Quasi-Creature and details the Uncanny Valley of Agency. An illustrative
mixed-methods study ("Move 78," N=37) of a collaborative creative task reveals
a powerful negative correlation between perceived AI efficiency and user
frustration, central to the negative experience. This framework robustly
explains user frustration with generative AI and has significant implications
for the design, ethics, and societal integration of these powerful, alien
technologies.

three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical
way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static
indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability
metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic,
scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific
evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.
Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective. Its
automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's
rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in
travel planning). By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of
candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%. User studies further confirm that LaQual
significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison
efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived
value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25). Overall, these results
demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered
solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use
cases.

TL;DR: FairSkillMARL框架将公平性定义为工作量平衡和技能任务对齐的双重目标，并提出了MARLHospital医疗环境来研究异构多智能体系统中的公平性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL公平性研究主要关注工作量平衡，忽视了智能体专业知识和现实世界中的结构化协调需求，特别是在医疗领域需要防止过度使用高技能人员和任务技能不匹配问题

Method: 提出FairSkillMARL框架，定义工作量平衡和技能任务对齐的双重公平目标；开发MARLHospital可定制医疗环境模拟器；与四种标准MARL方法和两种最先进公平指标进行比较实验

Result: 结果表明仅基于相等工作量的公平性可能导致任务技能不匹配，需要更鲁棒的指标来捕捉技能任务不对齐问题

Conclusion: 该研究为研究异构多智能体系统中公平性提供了工具和基础，特别是在需要将努力与专业知识对齐的关键领域

Abstract: Fairness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often framed as a
workload balance problem, overlooking agent expertise and the structured
coordination required in real-world domains. In healthcare, equitable task
allocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout
and overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing
an approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare
workers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address
this problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines
fairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment.
Second, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired
environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling
impacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this
problem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with
four standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics.
Our results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to
task-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that
capture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for
studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort
with expertise is critical.

Method: 将压缩策略建模为检索精度和存储效率之间的零和博弈，推导出保持语义相似性同时减少冗余的潜在变换

Result: 相比FAISS，平均相似度(0.9981 vs 0.5517)和效用(0.8873 vs 0.5194)显著提升，查询时间略有增加

Conclusion: 博弈论潜在压缩在高效用、基于transformer的搜索应用中具有实用价值，可无缝集成到现有LLM管道中

Abstract: Vector similarity search plays a pivotal role in modern information retrieval
systems, especially when powered by transformer-based embeddings. However, the
scalability and efficiency of such systems are often hindered by the high
dimensionality of latent representations. In this paper, we propose a novel
game-theoretic framework for optimizing latent-space compression to enhance
both the efficiency and semantic utility of vector search. By modeling the
compression strategy as a zero-sum game between retrieval accuracy and storage
efficiency, we derive a latent transformation that preserves semantic
similarity while reducing redundancy. We benchmark our method against FAISS, a
widely-used vector search library, and demonstrate that our approach achieves a
significantly higher average similarity (0.9981 vs. 0.5517) and utility (0.8873
vs. 0.5194), albeit with a modest increase in query time. This trade-off
highlights the practical value of game-theoretic latent compression in
high-utility, transformer-based search applications. The proposed system can be
seamlessly integrated into existing LLM pipelines to yield more semantically
accurate and computationally efficient retrieval.

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring
linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of
variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and
scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted
on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model
achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its
robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and
assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

Conclusion: TAFA框架通过特征模板有效解决了主动特征获取中的动作空间复杂性和数据分布依赖问题，实现了更好的性能和效率

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which,
at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

Result: 实验发现存在一组跨规划领域的最优WLF超参数配置，最佳超参数能够最小化执行时间。统计分析显示训练指标与规划指标之间无显著相关性。

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI

Conclusion: 智能非均匀采样是构建安全可靠自动驾驶代理的关键组件，为离线RL数据筛选提供了全面框架。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for
training autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world
driving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane
scenarios vastly outnumber rare "long-tail" events, leads to brittle and unsafe
policies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address
this challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data
curation strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich
samples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are
categorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and
behavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual
timestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based
architecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our
results demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the
baseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal
achieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate
by nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear
trade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while
scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a
comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that
intelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and
reliable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Vectorized quantum block encoding provides a way to embed classical data into
Hilbert space, offering a pathway for quantum models, such as Quantum
Transformers (QT), that replace classical self-attention with quantum circuit
simulations to operate more efficiently. Current QTs rely on deep parameterized
quantum circuits (PQCs), rendering them vulnerable to QPU noise, and thus
hindering their practical performance. In this paper, we propose the Vectorized
Quantum Transformer (VQT), a model that supports ideal masked attention matrix
computation through quantum approximation simulation and efficient training via
vectorized nonlinear quantum encoder, yielding shot-efficient and gradient-free
quantum circuit simulation (QCS) and reduced classical sampling overhead. In
addition, we demonstrate an accuracy comparison for IBM and IonQ in quantum
circuit simulation and competitive results in benchmarking natural language
processing tasks on IBM state-of-the-art and high-fidelity Kingston QPU. Our

Abstract: Objective: This work describes the topic modelling of Security Operations
Centre (SOC) use of a large language model (LLM), during live security
operations. The goal is to better understand how these specialists voluntarily
use this tool.
  Background: Human-automation teams have been extensively studied, but
transformer-based language models have sparked a new wave of collaboration. SOC
personnel at a major cybersecurity provider used an LLM to support live
security operations. This study examines how these specialists incorporated the
LLM into their work.
  Method: Our data set is the result of 10 months of SOC operators accessing
GPT-4 over an internally deployed HTTP-based chat application. We performed two
topic modelling exercises, first using the established BERTopic model
(Grootendorst, 2022), and second, using a novel topic modeling workflow.
  Results: Both the BERTopic analysis and novel modelling approach revealed
that SOC operators primarily used the LLM to facilitate their understanding of
complex text strings. Variations on this use-case accounted for ~40% of SOC LLM
usage.
  Conclusion: SOC operators are required to rapidly interpret complex commands

this activity indicates that their workflow can be supported and augmented by
designing collaborative LLM tools for use in the SOC.
  Application: This work can aid in creating next-generation tools for Security

TL;DR: 多说话人微调策略在构音障碍语音识别中表现优于单说话人微调，通过更广泛的病理特征学习提升泛化能力，降低WER达13.15%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决构音障碍语音识别中严重程度变化和与正常语音差异带来的挑战，传统方法对每个患者单独微调ASR模型存在效率低下问题

Method: 采用多说话人微调策略，同时在多个构音障碍说话人数据上进行微调，而非传统的单说话人单独微调

Result: 多说话人微调相比单说话人微调可降低WER达13.15%，提升目标说话人准确率，减少对每个患者数据的依赖，缓解说话人特定过拟合

Conclusion: 多说话人微调策略通过更广泛的病理特征学习有效提升构音障碍语音识别性能，具有更好的泛化能力和实用性

Abstract: Dysarthric speech recognition faces challenges from severity variations and
disparities relative to normal speech. Conventional approaches individually
fine-tune ASR models pre-trained on normal speech per patient to prevent
feature conflicts. Counter-intuitively, experiments reveal that multi-speaker
fine-tuning (simultaneously on multiple dysarthric speakers) improves
recognition of individual speech patterns. This strategy enhances
generalization via broader pathological feature learning, mitigates
speaker-specific overfitting, reduces per-patient data dependence, and improves
target-speaker accuracy - achieving up to 13.15% lower WER versus
single-speaker fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models have become widely adopted tools due to their versatile
capabilities, yet their user interfaces remain limited, often following rigid,
linear interaction paradigms. In this paper, we present insights from a design
thinking workshop held at the deRSE25 conference aiming at collaboratively
developing innovative user interface concepts for LLMs. During the workshop,
participants identified common use cases, evaluated the strengths and
shortcomings of current LLM interfaces, and created visualizations of new
interaction concepts emphasizing flexible context management, dynamic
conversation branching, and enhanced mechanisms for user control. We describe
how these participant-generated ideas advanced our own whiteboard-based UI
approach. The ongoing development of this interface is guided by the
human-centered design process - an iterative, user-focused methodology that
emphasizes continuous refinement through user feedback. Broader implications
for future LLM interface development are discussed, advocating for increased
attention to UI innovation grounded in user-centered design principles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音匿名化旨在隐藏说话人身份但保留语音效用，然而残留的说话人线索仍然存在隐私风险，需要开发攻击者侧的方法来增强自动说话人验证系统的去匿名化能力

Method: 提出SegReConcat数据增强方法：在单词级别分割匿名化语音，使用随机或基于相似性的策略重新排列片段以破坏长期上下文线索，然后将片段与原始话语拼接，使攻击者能从多个角度学习源说话人特征

Result: 在VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge 2024框架下评估了7个匿名化系统，SegReConcat在5个系统中提高了去匿名化性能

Conclusion: SegReConcat是一种有效的攻击者侧数据增强方法，能够通过破坏语音中的长期上下文线索来增强说话人验证系统的攻击能力，对大多数匿名化系统都有效

Abstract: Anonymization of voice seeks to conceal the identity of the speaker while
maintaining the utility of speech data. However, residual speaker cues often
persist, which pose privacy risks. We propose SegReConcat, a data augmentation
method for attacker-side enhancement of automatic speaker verification systems.
SegReConcat segments anonymized speech at the word level, rearranges segments
using random or similarity-based strategies to disrupt long-term contextual
cues, and concatenates them with the original utterance, allowing an attacker
to learn source speaker traits from multiple perspectives. The proposed method
has been evaluated in the VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge 2024 framework across
seven anonymization systems, SegReConcat improves de-anonymization on five out
of seven systems.

Result: 论文提出了一个统一的、自适应的防御系统框架，能够动态适应不断变化的APT攻击策略

Conclusion: 该框架为APT检测提供了新的解决方案，通过结合多种机器学习技术实现了对隐蔽和自适应攻击的有效检测

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a growing menace to modern
digital infrastructure. Unlike traditional cyberattacks, APTs are stealthy,
adaptive, and long-lasting, often bypassing signature-based detection systems.
This paper introduces a novel framework for APT detection that unites deep
learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and active learning into a cohesive,
adaptive defense system. Our system combines auto-encoders for latent
behavioral encoding with a multi-agent ensemble of RL-based defenders, each
trained to distinguish between benign and malicious process behaviors. We
identify a critical challenge in existing detection systems: their static
nature and inability to adapt to evolving attack strategies. To this end, our
architecture includes multiple RL agents (Q-Learning, PPO, DQN, adversarial
defenders), each analyzing latent vectors generated by an auto-encoder. When
any agent is uncertain about its decision, the system triggers an active
learning loop to simulate expert feedback, thus refining decision boundaries.
An ensemble voting mechanism, weighted by each agent's performance, ensures
robust final predictions.

Abstract: Autonomous skill discovery aims to enable robots to acquire diverse behaviors
without explicit supervision. Learning such behaviors directly on physical
hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints.
Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require
manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting
real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition
(URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and
master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We
demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a
Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach
supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings.
We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream
tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all
baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios.
Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that
enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention,
representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic
systems. Demonstration videos are available at

Method: 提出SecureV2X系统，在服务器和车辆之间部署安全神经网络推理，支持多智能体协作，研究两个应用：安全疲劳检测和安全闯红灯检测

Result: 系统性能显著优于基线，在疲劳检测中速度快9.4倍，计算轮次减少143倍，通信量减少16.6倍；在闯红灯检测中运行速度比最先进基准快近100倍

Conclusion: SecureV2X为车联网系统提供了一个高效、可扩展的安全计算解决方案，能够在保护隐私的同时支持大规模安全计算交互

Abstract: Autonomous driving and V2X technologies have developed rapidly in the past
decade, leading to improved safety and efficiency in modern transportation.
These systems interact with extensive networks of vehicles, roadside
infrastructure, and cloud resources to support their machine learning
capabilities. However, the widespread use of machine learning in V2X systems
raises issues over the privacy of the data involved. This is particularly
concerning for smart-transit and driver safety applications which can
implicitly reveal user locations or explicitly disclose medical data such as
EEG signals. To resolve these issues, we propose SecureV2X, a scalable,
multi-agent system for secure neural network inferences deployed between the
server and each vehicle. Under this setting, we study two multi-agent V2X
applications: secure drowsiness detection, and secure red-light violation
detection. Our system achieves strong performance relative to baselines, and
scales efficiently to support a large number of secure computation interactions
simultaneously. For instance, SecureV2X is $9.4 \times$ faster, requires
$143\times$ fewer computational rounds, and involves $16.6\times$ less
communication on drowsiness detection compared to other secure systems.
Moreover, it achieves a runtime nearly $100\times$ faster than state-of-the-art
benchmarks in object detection tasks for red light violation detection.

Conclusion: INSIDE是一种灵活、可扩展的数据扩展方法，可与其他增强技术兼容，有效提升说话人验证性能

Abstract: The success of deep learning-based speaker verification systems is largely
attributed to access to large-scale and diverse speaker identity data. However,
collecting data from more identities is expensive, challenging, and often
limited by privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we propose INSIDE
(Interpolating Speaker Identities in Embedding Space), a novel data expansion
method that synthesizes new speaker identities by interpolating between
existing speaker embeddings. Specifically, we select pairs of nearby speaker
embeddings from a pretrained speaker embedding space and compute intermediate
embeddings using spherical linear interpolation. These interpolated embeddings
are then fed to a text-to-speech system to generate corresponding speech
waveforms. The resulting data is combined with the original dataset to train
downstream models. Experiments show that models trained with INSIDE-expanded
data outperform those trained only on real data, achieving 3.06\% to 5.24\%
relative improvements. While INSIDE is primarily designed for speaker
verification, we also validate its effectiveness on gender classification,
where it yields a 13.44\% relative improvement. Moreover, INSIDE is compatible
with other augmentation techniques and can serve as a flexible, scalable
addition to existing training pipelines.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

Abstract: Hotword customization is crucial in ASR to enhance the accuracy of
domain-specific terms. It has been primarily driven by the advancements in
traditional models and Audio large language models (LLMs). However, existing
models often struggle with large-scale hotwords, as the recognition rate drops
dramatically with the number of hotwords increasing. In this paper, we
introduce a novel hotword customization system that utilizes a hotword
pre-retrieval module (H-PRM) to identify the most relevant hotword candidate by
measuring the acoustic similarity between the hotwords and the speech segment.
This plug-and-play solution can be easily integrated into traditional models
such as SeACo-Paraformer, significantly enhancing hotwords post-recall rate
(PRR). Additionally, we incorporate H-PRM into Audio LLMs through a
prompt-based approach, enabling seamless customization of hotwords. Extensive
testing validates that H-PRM can outperform existing methods, showing a new
direction for hotword customization in ASR.

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,

via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub

behaviors.

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and

underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial

introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently
exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes
crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating
disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors
and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning
intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

Motivation: 现有的sRGB域扩散模型在处理有损sRGB输入时面临高保真度和真实生成之间的困境，且忽略了传感器RAW图像在许多场景中的可访问性。

Method: 提出RAW域VAE学习最优潜在表示，可微分后色调处理模块实现RAW和sRGB空间联合优化，开发可扩展退化管道合成RAW LQ-HQ对，设计可配置多拜耳LoRA模块处理不同RAW模式。

Result: 大量实验证明RDDM优于最先进的sRGB扩散方法，产生更高保真度结果且伪影更少。

Conclusion: RDDM通过直接在RAW域处理图像，为图像恢复提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time monophonic pitch estimation in noisy conditions,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains an open challenge in
audio processing. We present \emph{SwiftF0}, a novel, lightweight neural model
that sets a new state-of-the-art for monophonic pitch estimation. Through
training on diverse speech, music, and synthetic datasets with extensive data
augmentation, SwiftF0 achieves robust generalization across acoustic domains
while maintaining computational efficiency. SwiftF0 achieves a 91.80\% harmonic
mean (HM) at 10 dB SNR, outperforming baselines like CREPE by over 12
percentage points and degrading by only 2.3 points from clean audio. SwiftF0
requires only 95,842 parameters and runs approximately 42x faster than CREPE on
CPU, making it ideal for efficient, real-time deployment. To address the
critical lack of perfectly accurate ground truth pitch in speech corpora (which
typically rely on algorithmic estimators or laryngograph signals), we introduce
\emph{SpeechSynth}. This synthetic speech dataset, generated by a phoneme-level
TTS model, provides exact, on-demand ground-truth pitch curves, enabling more
robust model training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose a unified metric,
combining six complementary performance measures for comprehensive and reliable
pitch evaluation, and release an open-source pitch benchmark suite. A live demo

Abstract: We present a new application of model checking which achieves real-time
multi-step planning and obstacle avoidance on a real autonomous robot. We have
developed a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans
in situ based on "core" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents.
This is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered
device. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are
spawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an
autonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel
discretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local
environment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward
depth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both
empirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our
approach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient
multi-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of
a reactive agent which can only plan one step. Our approach is an instructional
case study for the development of safe, reliable and explainable planning in
the context of autonomous vehicles.

Conclusion: 该研究为分配平台提供了有效的促进机制，能够在预算约束下优化社会总效用，同时保护个体利益

Abstract: We consider a setting where goods are allocated to agents by way of an
allocation platform (e.g., a matching platform). An ``allocation facilitator''
aims to increase the overall utility/social-good of the allocation by
encouraging (some of the) agents to relax (some of) their restrictions. At the
same time, the advice must not hurt agents who would otherwise be better off.
Additionally, the facilitator may be constrained by a ``bound'' (a.k.a.
`budget'), limiting the number and/or type of restrictions it may seek to
relax. We consider the facilitator's optimization problem of choosing an
optimal set of restrictions to request to relax under the aforementioned
constraints. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We provide a formal
definition of the problem, including the participation guarantees to which the
facilitator should adhere. We define a hierarchy of participation guarantees
and also consider several social-good functions. (ii) We provide polynomial
algorithms for solving various versions of the associated optimization
problems, including one-to-one and many-to-one allocation settings. (iii) We
demonstrate the benefits of such facilitation and relaxation, and the
implications of the different participation guarantees, using extensive
experimentation on three real-world datasets.

Abstract: Single-cell multi-omics data contain huge information of cellular states, and
analyzing these data can reveal valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity,
diseases, and biological processes. However, as cell differentiation \&
development is a continuous and dynamic process, it remains challenging to
computationally model and infer cell interaction patterns based on single-cell
multi-omics data. This paper presents scI2CL, a new single-cell multi-omics
fusion framework based on intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning, to learn
comprehensive and discriminative cellular representations from complementary
multi-omics data for various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments of four
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of scI2CL and its superiority over
existing peers. Concretely, in cell clustering, scI2CL surpasses eight
state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used real-world datasets. In cell
subtyping, scI2CL effectively distinguishes three latent monocyte cell
subpopulations, which are not discovered by existing methods. Simultaneously,
scI2CL is the only method that correctly constructs the cell developmental
trajectory from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to Memory B cells. In
addition, scI2CL resolves the misclassification of cell types between two
subpopulations of CD4+ T cells, while existing methods fail to precisely
distinguish the mixed cells. In summary, scI2CL can accurately characterize
cross-omics relationships among cells, thus effectively fuses multi-omics data
and learns discriminative cellular representations to support various
downstream analysis tasks.

Conclusion: 知识建构是促进程序性和概念性知识双向发展的关键中介机制，教学代理的追问策略能有效激发学生的知识建构行为，提升学习效果。

Abstract: When adopting the role of a teacher in learning-by-teaching environments,
students often struggle to engage in knowledge-building activities, such as
providing explanations and addressing misconceptions. Instead, they frequently
default to knowledge-telling behaviors, where they simply dictate what they
already know or what to do without deeper reflection, thereby limiting
learning. Teachable agents, particularly those capable of posing persistent
follow-up questions, have been shown to encourage students (tutors) to shift
from knowledge-telling to knowledge-building and enhance tutor learning. Tutor
learning encompasses two interrelated types of knowledge: conceptual and
procedural knowledge. Research has established a bidirectional relationship
between these knowledge types, where improvements in one reinforce the other.
This study investigates the role of knowledge-building in mediating the
bidirectional relationship between procedural and conceptual learning. Our
findings revealed a stable bidirectional relationship between procedural and
conceptual knowledge, with higher post-test scores observed among students who
engaged in knowledge-building, regardless of their procedural and conceptual
pre-test performance. This suggests that knowledge-building serves as a crucial
mechanism bridging the gap between students with low prior knowledge and higher
conceptual and procedural learning gain.

Abstract: Existing datasets for precision agriculture have primarily been collected in
static or controlled environments such as indoor labs or greenhouses, often

Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as
base stations are extremely susceptible to security attacks due to their
distributed and dynamic nature, which makes them vulnerable to rogue nodes. In
this paper, a new Dynamic Trust Score Adjustment Mechanism with Energy-Aware
Consensus (DTSAM-EAC) is proposed to enhance security in UAV-based NTNs. The
proposed framework integrates a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with
Federated Learning (FL) to support privacy-preserving trust evaluation. Trust
ratings are updated continuously through weighted aggregation of past trust,
present behavior, and energy contribution, thus making the system adaptive to
changing network conditions. An energy-aware consensus mechanism prioritizes
UAVs with greater available energy for block validation, ensuring efficient use
of resources under resource-constrained environments. FL aggregation with
trust-weighting further increases the resilience of the global trust model.
Simulation results verify the designed framework achieves 94\% trust score
prediction accuracy and 96\% rogue UAV detection rate while outperforming
centralized and static baselines of trust-based solutions on privacy, energy
efficiency, and reliability. It complies with 6G requirements in terms of
distributed intelligence and sustainability and is an energy-efficient and

Abstract: Estimating emotional states from physiological signals is a central topic in
affective computing and psychophysiology. While many emotion estimation systems
implicitly assume a stable relationship between physiological features and
subjective affect, this assumption has rarely been tested over long timeframes.
This study investigates whether such relationships remain consistent across
several months within individuals. We developed a custom measurement system and
constructed a longitudinal dataset by collecting physiological signals --
including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature,
and acceleration--along with self-reported emotional states from 24
participants over two three-month periods. Data were collected in naturalistic
working environments, allowing analysis of the relationship between
physiological features and subjective arousal in everyday contexts. We examined
how physiological-arousal relationships evolve over time by using Explainable
Boosting Machines (EBMs) to ensure model interpretability. A model trained on
1st-period data showed a 5\% decrease in accuracy when tested on 2nd-period
data, indicating long-term variability in physiological-arousal associations.
EBM-based comparisons further revealed that while heart rate remained a
relatively stable predictor, minimum EDA exhibited substantial individual-level
fluctuations between periods. While the number of participants is limited,
these findings highlight the need to account for temporal variability in
physiological-arousal relationships and suggest that emotion estimation models
should be periodically updated -- e.g., every five months -- based on observed
shift trends to maintain robust performance over time.

Abstract: Yoga is a discipline of physical postures, breathing techniques, and
meditative practices rooted in ancient Indian traditions, now embraced
worldwide for promoting overall well-being and inner balance. The practices are
a large set of items, our term for executable actions like physical poses or
breath exercises, to offer for a person's well-being. However, to get benefits
of Yoga tailored to a person's unique needs, a person needs to (a) discover
their subset from the large and seemingly complex set with inter-dependencies,
(b) continue to follow them with interest adjusted to their changing abilities
and near-term objectives, and (c) as appropriate, adapt to alternative items
based on changing environment and the person's health conditions. In this
vision paper, we describe the challenges for the Yoga personalization problem.
Next, we sketch a preliminary approach and use the experience to provide an
outlook on solving the challenging problem using existing and novel techniques

### [241] [Reasoning Steps as Curriculum: Using Depth of Thought as a Difficulty Signal for Tuning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18279)
*Jeesu Jung,Sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于思维深度(DoT)的课程学习方法，通过统计教师模型推理步骤数量来定义难度，构建从浅到深的课程训练LLM


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种与推理能力对齐、可扩展且可解释的难度信号来指导LLM的课程学习

Method: 将难度定义为思维深度(DoT)，通过统计教师模型推理轨迹中的离散步骤数量来操作化，构建从浅到深的课程训练顺序

Result: 提出三个可验证假设：DoT与推理基准难度相关、DoT排序课程优于其他方法、难度在不同教师模型间具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法为推理中心训练提供了认知基础扎实、可解释的课程学习方法

Abstract: Curriculum learning for training LLMs requires a difficulty signal that
aligns with reasoning while remaining scalable and interpretable. We propose a
simple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should
also be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of
thought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher
model's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow
to deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and
schedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT
correlates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)
DoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under
matched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given
light formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss
threats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical
mitigations. Taken together, we aim to move toward cognitively grounded,
interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training.

Motivation: 随着预训练Transformer语言模型规模增大和部署广泛，其在输入扰动下的鲁棒性成为紧迫问题。现有方法在大模型和小模型之间存在差异，且通常依赖人工密集的样本特定对抗设计。

Method: 提出统一的局部鲁棒性框架SALMAN，使用新颖的Distance Mapping Distortion (DMD)度量，通过比较输入到输出的距离映射来评估样本敏感性，具有近线性复杂度。

Result: 在攻击效率和鲁棒训练方面取得了显著提升，证明了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: SALMAN框架是一个实用的、模型无关的工具，可用于提升基于Transformer的NLP系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled
state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow
in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an
increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between
small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on
labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose
a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates
model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex
perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping
Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing
input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By
demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we
position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the
reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中取得优异性能，计算复杂度更低，不出现长期衰减现象，且与线性注意力兼容。

Conclusion: CoPE提供了一种高效的位置编码解决方案，在保持性能的同时降低了计算成本，为Transformer架构优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of position encoding in
transformer architectures. By incorporating positional information, this
approach provides essential guidance for modeling dependencies between elements
across different sequence positions. We introduce CoPE (a lightweight Complex
Positional Encoding), a novel architecture that leverages complex-valued
encoding to encode both content and positional information. Our approach
replaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the
real part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional
information. We introduce phase-aware attention in the first layer of the
transformer model to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard
attention layers for higher-levels. We show that CoPE doesn't exhibit long term
decay and is compatible with linear attention. Experimental evaluation on the
GLUE benchmark suggest that our approach achieves superior performance with
less computational complexity, compared to RoPE, Sinusoidal and Learned

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences,
bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a
fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are
most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study
of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a
dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected
responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how
contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen
samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces
to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across
diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses
consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected
responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our
results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer
practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM
alignment.

Result: 在三个主流MoE模型上，约25%的丢弃率仅导致平均精度下降0.08%-0.28%，计算丢弃程度与计算加速成正比；负载均衡感知的专家并行实现了1.41倍MoE模块加速，仅0.5%平均精度损失

Conclusion: 该方法通过后处理方式有效提升了MoE模型的推理效率，在保持数学一致性的同时实现了显著的性能提升，为大语言模型的高效部署提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a mainstream architecture for building
Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing per-token computation while enabling
model scaling. It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network
(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and
activating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves
efficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive
computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.
  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor
and neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy
and efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through
finer-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training
expert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves
the mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both
efficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon
this, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic
tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to
deliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.
  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with
our approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three
prevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping
consistently yield proportional computational speedups. Furthermore,
incorporating load-imbalance awareness into expert parallelism achieves a 1.41x
MoE module speedup with just 0.5% average accuracy degradation.

Result: 在真实生产环境中验证，支持从几十到数千GPU的扩展，相比现有方法实现2.6倍性能提升，且不损失精度

Conclusion: 利用历史相似性可以有效解决RL训练中的效率问题，为大规模LLM RL训练提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL
encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates
collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue
to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:
(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time
scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in
GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation
offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.
  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout
responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based
on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate
RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we
present HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the
similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.
Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier
scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout
distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated
RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from
dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL
achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without
compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.

Conclusion: FFT MoE通过MoE适配器和异构感知路由机制，有效解决了联邦微调中的异构性问题，为资源受限环境下的模型适应提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: As FMs drive progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
fine-tuning them under privacy and resource constraints has become increasingly
critical particularly when highquality training data resides on distributed
edge devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through
Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation
without sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce
computational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in
heterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with
varying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data
distributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these
challenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with
sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight
gating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts,
enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving
aggregation compatibility. To further combat the expert load imbalance caused
by device and data heterogeneity, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary
loss that dynamically regularizes the routing distribution to ensure expert
diversity and balanced utilization. Extensive experiments spanning both IID and
non-IID conditions demonstrate that FFT MoE consistently outperforms state of
the art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models
(LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data
pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in
state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current
dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two
distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of
MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,
and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we
record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us
to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.
Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring
training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even
regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.
Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,
and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate
the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training
reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning
deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are
open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

Conclusion: 内存层架构已达到与最先进MoE模型性能相当的水平，为高效稀疏计算提供了有吸引力的替代方案。

Abstract: While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by
activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access
costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing
alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem
have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly
short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a
redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our
approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every
transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections,
adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled
parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.
Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves
performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and
parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows
superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6
points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization,
and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with
models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and
establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total
sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to
performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting a compelling

Abstract: Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning
environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs).
Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture
an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO
aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often
limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated
Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to
combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its
logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a
Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights
proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add
entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature
collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous
(reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly,
aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior
better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO
provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging
full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.

Abstract: Despite the advantageous subquadratic complexity of modern recurrent deep
learning models -- such as state-space models (SSMs) -- recent studies have
highlighted their potential shortcomings compared to transformers on reasoning
and memorization tasks. In this paper, we dive deeper into one of such
benchmarks: associative recall (AR), which has been shown to correlate well
with language modeling performance, and inspect in detail the effects of
scaling and optimization issues in recently proposed token mixing strategies.
We first demonstrate that, unlike standard transformers, the choice of learning
rate plays a critical role in the performance of modern recurrent models: an
issue that can severely affect reported performance in previous works and
suggests further research is needed to stabilize training. Next, we show that
recurrent and attention-based models exhibit contrasting benefits when scaling
in width as opposed to depth, with attention being notably unable to solve AR
when limited to a single layer. We then further inspect 1-layer transformers,
revealing that despite their poor performance, their training dynamics
surprisingly resemble the formation of induction heads, a phenomenon previously
observed only in their 2-layer counterparts. Finally, through architectural
ablations, we study how components affects Transformer and Mamba's performance
and optimization stability.

Conclusion: APT-LLM有效解决了超低位宽量化LLM在GPU上的计算效率问题，为高效LLM部署提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time
performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however,
attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs
at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to
the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and
inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM.
Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for
efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more
conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication
(MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and
reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision
and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a
memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs
fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce
memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that
dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for
varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM
architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to
a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup
over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800,
APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup
over CUTLASS integer baselines.

Result: 在Taxi、Pacman、Frozen Lake等2D游戏和血糖控制任务中，对不确定轨迹进行反馈的智能体学习速度更快，在血糖控制任务中优于基线方法

Conclusion: 提出的结合概率众包建模和主动学习的框架能有效处理噪声人类反馈，提高基于偏好强化学习的效率和效果

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning has gained prominence as a strategy
for training agents in environments where the reward signal is difficult to
specify or misaligned with human intent. However, its effectiveness is often
limited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input,
especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To
address this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary
strategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator
feedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative
agent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers,
estimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query
selection to guide feedback requests. We evaluate our approach in a set of
environments that span both synthetic and real-world-inspired settings,
including 2D games (Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake) and a blood glucose control task
for Type 1 Diabetes using the clinically approved UVA/Padova simulator. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that agents trained with feedback on uncertain
trajectories exhibit faster learning in most tasks, and we outperform the
baselines for the blood glucose control task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然集成工具（如Python解释器）的大语言模型显示出巨大潜力，但缺乏解释这一范式为何有效的理论原理。

Method: 引入优势塑造策略优化(ASPO)算法直接修改优势函数来指导策略行为，在数学基准测试中使用Python解释器作为外部工具进行实验。

Result: TIR模型在pass@k指标上显著优于纯文本模型，优势不仅限于计算密集型问题，还扩展到需要抽象洞察力的问题。模型学会了更早调用代码和更多交互轮次的工具使用行为。

Conclusion: 这项工作为TIR的成功提供了首个原理性解释，将焦点从工具是否有效转向了工具为何以及如何实现更强大的推理能力。

Abstract: We study why Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) makes Large Language Models
(LLMs) more capable. While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code
interpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this
paradigm is effective has been missing. This work provides the first formal
proof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that
tools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support,
breaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking
problem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably
verbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and
performance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a
novel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the
policy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging
mathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.
Our results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text
counterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to
computationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant
abstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that
illustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved
tool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns
with ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for
TIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and
how they enable more powerful reasoning.

Motivation: MTP作为辅助目标在语言模型训练中表现不一致，在标准NLP基准测试中表现不佳。作者认为MTP的精确未来token预测作为辅助损失过于困难。

Method: 提出Token Order Prediction (TOP)，使用学习排序损失训练模型按接近度对即将到来的token进行排序。相比MTP需要多个transformer层，TOP仅需单个额外的unembedding层。在340M、1.8B和7B参数模型上进行了预训练实验。

Result: 在8个标准NLP基准测试中，TOP整体表现优于NTP和MTP，即使在较大规模模型上也是如此。

Conclusion: TOP是一种有效的替代MTP的辅助训练目标，能够提升语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has been proposed as an auxiliary objective to
improve next-token prediction (NTP) in language model training but shows
inconsistent improvements, underperforming in standard NLP benchmarks. We argue
that MTP's exact future token prediction is too difficult as an auxiliary loss.
Instead, we propose Token Order Prediction (TOP), which trains models to order
upcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. TOP requires
only a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple
transformer layers. We pretrain models of 340M, 1.8B, and 7B parameters using
NTP, MTP, and TOP objectives. Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show
that TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale. Our code is

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale requires meeting strict Service
Level Objectives (SLOs) under severe computational and memory constraints.
Nevertheless, traditional caching strategies fall short: exact-matching and
prefix caches neglect query semantics, while state-of-the-art semantic caches
remain confined to traditional intuitions, offering little conceptual
departure. Building on this, we present SISO, a semantic caching system that
redefines efficiency for LLM serving. SISO introduces centroid-based caching to
maximize coverage with minimal memory, locality-aware replacement to preserve
high-value entries, and dynamic thresholding to balance accuracy and latency
under varying workloads. Across diverse datasets, SISO delivers up to
1.71$\times$ higher hit ratios and consistently stronger SLO attainment

Method: 集成VSIMR(使用VAE奖励状态新颖性)和基于LLM预训练知识生成奖励信号的方法，在MiniGrid DoorKey环境中使用Actor-Critic(A2C)代理进行实现

Conclusion: VSIMR驱动新状态探索，LLM奖励促进目标导向的渐进利用，两种策略在环境和任务的不同方面有效互补

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to
improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments
with extreme sparse rewards, where traditional learning struggles due to
infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as
Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward
state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language
Models (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward
signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We
implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the
MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical
results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent
performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy
individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of
learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements
different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new
states, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation
towards goals.

Abstract: Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across
software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog
remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity,
and simulation complexity. In this work, we address these challenges by
introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code
generation. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated
from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity
labels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy
reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages
reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and
support reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting
and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting
strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability
distributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline
that co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such
as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and
DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method
demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset
combined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass
rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings
highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation

Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early
prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments.
While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise

impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model

optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval.
DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning

DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score

delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through
its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug

Conclusion: LRTab成功整合了微调和提示方法的优势，为表格推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Automated tabular understanding and reasoning are essential tasks for data
scientists. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly
prevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning
LLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using
chain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost
of generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does
not take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel
prompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which
integrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from
training data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training
data. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to
avoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness
of Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we
retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table
understanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact,
showing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform
previous baselines in tabular reasoning.

Conclusion: GaaS将治理定位为类似计算或存储的运行时服务，为可互操作的代理生态系统建立基础设施级别的对齐机制。

Abstract: As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution,
asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable,
decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are
reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them
non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven
enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering
model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules
and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and
severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive
interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.
  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models
(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial
decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,
GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All
actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that
GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving
throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing
untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.
  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,
GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent
ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,
we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior
performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is becoming central to modern distribution
systems as rooftop PV and home energy management systems become pervasive, yet
most existing market and reinforcement learning designs emphasize efficiency or
private profit and offer little real-time guidance to ensure equitable outcomes
under uncertainty. To address this gap, a fairness-aware multiagent
reinforcement learning framework, FairMarket-RL, is proposed in which a large
language model (LLM) critic shapes bidding policies within a continuous double
auction under partial observability and discrete price-quantity actions. After
each trading slot, the LLM returns normalized fairness scores Fairness-to-Grid
(FTG), Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS), and Fairness-of-Pricing (FPP) that are
integrated into the reward via ramped coefficients and tunable scaling, so that
fairness guidance complements, rather than overwhelms, economic incentives. The
environment models realistic residential load and PV profiles and enforce hard
constraints on prices, physical feasibility, and policy-update stability.
Across a progression of experiments from a small pilot to a larger simulated
community and a mixed-asset real-world dataset, the framework shifts exchanges
toward local P2P trades, lowers consumer costs relative to grid-only
procurement, sustains strong fairness across participants, and preserves
utility viability. Sensitivity analyses over solar availability and aggregate
demand further indicate robust performance, suggesting a scalable, LLM-guided
pathway to decentralized electricity markets that are economically efficient,
socially equitable, and technically sound.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) enables agents to learn
control policies without requiring manually designed reward functions, making
it well-suited for tasks where objectives are difficult to formalize or
inherently subjective. Acrobatic flight poses a particularly challenging
problem due to its complex dynamics, rapid movements, and the importance of
precise execution. In this work, we explore the use of PbRL for agile drone
control, focusing on the execution of dynamic maneuvers such as powerloops.
Building on Preference-based Proximal Policy Optimization (Preference PPO), we
propose Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC), an extension to the reward
learning objective that improves preference modeling and learning stability.
Our method achieves 88.4% of the shaped reward performance, compared to 55.2%
with standard Preference PPO. We train policies in simulation and successfully
transfer them to real-world drones, demonstrating multiple acrobatic maneuvers
where human preferences emphasize stylistic qualities of motion. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the applicability of our probabilistic reward model in a
representative MuJoCo environment for continuous control. Finally, we highlight
the limitations of manually designed rewards, observing only 60.7% agreement

Abstract: The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge
of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank
tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close
connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor
decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct
interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been
proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such
results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review,
we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal
processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in
theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs,
including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational
hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an
accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities,
ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way,
and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions
for the theory of deep NNs.

Motivation: 解决当代AI研究中的一个核心问题：量化神经网络在完美训练时能够执行何种形式的推理任务，通过将推理任务解释为电路模拟来回答这个问题。

Method: 提出一种元算法，通过迭代地将电路中的每个门替换为规范的ReLU多层感知机模拟器，将任意电路转换为前馈神经网络。

Result: 证明了在数字计算机上，该构造能够精确模拟电路（无近似、无舍入、包括模溢出），神经网络参数量与电路复杂度成比例，网络计算图反映被模拟电路的结构。

Conclusion: 神经网络可以通过牺牲算法运行时间（电路运行时间）来换取空间复杂度（神经元数量），该结果比经典通用近似定理更强大，任何通用函数逼近器都可以被编码为电路并由神经网络直接模拟。

Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of
reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper
answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the
gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic,
tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for
symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning;
e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit
into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively
replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any
digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no
approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no
reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons
in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's
complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of
the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade
algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of
neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating
shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped
Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation
of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is
strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any
universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly
emulated by a NN.

Conclusion: BTW框架有效解决了多模态学习中噪声模态的问题，提供了可扩展的实例级模态重要性控制

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become increasingly powerful in
multimodal learning by enabling modular specialization across modalities.
However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities
introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such
as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two
modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We
propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric
weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust
modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional
parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities.
Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence
between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide
MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal
outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical
classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression
performance and multiclass classification accuracy.

Conclusion: 深度强化学习可以有效促进恶意软件检测，并在动态的Android恶意软件环境中提高对概念漂移的弹性，这是首次证明DRL在该领域的有效性。

Abstract: Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats,
limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers,
without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept
drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot
optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern
malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning
(AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this
work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov
Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent,
simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting
high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and
drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent
through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic
drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under
these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to
standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved
resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved a
$5.18\pm5.44$, $14.49\pm12.86$, and $10.06\pm10.81$ average AUT performance
improvement for the classification only, classification with rejection, and
classification with rejection and AL settings, respectively. Our results
demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware
detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic environment
of the Android malware domain.

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and

approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

Motivation: 现代时间序列预测模型通常不透明且不提供预测解释，而现有的事后可解释性方法（如LIME）不适合预测场景，因此需要专门的时间序列预测解释方法。

Method: 基于局部输入扰动的模型无关事后解释算法，通过时间步相关性矩阵分析，能够生成多粒度解释并捕捉跨通道相关性。

Result: 在7种算法和10个数据集上的实验表明，PAX-TS能有效捕捉模型行为，识别出6类重复出现的模式，这些模式是性能指标，不同类别间预测误差存在显著差异。

Conclusion: PAX-TS能够以不同详细程度说明时间序列预测模型的机制，其解释可用于回答关于预测的实际问题，为模型可解释性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last
years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements
of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do
not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc
explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.
We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series
forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input
perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able
to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series
forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,
demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,
compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present
the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations
of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,
highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's
behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,
we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different
datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of
performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the
classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates
how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With
PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in
different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer
practical questions on forecasts.

Conclusion: 为联邦学习中的数据遗忘提供了实用解决方案，具有模型无关性，支持类别和客户端遗忘，无需服务器访问原始客户端数据

Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models.
This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where
data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often
infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework
based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation
problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and
selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being
forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic
approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server
access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on
benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random,
categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against
re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency
over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario,
our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model
integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.

Conclusion: DAM模型通过统计力学分析和正则化改进，在保持与前沿机器学习范式关联的同时，实现了更稳定的训练和更高的计算效率。

Abstract: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention
since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related
to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention
mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM
built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which
represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis,
we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points
of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic
data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a
novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable.
Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to
both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our
theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively
small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a
network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to
drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.

Conclusion: DenseRec为冷启动序列推荐提供了一个实用且鲁棒的解决方案，通过简单的线性投影方法有效解决了内容嵌入集成问题

Abstract: Transformer-based sequential recommenders, such as SASRec or BERT4Rec,
typically rely solely on learned item ID embeddings, making them vulnerable to
the item cold-start problem, particularly in environments with dynamic item
catalogs. While dense content embeddings from pre-trained models offer
potential solutions, direct integration into transformer-based recommenders has
consistently underperformed compared to ID-only approaches. We revisit this
integration challenge and propose DenseRec, a simple yet effective method that
introduces a dual-path embedding approach. DenseRec learns a linear projection
from the dense embedding space into the ID embedding space during training,
enabling seamless generalization to previously unseen items without requiring
specialized embedding models or complex infrastructure. In experiments on three
real-world datasets, we find DenseRec to consistently outperform an ID-only
SASRec baseline, even without additional hyperparameter tuning and while using
compact embedding models. Our analysis suggests improvements primarily arise
from better sequence representations in the presence of unseen items,
positioning DenseRec as a practical and robust solution for cold-start
sequential recommendation.

Abstract: Studies conducted on enterprise-scale infrastructure have shown that GPUs --
the core computational resource for deep learning (DL) training -- are often
significantly underutilized. DL task collocation on GPUs is an opportunity to
address this challenge. However, it may result in (1) out-of-memory crashes for
the subsequently arriving task and (2) slowdowns for all tasks sharing the GPU

robustness, while the latter affects the quality of service and energy
efficiency.
  We propose CARMA, a server-scale task-level collocation-aware resource
management system that handles both collocation challenges. CARMA encompasses
GPUMemNet, a novel ML-based GPU memory estimator framework for DL training
tasks, to minimize out-of-memory errors and introduces collocation policies
that cap GPU utilization to minimize interference. Furthermore, CARMA
introduces a recovery method to ensure robust restart of tasks that crash. Our

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained prominence as a viable
framework for exploiting near-term quantum devices in applications ranging from
optimization and chemistry simulation to machine learning. However, the
effectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau
problem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit
depth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the
barren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid
regions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL
algorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal
Policy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as
actions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based
optimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization
using methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable
initial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions
and tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method
significantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.
Moreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple
approaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the
flexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a
promising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum
algorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization
can accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs. Opening up a
promising path for the research community in machine learning for quantum,
especially barren plateau problems in VQAs.

Abstract: Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central
challenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided
protein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data
are available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by
providing evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have
enabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables
that capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of
SAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been
systematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2
embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks.
We show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or

sparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations
that generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering
predictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding

Abstract: Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a
few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or
incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is
unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the
target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and
negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware
retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval
with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data
regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source
subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target
query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided
reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs
and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning
process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,
Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms
strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable
knowledge transfer pathways.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning aim
to recover near-optimal value functions or reward models from a fixed batch of
logged trajectories, yet current practice still struggles to enforce Bellman
consistency. Bellman residual minimization (BRM) has emerged as an attractive
remedy, as a globally convergent stochastic gradient descent-ascent based
method for BRM has been recently discovered. However, its statistical behavior
in the offline setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we close this
statistical gap. Our analysis introduces a single Lyapunov potential that
couples SGDA runs on neighbouring datasets and yields an O(1/n) on-average
argument-stability bound-doubling the best known sample-complexity exponent for
convex-concave saddle problems. The same stability constant translates into the
O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM, without variance reduction, extra
regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling.
The results hold for standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch
SGD.

TL;DR: 该论文研究联邦学习中客户端标签集异构性问题，比较了公开标签集和私有标签集设置下的模型性能，提出了标准联邦学习方法的适应性改进，并在保持隐私的同时实现了相似的模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实联邦学习应用中普遍存在客户端标签集异构性问题，但现有研究很少关注。特别是当客户端只与中央服务器共享私有标签集时，学习算法面临更多约束，这是一个更困难的问题需要解决。

Method: 应用分类器组合问题的经典方法到联邦学习中进行集中调优，将常见联邦学习方法适配到私有标签集设置，并在实际假设下讨论两种方法的合理性。

Result: 实验显示减少每个客户端可用标签数量会显著损害所有方法的性能。集中调优客户端模型进行表示对齐可以缓解这一问题，但通常以更高方差为代价。提出的标准联邦学习方法适应性改进在私有标签设置下表现良好，与标准方法在公开设置下的性能相似。

Conclusion: 客户端可以在几乎不损失模型精度的情况下享受更高的隐私保护，标准联邦学习方法可以有效地适配到私有标签集设置。

Abstract: Although common in real-world applications, heterogeneous client label sets
are rarely investigated in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, in the cases
they are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets
with other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only
with the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and
is, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the
effects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public
and private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is
known to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the
classifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL
methods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both
approaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the
number of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods
substantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational
alignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance.
Throughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well,
showing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard
methods achieve in the public setting. This shows that clients can enjoy
increased privacy at little cost to model accuracy.

Abstract: Molecular structure generation is a fundamental problem that involves
determining the 3D positions of molecules' constituents. It has crucial
biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and
molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion
models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling
molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow
matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and
inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping
function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to
\textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source
distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This
yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that
is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental
properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful
techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein
docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the
method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of
task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar
computational budget.

covariant gauge fixing. This mapping identifies the gauge parameter with kernel
design choices in wide DNNs, relating stability thresholds to gauge-dependent

in QED. As a proof of concept, we validate the theoretical predictions through
numerical simulations of standard multilayer perceptrons and, in parallel,

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely applied to optimize expensive
black-box functions while retaining sample efficiency. However, scaling BO to
high-dimensional spaces remains challenging. Existing literature proposes
performing standard BO in multiple local trust regions (TuRBO) for
heterogeneous modeling of the objective function and avoiding over-exploration.
Despite its advantages, using local Gaussian Processes (GPs) reduces sampling
efficiency compared to a global GP. To enhance sampling efficiency while
preserving heterogeneous modeling, we propose to construct multiple local
quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new
sample points by solving the bound-constrained quadratic program. Additionally,
we address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.
We provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results
that our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of
high-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world
applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their
ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of
generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly
used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model
to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several
pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the
generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple
rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing
properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model
faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this
gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and
composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies
reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained
models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the
constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based
primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image
generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned
or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the
equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at

Abstract: Accurately predicting the drift (displacement) of leeway objects in maritime
environments remains a critical challenge, particularly in time-sensitive
scenarios such as search and rescue operations. In this study, we propose a
multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer
embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict
the drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting
environmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,
object mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using
simulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural
network on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift
coefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive
the net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time
series, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and
object-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a
language model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence
long-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift
trajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,
$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different
objects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and
traditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and
temporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal
models perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term
forecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings
demonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate
and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime
conditions.

Abstract: Digital healthcare systems have enabled the collection of mass healthcare
data in electronic healthcare records (EHRs), allowing artificial intelligence
solutions for various healthcare prediction tasks. However, existing studies
often focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting their predictive
performance and interpretability. To address this gap, we propose ProtoEHR, an
interpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that fully exploits the
rich, multi-level structure of EHR data to enhance healthcare predictions. More
specifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three
hierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We
first leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among
medical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source.
Building on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework
that captures contextualized representations across three levels, while
incorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic
similarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment,
we evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant
tasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction
of length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The
results demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and
interpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature. Furthermore,
ProtoEHR offers interpretable insights on code, visit, and patient levels to
aid in healthcare prediction.

Abstract: Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and
unstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables
privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains
vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange.
These challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating
zero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address
these challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated
learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based
sequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential
privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and
integrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and
secure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation
mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to
enhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and
quantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind
power data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind
farm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated
learning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its
effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in

exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based
reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the
agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining
high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo

outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These

Conclusion: SPF框架为复杂系统的数据驱动预测提供了一种内存高效且长时精度优越的解决方案，特别适合资源受限的应用场景。

Abstract: Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional
numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost.
Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error
accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU
memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic
PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while
enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model
predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition
strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing
overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping
memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the
Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher
long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory
requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

Method: 开发了物理信息声学模型(PIAM)，应用非线性声学原理从原始电话会议音频中稳健提取情绪特征，将声学和文本情绪状态投影到三维情感状态标签空间(紧张度、稳定性、唤醒度)，使用1,795个财报电话会议数据集构建特征。

Result: 多模态特征虽然不能预测股票方向性收益，但能解释高达43.8%的样本外30天已实现波动率方差，情绪动态变化(特别是从脚本演讲到自发问答的过渡期间)是波动率预测的主要驱动因素。

Abstract: Information asymmetry in financial markets, often amplified by strategically
crafted corporate narratives, undermines the effectiveness of conventional
textual analysis. We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk
assessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived
from executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this
framework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies
nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw
teleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both
acoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable
three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and
Arousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),
we construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between
scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a
pronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not
forecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the
out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility
predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive
transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual
stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant
arousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal
approach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the
complementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding
latent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our
methodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing
market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to remove the effect of specific data
from trained models to ensure individuals' privacy. Existing methods focus on
the removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However,
recent studies on the \emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption
might be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no
study has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential
privacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper
takes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples'
privacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the
privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the
perspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the
auditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA,
utilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our
experimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning
algorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for
differentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning
algorithms. For reproducibility, we have pubished our code:

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine
Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the
training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the
visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of
participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third
parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by
submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning
attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce
misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage
defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the
robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series
transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious
models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of
adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based
aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine
clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method
against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive
optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy,
maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial
conditions.

Abstract: The contextual duelling bandit problem models adaptive recommender systems,
where the algorithm presents a set of items to the user, and the user's choice
reveals their preference. This setup is well suited for implicit choices users
make when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible
comparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable
feedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be
described as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after
consuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen
from the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison
item can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading
to better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of
the temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we
first show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the
history is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition. We then show
that a short initial random exploration phase is sufficient for the algorithm
to accumulate a rich history with high probability. This result, proven via
matrix concentration bounds, yields $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.
Additionally, our simulations show that reusing past items for comparisons can
lead to significantly lower regret than only comparing between simultaneously
recommended items.

Conclusion: DNP通过结合全局和距离感知的局部潜在结构，显著改进了神经过程的不确定性估计能力，为不确定性校准提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose the Distance-informed Neural Process (DNP), a novel variant of
Neural Processes that improves uncertainty estimation by combining global and
distance-aware local latent structures. Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often
rely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and
capturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by
introducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local
latent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent
space. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds
distortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative
distances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce
better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in-
from out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves
strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across
regression and classification tasks.

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) are a popular type of
deep learning model that operate with continuous-depth architectures. To assess
how well such models perform on unseen data, it is crucial to understand their
generalization error bounds. Previous research primarily focused on the linear
case for the dynamics function in neural ODEs - Marion, P. (2023), or provided
bounds for Neural Controlled ODEs that depend on the sampling interval
Bleistein et al. (2023). In this work, we analyze a broader class of neural
ODEs where the dynamics function is a general nonlinear function, either time
dependent or time independent, and is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the
state variables. We showed that under this Lipschitz condition, the solutions
to neural ODEs have solutions with bounded variations. Based on this
observation, we establish generalization bounds for both time-dependent and
time-independent cases and investigate how overparameterization and domain
constraints influence these bounds. To our knowledge, this is the first
derivation of generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear
dynamics.

pre-training a transformer on next-state prediction, and fine-tuning for
safety-critical control. Our results show that Koopman embeddings outperform
both standard and physics-informed PCA baselines, achieving accurate and
data-efficient performance. Notably, fixing the pre-trained transformer weights
during fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating that the
learned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than
task-specific patterns. These findings support the use of Koopman embeddings as

Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) has gained attention for its ability
to accommodate diverse models and heterogeneous data across clients.
Prototype-based HFL methods emerge as a promising solution to address
statistical heterogeneity and privacy challenges, paving the way for new
advancements in HFL research. This method focuses on sharing only
class-representative prototypes among heterogeneous clients. However, these
prototypes are often aggregated on the server using weighted averaging, leading
to sub-optimal global knowledge; these cause the shrinking of aggregated
prototypes, which negatively affects the model performance in scenarios when
models are heterogeneous and data distributions are extremely non-IID. We
propose FedProtoKD in a Heterogeneous Federated Learning setting, using an
enhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism to improve the system
performance with clients' logits and prototype feature representation. We aim
to resolve the prototype margin-shrinking problem using a contrastive
learning-based trainable server prototype by leveraging a class-wise adaptive
prototype margin. Furthermore, we assess the importance of public samples using
the closeness of the sample's prototype to its class representative prototypes,
which enhances learning performance. FedProtoKD achieved average improvements
of 1.13% up to 34.13% accuracy across various settings and significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.

Abstract: Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as
completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in
industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly
non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff,
which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to
the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal
bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on
the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a
public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff
consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for
longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it
produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to
window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support
dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for
industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions
to broader domains.

Abstract: Machine learning models are often learned by minimising a loss function on
the training data using a gradient descent algorithm. These models often suffer
from overfitting, leading to a decline in predictive performance on unseen
data. A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set,
which halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing.
However, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper
presents {\sc gradstop}, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only
uses information in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent
algorithm ``for free.'' Our main contributions are that we estimate the
Bayesian posterior by the gradient information, define the early stopping
problem as drawing sample from this posterior, and use the approximated
posterior to obtain a stopping criterion. Our empirical evaluation shows that
{\sc gradstop} achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a
validation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for
training, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings,
such as transfer learning. It can be incorporated as an optional feature in
gradient descent libraries with only a small computational overhead. The source

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical
simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of
physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training
domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains
uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their
traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in
conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and
theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node
graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat
equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN
achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme
with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show
that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of
the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an
unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a
residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no
access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by
considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN
using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order
correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the
classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm
in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be
active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.

prediction has been transforming operational weather forecasting by providing
more accurate forecasts while using a mere fraction of computing power compared
to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP). However, those models still
rely on initial conditions from NWP, putting an upper limit on their forecast
abilities. A few end-to-end systems have since been proposed, but they have yet
to match the forecast skill of state-of-the-art NWP competitors. In this work,
we propose Huracan, an observation-driven weather forecasting system which
combines an ensemble data assimilation model with a forecast model to produce
highly accurate forecasts relying only on observations as inputs. Huracan is
not only the first to provide ensemble initial conditions and end-to-end
ensemble weather forecasts, but also the first end-to-end system to achieve an
accuracy comparable with that of ECMWF ENS, the state-of-the-art NWP
competitor, despite using a smaller amount of available observation data.
Notably, Huracan matches or exceeds the continuous ranked probability score of
ECMWF ENS on 75.4% of the variable and lead time combinations. Our work is a
major step forward in end-to-end data-driven weather prediction and opens up
opportunities for further improving and revolutionizing operational weather
forecasting.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出ModAn-MulSupCon方法，利用医学影像的模态和解剖结构元数据作为多标签监督对比学习信号，在医学影像预训练中取得优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像领域专家标注成本高昂，而模态和解剖结构等元数据普遍存在但未被充分利用。研究旨在探索如何利用这些易获取的元数据来学习可迁移的表示

Method: 将每张图像的模态和解剖结构编码为多热向量，使用ResNet-18编码器在miniRIN数据集上进行Jaccard加权的多标签监督对比学习预训练

Result: 在微调设置下，ModAn-MulSupCon在ACL撕裂和甲状腺结节恶性分类任务上达到最佳AUC（0.964和0.763），在乳腺病变恶性分类上排名第二（0.926）。但在冻结编码器设置下，SimCLR/ImageNet表现更优

Conclusion: 利用模态和解剖结构元数据作为多标签目标提供了一种实用、可扩展的预训练信号，特别适合标签稀缺的临床环境。当微调可行时能显著提升下游任务性能

Abstract: Background and objective: Expert annotations limit large-scale supervised
pretraining in medical imaging, while ubiquitous metadata (modality, anatomical
region) remain underused. We introduce ModAn-MulSupCon, a modality- and
anatomy-aware multi-label supervised contrastive pretraining method that
leverages such metadata to learn transferable representations.
  Method: Each image's modality and anatomy are encoded as a multi-hot vector.
A ResNet-18 encoder is pretrained on a mini subset of RadImageNet (miniRIN,
16,222 images) with a Jaccard-weighted multi-label supervised contrastive loss,
and then evaluated by fine-tuning and linear probing on three binary
classification tasks--ACL tear (knee MRI), lesion malignancy (breast
ultrasound), and nodule malignancy (thyroid ultrasound).
  Result: With fine-tuning, ModAn-MulSupCon achieved the best AUC on MRNet-ACL
(0.964) and Thyroid (0.763), surpassing all baselines ($p<0.05$), and ranked
second on Breast (0.926) behind SimCLR (0.940; not significant). With the
encoder frozen, SimCLR/ImageNet were superior, indicating that ModAn-MulSupCon
representations benefit most from task adaptation rather than linear
separability.
  Conclusion: Encoding readily available modality/anatomy metadata as
multi-label targets provides a practical, scalable pretraining signal that
improves downstream accuracy when fine-tuning is feasible. ModAn-MulSupCon is a
strong initialization for label-scarce clinical settings, whereas
SimCLR/ImageNet remain preferable for frozen-encoder deployments.

Result: 离线实验显示预训练阶段多轮训练不会导致过拟合，在线部署在Pinterest获得显著的全站参与度提升

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了ID嵌入的过拟合问题，通过预训练提升泛化性能，在实际推荐系统中验证了有效性

Abstract: ID-based embeddings are widely used in web-scale online recommendation
systems. However, their susceptibility to overfitting, particularly due to the
long-tail nature of data distributions, often limits training to a single
epoch, a phenomenon known as the "one-epoch problem." This challenge has driven
research efforts to optimize performance within the first epoch by enhancing
convergence speed or feature sparsity. In this study, we introduce a novel
two-stage training strategy that incorporates a pre-training phase using a
minimal model with contrastive loss, enabling broader data coverage for the
embedding system. Our offline experiments demonstrate that multi-epoch training
during the pre-training phase does not lead to overfitting, and the resulting
embeddings improve online generalization when fine-tuned for more complex
downstream recommendation tasks. We deployed the proposed system in live
traffic at Pinterest, achieving significant site-wide engagement gains.

TL;DR: 本研究首次将最先进的注意力机制（包括加性注意力、Luong三种注意力、全局自注意力和滑动窗口稀疏注意力）应用于420只美国大盘股的实证资产定价研究，解决了传统机器学习方法在时间依赖性和短期记忆方面的局限性，并通过因果掩码防止未来数据泄露。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在资产定价中存在时间依赖性捕捉不足和短期记忆问题，且先进注意力模型（如经典Transformer）忽略了未来数据泄露问题。本研究旨在将最先进的注意力机制应用于资产定价，解决这些问题并考虑资产定价数据的时间稀疏特性。

Method: 使用预训练的RNN注意力模型，包含四种主流注意力机制：加性注意力、Luong三种注意力、全局自注意力和滑动窗口稀疏注意力。采用因果掩码防止未来数据泄露，简化模型结构缓解过拟合。在三个不同市场时期（COVID-19前、期间和之后）进行测试。

Result: 在价值加权组合回测中，全局自注意力模型和稀疏注意力模型在获取绝对收益和对冲下行风险方面表现优异，在COVID-19期间分别实现了2.0和1.80的年化Sortino比率。稀疏注意力模型在绝对组合收益方面相对于股票市值规模表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 注意力机制特别是稀疏注意力模型在资产定价中表现出色，能够有效处理时间依赖性问题并防止数据泄露，为未来实证经济研究提供了有价值的见解。模型在不同市场条件下（包括极端市场条件）都表现出良好的稳定性。

Abstract: This study investigates the pretrained RNN attention models with the
mainstream attention mechanisms such as additive attention, Luong's three
attentions, global self-attention (Self-att) and sliding window sparse
attention (Sparse-att) for the empirical asset pricing research on top 420
large-cap US stocks. This is the first paper on the large-scale
state-of-the-art (SOTA) attention mechanisms applied in the asset pricing
context. They overcome the limitations of the traditional machine learning (ML)
based asset pricing, such as mis-capturing the temporal dependency and short
memory. Moreover, the enforced causal masks in the attention mechanisms address
the future data leaking issue ignored by the more advanced attention-based
models, such as the classic Transformer. The proposed attention models also
consider the temporal sparsity characteristic of asset pricing data and
mitigate potential overfitting issues by deploying the simplified model
structures. This provides some insights for future empirical economic research.
All models are examined in three periods, which cover pre-COVID-19 (mild
uptrend), COVID-19 (steep uptrend with a large drawdown) and one year
post-COVID-19 (sideways movement with high fluctuations), for testing the
stability of these models under extreme market conditions. The study finds that
in value-weighted portfolio back testing, Model Self-att and Model Sparse-att
exhibit great capabilities in deriving the absolute returns and hedging
downside risks, while they achieve an annualized Sortino ratio of 2.0 and 1.80
respectively in the period with COVID-19. And Model Sparse-att performs more
stably than Model Self-att from the perspective of absolute portfolio returns
with respect to the size of stocks' market capitalization.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have become increasingly popular in
information processing tasks involving time series and temporal data. A
fundamental property of RNNs is their ability to create reliable input/output
responses, often linked to how the network handles its memory of the
information it processed. Various notions have been proposed to conceptualize
the behavior of memory in RNNs, including steady states, echo states, state
forgetting, input forgetting, and fading memory. Although these notions are
often used interchangeably, their precise relationships remain unclear. This
work aims to unify these notions in a common language, derive new implications
and equivalences between them, and provide alternative proofs to some existing
results. By clarifying the relationships between these concepts, this research
contributes to a deeper understanding of RNNs and their temporal information
processing capabilities.

Conclusion: 该方法为利用先前规划和控制数据生成计算高效且足够表达力的新任务动力学模型提供了一条可行路径

Abstract: Efficient planning in high-dimensional spaces, such as those involving
deformable objects, requires computationally tractable yet sufficiently
expressive dynamics models. This paper introduces a method that automatically
generates task-specific, spatially adaptive dynamics models by learning which
regions of the object require high-resolution modeling to achieve good task
performance for a given planning query. Task performance depends on the complex
interplay between the dynamics model, world dynamics, control, and task
requirements. Our proposed diffusion-based model generator predicts per-region
model resolutions based on start and goal pointclouds that define the planning
query. To efficiently collect the data for learning this mapping, a two-stage
process optimizes resolution using predictive dynamics as a prior before
directly optimizing using closed-loop performance. On a tree-manipulation task,
our method doubles planning speed with only a small decrease in task
performance over using a full-resolution model. This approach informs a path
towards using previous planning and control data to generate computationally
efficient yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models for new tasks.

Motivation: HSIC虽然是评估统计依赖性的最先进方法，但对于大规模数据样本需要O(n^2.37)的计算复杂度，在实际应用中不实用。需要开发更高效的替代方法。

Method: 提出HCR方法，通过特征混合矩来描述依赖性，从相关性和同方差性开始。每个依赖性描述特征可以在线性时间O(n)内计算，测试数量随维度d变化（成对依赖需要O(d^2)，三重依赖需要O(d^3)等）。

Result: HCR不仅计算效率更高（线性成本），而且在测试中具有更高的依赖性敏感性，同时提供实际的联合分布模型，可以通过混合矩的平方和来近似互信息。

Conclusion: HCR是HSIC的一个实用线性成本替代方案，适用于大规模数据分析，能够有效描述统计依赖性并提供联合分布建模。

Abstract: Evaluation of statistical dependencies between two data samples is a basic
problem of data science/machine learning, and HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Information
Criterion)~\cite{HSIC} is considered the state-of-art method. However, for size
$n$ data sample it requires multiplication of $n\times n$ matrices, what
currently needs $\sim O(n^{2.37})$ computational complexity~\cite{mult}, making
it impractical for large data samples. We discuss HCR (Hierarchical Correlation
Reconstruction) as its linear cost practical alternative of even higher
dependence sensitivity in tests, and additionally providing actual joint
distribution model by description of dependencies through features being mixed
moments, starting with correlation and homoscedasticity, also allowing to
approximate mutual information as just sum of squares of such nontrivial mixed
moments between two data samples. Such single dependence describing feature is
calculated in $O(n)$ linear time. Their number to test varies with dimension
$d$ - requiring $O(d^2)$ for pairwise dependencies, $O(d^3)$ if wanting to also
consider more subtle triplewise, and so on.

Abstract: Forecasting production reliably and anticipating changes in the behavior of
rock-fluid systems are the main challenges in petroleum reservoir engineering.
This project proposes to deal with this problem through a data-driven approach
and using machine learning methods. The objective is to develop a methodology
to forecast production parameters based on simple data as produced and injected
volumes and, eventually, gauges located in wells, without depending on
information from geological models, fluid properties or details of well
completions and flow systems. Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the
production and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit
the problem. As reservoir conditions change over time, concept drift is a
priority concern and require special attention to those observation windows and
the periodicity of retraining, which are also objects of study. For the
production forecasts, we study supervised learning methods, such as those based
on regressions and Neural Networks, to define the most suitable for our
application in terms of performance and complexity. In a first step, we
evaluate the methodology using synthetic data generated from the UNISIM III
compositional simulation model. Next, we applied it to cases of real plays in
the Brazilian pre-salt. The expected result is the design of a reliable
predictor for reproducing reservoir dynamics, with rapid response, capability
of dealing with practical difficulties such as restrictions in wells and
processing units, and that can be used in actions to support reservoir
management, including the anticipation of deleterious behaviors, optimization
of production and injection parameters and the analysis of the effects of
probabilistic events, aiming to maximize oil recovery.

NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion
strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful
interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and
established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance
interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the
attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient
interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent
representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism
spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that
NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically
plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial task that guides the design of new
compounds, including drugs and materials. While explainable artificial
intelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying
influential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking
strategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance
via fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the
underlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In
this work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces
masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from
generative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating
masked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them
relative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our
method offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and
distribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that
directly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties.
We demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking
model explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets
and property prediction tasks. Our approach bridges the gap between
explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path
toward explainable machine learning in chemistry.

that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine
learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet
patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms
underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold
promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack
interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure
inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled
Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates
transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific
encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a
modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn
biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and
metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four
cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response
(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance
mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal
signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous
biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations
of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes
and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate
interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the
value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex
resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

Conclusion: 结合结构学习和跨阶段监督的方法在RTL设计质量估计中非常有效。

Abstract: Estimating the quality of register transfer level (RTL) designs is crucial in
the electronic design automation (EDA) workflow, as it enables instant feedback
on key metrics like area and delay without the need for time-consuming logic
synthesis. While recent approaches have leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to derive embeddings from RTL code and achieved promising results, they
overlook the structural semantics essential for accurate quality estimation. In
contrast, the control data flow graph (CDFG) view exposes the design's
structural characteristics more explicitly, offering richer cues for
representation learning. In this work, we introduce a novel structure-aware
graph self-supervised learning framework, StructRTL, for improved RTL design
quality estimation. By learning structure-informed representations from CDFGs,
our method significantly outperforms prior art on various quality estimation
tasks. To further boost performance, we incorporate a knowledge distillation

TL;DR: MOCHA是一个用于时序点过程中发现多阶动态因果关系的框架，通过时间演化的有向无环图建模多阶影响，实现了准确的事件预测和可解释的因果结构发现。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖静态或一阶因果结构，忽略了因果关系的多阶性和时变特性，需要新的框架来发现时序点过程中的复杂因果依赖。

Method: 提出MOCHA框架，将多阶影响建模为潜在时间演化图上的多跳因果路径，使用时变有向无环图（DAG）和可学习结构权重，施加无环性和稀疏性约束，采用端到端可微分框架联合建模因果发现和TPP动态。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，MOCHA在事件预测方面达到了最先进的性能，同时揭示了有意义且可解释的因果结构。

Conclusion: MOCHA成功解决了时序点过程中多阶动态因果关系的发现问题，为复杂事件序列建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Discovering complex causal dependencies in temporal point processes (TPPs) is
critical for modeling real-world event sequences. Existing methods typically
rely on static or first-order causal structures, overlooking the multi-order
and time-varying nature of causal relationships. In this paper, we propose
MOCHA, a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in TPPs.
MOCHA characterizes multi-order influences as multi-hop causal paths over a
latent time-evolving graph. To model such dynamics, we introduce a time-varying
directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights, where
acyclicity and sparsity constraints are enforced to ensure structural validity.
We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal
discovery and TPP dynamics, enabling accurate event prediction and revealing
interpretable structures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event
prediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.

Conclusion: pyFAST为时间序列研究提供了一个紧凑而强大的平台，支持快速实验和扩展

Abstract: Modern time series analysis demands frameworks that are flexible, efficient,
and extensible. However, many existing Python libraries exhibit limitations in
modularity and in their native support for irregular, multi-source, or sparse
data. We introduce pyFAST, a research-oriented PyTorch framework that
explicitly decouples data processing from model computation, fostering a
cleaner separation of concerns and facilitating rapid experimentation. Its data
engine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading,
protein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic
normalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting.
pyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of
sparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss
functions, and flexible exogenous data fusion. Training utilities include
batch-based streaming aggregation for evaluation and device synergy to maximize
computational efficiency. A comprehensive suite of classical and deep learning
models (Linears, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GNNs) is provided within a
modular architecture that encourages extension. Released under the MIT license
at GitHub, pyFAST provides a compact yet powerful platform for advancing time
series research and applications.

Conclusion: 这个简单模型有助于从物理角度理解学习系统，揭示了热力学性质与学习能力之间的关系

Abstract: Learning is a physical process. Here, we aim to study a simple dynamical
system composed of springs and sticks capable of arbitrarily approximating any
continuous function. The main idea of our work is to use the sticks to mimic a
piecewise-linear approximation of the given function, use the potential energy
of springs to encode a desired mean squared error loss function, and converge
to a minimum-energy configuration via dissipation. We apply the proposed
simulation system to regression tasks and show that its performance is
comparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons. In addition, we study the
thermodynamic properties of the system and find a relation between the free
energy change of the system and its ability to learn an underlying data
distribution. We empirically find a \emph{thermodynamic learning barrier} for
the system caused by the fluctuations of the environment, whereby the system
cannot learn if its change in free energy hits such a barrier. We believe this
simple model can help us better understand learning systems from a physical
point of view.

Conclusion: 资源中心的下一活动预测方法能够实现更智能的资源分配、战略性劳动力规划和个性化员工支持，为预测性流程监控研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to train models that forecast
upcoming events in process executions. These predictions support early
bottleneck detection, improved scheduling, proactive interventions, and timely
communication with stakeholders. While existing research adopts a control-flow
perspective, we investigate next-activity prediction from a resource-centric
viewpoint, which offers additional benefits such as improved work organization,
workload balancing, and capacity forecasting. Although resource information has
been shown to enhance tasks such as process performance analysis, its role in
next-activity prediction remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four
prediction models and three encoding strategies across four real-life datasets.
Compared to the baseline, our results show that LightGBM and Transformer models
perform best with an encoding based on 2-gram activity transitions, while
Random Forest benefits most from an encoding that combines 2-gram transitions
and activity repetition features. This combined encoding also achieves the
highest average accuracy. This resource-centric approach could enable smarter
resource allocation, strategic workforce planning, and personalized employee
support by analyzing individual behavior rather than case-level progression.
The findings underscore the potential of resource-centric next-activity
prediction, opening up new venues for research on PPM.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense

oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various
similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and
anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets,
including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the
choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly
detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights
for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for
threat intelligence and cyber defense.

Motivation: 传统地震动预测模型(GMMs)存在两个主要问题：1) 黑盒模型缺乏可解释性，限制了在高风险决策中的应用；2) 地震数据严重不平衡，近场大震级关键记录稀少而远场小震级记录丰富。

Method: 开发了使用HazBinLoss函数的透明ML架构，每个输入特征（如震级、距离等）单独处理并线性相加获得输出，确保每个项的精确贡献。HazBinLoss函数在训练时为关键近场大震级记录分配更高权重，为次要远场小震级记录分配较低权重。

Result: 模型能够捕捉已知地震学原理，在保持透明度的同时，与已建立的GMMs达到相当的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该框架使基于ML的风险评估研究和灾害规划得到更广泛采用，提供了可解释且可靠的预测模型。

Abstract: Ground motion models (GMMs) predict how strongly the ground will shake during
an earthquake. They are essential for structural analysis, seismic design, and
seismic risk assessment studies. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches
are popular to develop GMMs, due to large earthquake databases worldwide.
However, they operate as "black boxes," which are hard to interpret and trust,
limiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, these databases
suffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging
records near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant
records. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a
transparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g.,
magnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and
added linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each
term. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field
large magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller
magnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most
damaging scenarios. Our model captures known seismological principles and
achieves comparable performance with established GMMs while maintaining
transparency. This framework enables broader adoption of ML-based approaches
for risk assessment studies and disaster planning.

Conclusion: TRIGON通过创新的三角形选择和图重布线方法，有效解决了GNN中的拓扑限制问题，在多个基准测试中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for
learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by
issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these
limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective
information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework
that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select
relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle
selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a
rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced
diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to
existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a
range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

Abstract: Emotions are inherently ambiguous and dynamic phenomena, yet existing
continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore their ambiguity or
treat ambiguity as an independent and static variable over time. Motivated by
this gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce \emph{ambiguity-aware
ordinal} emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the
ambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of
emotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion
ambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two
affective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on
both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces.
Our results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional
ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance
Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores,
highlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded
traces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability
to capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.

Abstract: The secondary use of healthcare data is vital for research and clinical
innovation, but it raises concerns about patient privacy. This study
investigates how to balance privacy preservation and data utility in healthcare
data sharing, considering the perspectives of both data providers and data
users. Using a dataset of adult patients hospitalized between 2013 and 2015, we
predict whether sepsis was present at admission or developed during the
hospital stay. We identify sub-populations, such as older adults, frequently
hospitalized patients, and racial minorities, that are especially vulnerable to
privacy attacks due to their unique combinations of demographic and healthcare
utilization attributes. These groups are also critical for machine learning
(ML) model performance. We evaluate three anonymization methods-$k$-anonymity,
the technique by Zheng et al., and the MO-OBAM model-based on their ability to
reduce re-identification risk while maintaining ML utility. Results show that
$k$-anonymity offers limited protection. The methods of Zheng et al. and
MO-OBAM provide stronger privacy safeguards, with MO-OBAM yielding the best
utility outcomes: only a 2% change in precision and recall compared to the
original dataset. This work provides actionable insights for healthcare
organizations on how to share data responsibly. It highlights the need for
anonymization methods that protect vulnerable populations without sacrificing

Result: 建立了FTPL在广泛非对称无界Fréchet型扰动下的BOBW结果，在双臂赌博机中获得了对称无界扰动的首个BOBW保证。但在多臂赌博机中发现对称Fréchet型扰动可能违反标准BOBW分析的关键条件。

Conclusion: FTPL可以通过适当的扰动设计实现与混合正则化方法竞争的性能，但对称扰动在一般多臂设置中存在局限性，需要进一步研究来全面理解FTPL在更广泛设置中的行为。

Abstract: Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) policies have achieved
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) results in various settings through hybrid
regularizers, whereas analogous results for Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL)
remain limited due to inherent analytical challenges. To advance the analytical
foundations of FTPL, we revisit classical FTRL-FTPL duality for unbounded
perturbations and establish BOBW results for FTPL under a broad family of
asymmetric unbounded Fr\'echet-type perturbations, including hybrid
perturbations combining Gumbel-type and Fr\'echet-type tails. These results not
only extend the BOBW results of FTPL but also offer new insights into designing
alternative FTPL policies competitive with hybrid regularization approaches.
Motivated by earlier observations in two-armed bandits, we further investigate
the connection between the $1/2$-Tsallis entropy and a Fr\'echet-type
perturbation. Our numerical observations suggest that it corresponds to a
symmetric Fr\'echet-type perturbation, and based on this, we establish the
first BOBW guarantee for symmetric unbounded perturbations in the two-armed
setting. In contrast, in general multi-armed bandits, we find an instance in
which symmetric Fr\'echet-type perturbations violate the key condition for
standard BOBW analysis, which is a problem not observed with asymmetric or
nonnegative Fr\'echet-type perturbations. Although this example does not rule
out alternative analyses achieving BOBW results, it suggests the limitations of
directly applying the relationship observed in two-armed cases to the general
case and thus emphasizes the need for further investigation to fully understand
the behavior of FTPL in broader settings.

Abstract: Robust generalization is essential for deploying deep learning based tumor
segmentation in clinical PET-CT workflows, where anatomical sites, scanners,
and patient populations vary widely. This study presents the first cross cancer
evaluation of nnU-Net on PET-CT, introducing two novel, expert-annotated
whole-body datasets. 279 patients with oesophageal cancer (Australian cohort)
and 54 with lung cancer (Indian cohort). These cohorts complement the public
AutoPET dataset and enable systematic stress-testing of cross domain
performance. We trained and tested 3D nnUNet models under three paradigms.
Target only (oesophageal), public only (AutoPET), and combined training. For
the tested sets, the oesophageal only model achieved the best in-domain
accuracy (mean DSC, 57.8) but failed on external Indian lung cohort (mean DSC
less than 3.4), indicating severe overfitting. The public only model
generalized more broadly (mean DSC, 63.5 on AutoPET, 51.6 on Indian lung
cohort) but underperformed in oesophageal Australian cohort (mean DSC, 26.7).
The combined approach provided the most balanced results (mean DSC, lung
(52.9), oesophageal (40.7), AutoPET (60.9)), reducing boundary errors and
improving robustness across all cohorts. These findings demonstrate that
dataset diversity, particularly multi demographic, multi center and multi
cancer integration, outweighs architectural novelty as the key driver of robust
generalization. This work presents the demography based cross cancer deep
learning segmentation evaluation and highlights dataset diversity, rather than
model complexity, as the foundation for clinically robust segmentation.

Abstract: We introduce the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm for contextual

efficient implementations. Beyond regret bounds, we tackle the practical
bottleneck in FTRL (or, equivalently, Online Stochastic Mirror Descent) arising
from the high-dimensional projection step encountered in each round of
interaction. By leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, we transform the
$K$-dimensional convex projection problem into a single-variable root-finding
problem, dramatically accelerating each round. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that this combined strategy not only attains the attractive regret
bounds of best-of-both-worlds algorithms but also delivers substantial
per-round speed-ups, making it well-suited for large-scale, real-time

TL;DR: 提出了TRNO（温度感知循环神经算子）架构，用于模拟多晶镁的温度依赖性塑性响应，相比传统GRU/LSTM模型在训练效率和预测性能上更优，并能实现三个数量级的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络代理模型在塑性力学中存在训练时间长、时间分辨率依赖性强、外推能力差等问题，且大多只能处理简单材料行为，需要开发更高效的架构来处理复杂温度依赖性塑性响应。

Method: 提出Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO)架构，这是一种时间分辨率无关的神经架构，专门用于建模多晶镁的温度依赖性塑性响应。

Result: TRNO在预测准确性方面表现优异，能够有效泛化到不同的加载情况、温度和时间分辨率。相比传统GRU和LSTM模型，在训练效率和预测性能上都有显著提升。

Conclusion: TRNO架构成功解决了传统方法的局限性，在多尺度模拟中实现了至少三个数量级的加速，为计算力学中的本构关系建模提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network surrogate models for constitutive laws in computational
mechanics have been in use for some time. In plasticity, these models often
rely on gated recurrent units (GRUs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) cells,
which excel at capturing path-dependent phenomena. However, they suffer from
long training times and time-resolution-dependent predictions that extrapolate
poorly. Moreover, most existing surrogates for macro- or mesoscopic plasticity
handle only relatively simple material behavior. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce the Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO), a
time-resolution-independent neural architecture. We apply the TRNO to model the
temperature-dependent plastic response of polycrystalline magnesium, which
shows strong plastic anisotropy and thermal sensitivity. The TRNO achieves high
predictive accuracy and generalizes effectively across diverse loading cases,
temperatures, and time resolutions. It also outperforms conventional GRU and
LSTM models in training efficiency and predictive performance. Finally, we
demonstrate multiscale simulations with the TRNO, yielding a speedup of at
least three orders of magnitude over traditional constitutive models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种整合特征-特征和特征-目标关系的特征筛选方法，使用惩罚性最小冗余最大相关性(mRMR)程序识别非活跃特征，并通过knockoff滤波器控制错误发现率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法往往只考虑特征与目标的关系，忽略了特征间的相互关系。需要一种能够同时考虑特征-特征和特征-目标关系，并能控制错误发现率的特征筛选方法。

Method: 使用惩罚性mRMR方法（经典mRMR的连续版本，加入非凸正则化器），通过多阶段knockoff滤波器程序来丢弃非活跃特征并控制FDR。

Result: 方法性能与HSIC-LASSO相当，但在选择特征数量上更为保守。只需要设置FDR阈值，无需指定要保留的特征数量。在模拟和真实数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的特征筛选框架，能够同时考虑特征间关系和特征-目标关系，并通过统计控制保证特征选择的可靠性。

Abstract: We propose a feature screening method that integrates both feature-feature
and feature-target relationships. Inactive features are identified via a
penalized minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) procedure, which is the
continuous version of the classic mRMR penalized by a non-convex regularizer,
and where the parameters estimated as zero coefficients represent the set of
inactive features. We establish the conditions under which zero coefficients
are correctly identified to guarantee accurate recovery of inactive features.
We introduce a multi-stage procedure based on the knockoff filter enabling the
penalized mRMR to discard inactive features while controlling the false
discovery rate (FDR). Our method performs comparably to HSIC-LASSO but is more
conservative in the number of selected features. It only requires setting an
FDR threshold, rather than specifying the number of features to retain. The
effectiveness of the method is illustrated through simulations and real-world
datasets. The code to reproduce this work is available on the following GitHub:

Abstract: This study evaluates deep neural networks for forecasting probability
distributions of financial returns. 1D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures are used to forecast parameters of
three probability distributions: Normal, Student's t, and skewed Student's t.
Using custom negative log-likelihood loss functions, distribution parameters
are optimized directly. The models are tested on six major equity indices (S\&P
500, BOVESPA, DAX, WIG, Nikkei 225, and KOSPI) using probabilistic evaluation
metrics including Log Predictive Score (LPS), Continuous Ranked Probability
Score (CRPS), and Probability Integral Transform (PIT). Results show that deep
learning models provide accurate distributional forecasts and perform
competitively with classical GARCH models for Value-at-Risk estimation. The
LSTM with skewed Student's t distribution performs best across multiple
evaluation criteria, capturing both heavy tails and asymmetry in financial
returns. This work shows that deep neural networks are viable alternatives to
traditional econometric models for financial risk assessment and portfolio

Abstract: Background: Existing robust, pervasive device-based systems developed in
recent years to detect depression require data collected over a long period and
may not be effective in cases where early detection is crucial.
  Objective: Our main objective was to develop a minimalistic system to
identify depression using data retrieved in the fastest possible time.
  Methods: We developed a fast tool that retrieves the past 7 days' app usage
data in 1 second (mean 0.31, SD 1.10 seconds). A total of 100 students from
Bangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage
data. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse
set of ML models. We selected important features using the stable approach,
along with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches.
  Results: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light
gradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the
stable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students
(precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we
presented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the
all-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and
showed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). A SHAP analysis
of our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to
depression.
  Conclusions: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a
worthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and
developing regions. In addition, our detailed discussion about the implication
of our findings can facilitate the development of less resource-intensive
systems to better understand students who are depressed.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in
intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often

time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an
end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for
automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary
sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a
customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density
segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism
for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed
dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and
noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model
achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent,
respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning
baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness,
generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across

Conclusion: 约束基模型缩减是MILP加速求解的有效方法，多模态表示技术能有效识别关键约束

Abstract: Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed
integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much
faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,
which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual
perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality
constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has
been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based
model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two
challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing
them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to
predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical
constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as
potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset
of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we
propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from
both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental
results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method
improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation
time by 17.47\%.

Abstract: Multilabel data should be analysed for label dependence before applying
multilabel models. Independence between multilabel data labels cannot be
measured directly from the label values due to their dependence on the set of
covariates $\vec{x}$, but can be measured by examining the conditional label
covariance using a multivariate Probit model. Unfortunately, the multivariate
Probit model provides an estimate of its copula covariance, and so might not be
reliable in estimating constant covariance and dependent covariance. In this
article, we compare three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli
and Staged Logit) for estimating the constant and dependent multilabel
conditional label covariance. We provide an experiment that allows us to
observe each model's measurement of conditional covariance. We found that all
models measure constant and dependent covariance equally well, depending on the
strength of the covariance, but the models all falsely detect that dependent
covariance is present for data where constant covariance is present. Of the
three models, the Multivariate Probit model had the lowest error rate.

Conclusion: 通过将EMD归约到CP并利用几何结构优化权重更新，显著提高了高维EMD近似算法的效率

Abstract: We give a reduction from $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate Earth Mover's Distance
(EMD) to $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate Closest Pair (CP). As a consequence, we
improve the fastest known approximation algorithm for high-dimensional EMD.
Here, given $p\in [1, 2]$ and two sets of $n$ points $X,Y \subseteq (\mathbb
R^d,\ell_p)$, their EMD is the minimum cost of a perfect matching between $X$
and $Y$, where the cost of matching two vectors is their $\ell_p$ distance.
Further, CP is the basic problem of finding a pair of points realizing $\min_{x
\in X, y\in Y} ||x-y||_p$. Our contribution is twofold: we show that if a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate CP can be computed in time $n^{2-\phi}$, then a
$1+O(\varepsilon)$ approximation to EMD can be computed in time
$n^{2-\Omega(\phi)}$; plugging in the fastest known algorithm for CP [Alman,
Chan, Williams FOCS'16], we obtain a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
for EMD running in time $n^{2-\tilde{\Omega}(\varepsilon^{1/3})}$ for
high-dimensional point sets, which improves over the prior fastest running time
of $n^{2-\Omega(\varepsilon^2)}$ [Andoni, Zhang FOCS'23]. Our main technical
contribution is a sublinear implementation of the Multiplicative Weights Update
framework for EMD. Specifically, we demonstrate that the updates can be
executed without ever explicitly computing or storing the weights; instead, we
exploit the underlying geometric structure to perform the updates implicitly.

Abstract: Insects control unsteady aerodynamic forces on flapping wings to navigate
complex environments. While understanding these forces is vital for biology,
physics, and engineering, existing evaluation methods face trade-offs:
high-fidelity simulations are computationally or experimentally expensive and
lack explanatory power, whereas theoretical models based on quasi-steady
assumptions offer insights but exhibit low accuracy. To overcome these
limitations and thus enhance the accuracy of quasi-steady aerodynamic models,
we applied a data-driven approach involving discovery and formulation of
previously overlooked critical mechanisms. Through selection from 5,000
candidate kinematic functions, we identified mathematical expressions for three
key additional mechanisms -- the effect of advance ratio, effect of spanwise
kinematic velocity, and rotational Wagner effect -- which had been
qualitatively recognized but were not formulated. Incorporating these
mechanisms considerably reduced the prediction errors of the quasi-steady model
using the computational fluid dynamics results as the ground truth, both in
hawkmoth forward flight (at high Reynolds numbers) and fruit fly maneuvers (at
low Reynolds numbers). The data-driven quasi-steady model enables rapid
aerodynamic analysis, serving as a practical tool for understanding
evolutionary adaptations in insect flight and developing bio-inspired flying
robots.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful
platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such
as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential
for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental
theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems
realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a
necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only
global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators
is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and
bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical
superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with
experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment
- direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex
effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware
constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body
interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics
on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key
experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position
fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration
pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal
dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming
both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new
avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the
engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of
quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

convergence rate in the objective value. This is a new theoretical result for
this type of algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method
