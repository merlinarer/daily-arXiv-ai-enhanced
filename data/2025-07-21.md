### [1] [SAFT: Structure-Aware Fine-Tuning of LLMs for AMR-to-Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13381)
*Rafiq Kamel,Filippo Guerranti,Simon Geisler,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 85.0

TL;DR: SAFT是一种结构感知的微调方法，通过注入图拓扑信息到预训练LLM中，显著提升了AMR到文本生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理结构化输入（如图）时，常忽略关键结构信息或与标准LLM不兼容，因此需要一种新方法来保留结构信息并提升性能。

Method: SAFT利用磁性拉普拉斯变换计算方向敏感的位置编码，并将其投影到LLM的嵌入空间，无需改变架构。

Result: SAFT在AMR 3.0上实现了3.5 BLEU的提升，性能增益随图复杂度增加。

Conclusion: SAFT为结构化数据与语言模型的结合提供了一种通用且有效的途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to tasks involving
structured inputs such as graphs. Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs),
which encode rich semantics as directed graphs, offer a rigorous testbed for
evaluating LLMs on text generation from such structures. Yet, current methods
often arbitrarily linearize AMRs, discarding key structural cues, or rely on
architectures incompatible with standard LLMs. We introduce SAFT, a
structure-aware fine-tuning approach that injects graph topology into
pretrained LLMs without architectural changes. We compute direction-sensitive
positional encodings from the magnetic Laplacian of transformed AMRs and
project them into the embedding space of the LLM. While possibly applicable to
any graph-structured inputs, we focus on AMR-to-text generation as a
representative and challenging benchmark. SAFT sets a new state-of-the-art on
AMR 3.0 with a 3.5 BLEU improvement over baselines. Gains scale with graph
complexity, highlighting the value of structure-aware representations in
enhancing LLM performance. SAFT offers a general and effective pathway for
bridging structured data and language models.

TL;DR: PARAM-1是一个专注于印度语言多样性的2.9B参数语言模型，通过公平的语料分配、适应印度形态的tokenizer和文化对齐的评估基准，实现了在印度多语言环境中的高效表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在英语中心化设计中对印度等多语言地区的结构性忽视问题。

Method: 训练一个2.9B参数的decoder-only模型，使用印地语和英语双语数据集，强调公平语料分配、适应印度形态的tokenizer和文化对齐的评估。

Result: PARAM-1在印度中心化应用中表现出色，同时具备通用能力。

Conclusion: PARAM-1为公平的基础模型设计提供了蓝图，展示了在多语言环境中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful general-purpose
reasoning systems, yet their development remains dominated by English-centric
data, architectures, and optimization paradigms. This exclusionary design
results in structural under-representation of linguistically diverse regions
such as India, where over 20 official languages and 100+ dialects coexist
alongside phenomena like code-switching and diglossia. We introduce PARAM-1, a
2.9B parameter decoder-only, text-only language model trained from scratch with
an explicit architectural and linguistic focus on Indian diversity. PARAM-1 is
trained on a bilingual dataset consisting of only Hindi and English,
constructed with a strong focus on fact-rich, high-quality content. It is
guided by three core principles: equitable representation of Indic languages
through a 25% corpus allocation; tokenization fairness via a SentencePiece
tokenizer adapted to Indian morphological structures; and culturally aligned
evaluation benchmarks across IndicQA, code-mixed reasoning, and
socio-linguistic robustness tasks. By embedding diversity at the pretraining
level-rather than deferring it to post-hoc alignment-PARAM-1 offers a
design-first blueprint for equitable foundation modeling. Our results
demonstrate that it serves as both a competent general-purpose model and a
robust baseline for India-centric applications.

TL;DR: 利用稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征控制多语言大模型（LLM）的生成语言，通过修改单个SAE特征实现90%的语言切换成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言LLM在零样本设置下无法确定性控制生成语言的挑战。

Method: 利用预训练的SAE特征分析Gemma-2B和Gemma-9B的残差流，识别与目标语言相关的特征，并通过修改单个特征实现语言控制。

Result: 在Gemma模型上实现了90%的语言切换成功率，同时保持语义一致性。

Conclusion: 稀疏特征控制是一种轻量且可解释的多语言生成控制机制。

Abstract: Deterministically controlling the target generation language of large
multilingual language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge,
particularly in zero-shot settings where neither explicit language prompts nor
fine-tuning are available. In this work, we investigate whether sparse
autoencoder (SAE) features, previously shown to correlate with interpretable
model behaviors, can be leveraged to steer the generated language of LLMs
during inference. Leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of
Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B, we identify features whose activations differ most
significantly between English and four target languages: Chinese, Japanese,
Spanish, and French. By modifying just a single SAE feature at one transformer
layer, we achieve controlled language shifts with up to 90\% success, as
measured by FastText language classification, while preserving semantic
fidelity according to LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding)
similarity. Our analysis reveals that language steering is most effective in
mid-to-late transformer layers and is amplified by specific attention heads
disproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features. These
results demonstrate the promise of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and
interpretable mechanism for controllable multilingual generation.

Conclusion: ALIGNed-LLM是一种简单有效的方法，通过知识图谱嵌入提升语言模型的事实性，适用于高精度要求的场景。

Abstract: Large language models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude have transformed natural
language processing (NLP) tasks such as question answering, dialogue
generation, summarization, and so forth; yet their susceptibility to
hallucination stands as one of the major challenges. Among numerous approaches
to overcome this challenge, integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language
models has emerged as a promising solution as it provides structured, reliable,
domain-specific, and up-to-date external information to the language models. In
this paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to
improve language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the
latent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual
information is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to
align entity and text embeddings. This alignment enables the language model to
distinguish between similar entities improving factual grounding and reducing
hallucination. We tested our approach on three popular questions-answering
benchmark datasets alongside language models of varying sizes, showing
significant improvement. Furthermore, we applied our approach to a real-world
financial use case from a large central bank in Europe, which demands high
accuracy and precision, demonstrating a substantial improvement of the LLM
answers.

Motivation: 研究LLM对权威信息来源的信任倾向及其潜在安全漏洞。

Method: 设计PSA方法，通过合成攻击或防御论文内容构造对抗提示，嵌入有害查询作为攻击载荷。

Result: PSA在Claude3.5-Sonnet和Deepseek-R1上分别达到97%和98%的攻击成功率，并发现模型对不同类型论文的脆弱性差异。

Conclusion: PSA揭示了LLM的安全漏洞，为对抗方法和安全对齐提供了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The safety of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant research
attention. In this paper, we argue that previous empirical studies demonstrate
LLMs exhibit a propensity to trust information from authoritative sources, such
as academic papers, implying new possible vulnerabilities. To verify this
possibility, a preliminary analysis is designed to illustrate our two findings.
Based on this insight, a novel jailbreaking method, Paper Summary Attack
(\llmname{PSA}), is proposed. It systematically synthesizes content from either
attack-focused or defense-focused LLM safety paper to construct an adversarial
prompt template, while strategically infilling harmful query as adversarial
payloads within predefined subsections. Extensive experiments show significant
vulnerabilities not only in base LLMs, but also in state-of-the-art reasoning
model like Deepseek-R1. PSA achieves a 97\% attack success rate (ASR) on
well-aligned models like Claude3.5-Sonnet and an even higher 98\% ASR on
Deepseek-R1. More intriguingly, our work has further revealed diametrically
opposed vulnerability bias across different base models, and even between
different versions of the same model, when exposed to either attack-focused or
defense-focused papers. This phenomenon potentially indicates future research
clues for both adversarial methodologies and safety alignment.Code is available

Result: 探测方法在输入扰动下表现不稳定，且探测值与模型行为相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 需更谨慎地评估LLM价值探测方法并认识其局限性。

Abstract: There has been extensive research on assessing the value orientation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) as it can shape user experiences across demographic
groups. However, several challenges remain. First, while the Multiple Choice
Question (MCQ) setting has been shown to be vulnerable to perturbations, there
is no systematic comparison of probing methods for value probing. Second, it is
unclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and
reflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate
the robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely
used probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that
all methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations. We also
introduce two tasks studying whether the values are responsive to demographic
context, and how well they align with the models' behaviors in value-related
scenarios. We show that the demographic context has little effect on the
free-text generation, and the models' values only weakly correlate with their
preference for value-based actions. Our work highlights the need for a more
careful examination of LLM value probing and awareness of its limitations.

Abstract: Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language

family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing
the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is
pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual
and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of
multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement
learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs.
Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models,
including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly
outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human
evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and
make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and
applications.

Motivation: 解决现有级联方法在自由文本生成中因依赖精确文本匹配而无法可靠评估输出的问题。

Method: 提出Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC)，通过识别弱模型输出的代表性答案并评估其他响应的语义对齐程度，决定是否接受或升级到强模型。

Result: 在三个自由文本生成基准测试中，KiC达到GPT-4准确率的97.53%，同时平均减少28.81%的API成本，并在特定基准中超越GPT-4。

Conclusion: KiC是一种高效且成本优化的自由文本生成框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However,
high-performing models are typically accessible only via APIs, incurring
substantial inference costs. Cascade methods address this by initially
employing a cheaper model and escalating to a stronger one only when necessary.
Nevertheless, existing cascade approaches struggle to select a reliable
representative response and assess the overall reliability of free-form
outputs, as they rely on exact text matching. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC), a novel framework for cost-efficient
free-form text generation. KiC identifies the most representative answer among
multiple outputs from a weaker model and evaluates the semantic alignment of
other responses with it. Based on the degree of alignment, KiC determines
whether to accept the weaker model's output or escalate to a stronger model.
Experiments on three free-form text generation benchmarks show that KiC
achieves 97.53 percent of GPT-4's accuracy while reducing API costs by 28.81
percent on average, and even outperforms GPT-4 in a specific benchmark.

Result: 在多个长上下文对话任务中表现优异，显著加速推理。

Conclusion: LoopServe通过自适应方法有效提升多轮对话中LLM的效率。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large
language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation
histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing
computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide
efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either
compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on
fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and
unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,
we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework
for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two
main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the
prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the
attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value
compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient
cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new
benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query
positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to
existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide
range of long-context dialogue tasks.

Motivation: LLMs常反映训练数据中的性别和性取向偏见，导致对LGBTQIA+用户的边缘化输出，因此减少这些偏见至关重要。

Method: 使用WinoQueer基准评估LoRA和软提示调优两种PEFT技术，量化三种开源LLM的偏见，并通过微调QueerNews语料库减少偏见。

Result: LoRA（<0.1%额外参数）将偏见分数降低多达50点，中立性从0%提升至36%；软提示调优效果有限。

Conclusion: LoRA能以极低计算成本显著提升公平性，建议推广社区参与的PEFT、扩大LGBTQIA+语料库并完善评估体系。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently reproduce the gender- and
sexual-identity prejudices embedded in their training corpora, leading to
outputs that marginalize LGBTQIA+ users. Hence, reducing such biases is of
great importance. To achieve this, we evaluate two parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques - Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and soft-prompt
tuning - as lightweight alternatives to full-model fine-tuning for mitigating
such biases. Using the WinoQueer benchmark, we quantify bias in three
open-source LLMs and observe baseline bias scores reaching up to 98 (out of
100) across a range of queer identities defined by gender and/or sexual
orientation, where 50 would indicate neutrality. Fine-tuning with LoRA (< 0.1%
additional parameters) on a curated QueerNews corpus reduces those scores by up
to 50 points and raises neutrality from virtually 0% to as much as 36%.
Soft-prompt tuning (10 virtual tokens) delivers only marginal improvements.
These findings show that LoRA can deliver meaningful fairness gains with
minimal computation. We advocate broader adoption of community-informed PEFT,
the creation of larger queer-authored corpora, and richer evaluation suites
beyond WinoQueer, coupled with ongoing audits to keep LLMs inclusive.

Result: 多模态环境下VLMs的防御能力下降，三个因素均可独立触发越狱，且少量上下文示例即可诱导不当输出。

Conclusion: VLMs在多模态环境下存在复杂漏洞，需进一步研究防御机制。

Abstract: Language models are highly sensitive to prompt formulations - small changes
in input can drastically alter their output. This raises a critical question:
To what extent can prompt sensitivity be exploited to generate inapt content?
In this paper, we investigate how discrete components of prompt design
influence the generation of inappropriate content in Visual Language Models
(VLMs). Specifically, we analyze the impact of three key factors on successful
jailbreaks: (a) the inclusion of detailed visual information, (b) the presence
of adversarial examples, and (c) the use of positively framed beginning
phrases. Our findings reveal that while a VLM can reliably distinguish between
benign and harmful inputs in unimodal settings (text-only or image-only), this
ability significantly degrades in multimodal contexts. Each of the three
factors is independently capable of triggering a jailbreak, and we show that
even a small number of in-context examples (as few as three) can push the model
toward generating inappropriate outputs. Furthermore, we propose a framework
that utilizes a skip-connection between two internal layers of the VLM, which
substantially increases jailbreak success rates, even when using benign images.
Finally, we demonstrate that memes, often perceived as humorous or harmless,
can be as effective as toxic visuals in eliciting harmful content, underscoring
the subtle and complex vulnerabilities of VLMs.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased

Nonetheless, the use of LLMs in production remains challenging due to their
unpredictable nature and discrepancies that can exist between their desired
behavior and their actual model output. In this paper, we introduce a new tool,
InTraVisTo (Inside Transformer Visualisation Tool), designed to enable
researchers to investigate and trace the computational process that generates
each token in a Transformer-based LLM. InTraVisTo provides a visualization of
both the internal state of the Transformer model (by decoding token embeddings
at each layer of the model) and the information flow between the various
components across the different layers of the model (using a Sankey diagram).
With InTraVisTo, we aim to help researchers and practitioners better understand
the computations being performed within the Transformer model and thus to shed
some light on internal patterns and reasoning processes employed by LLMs.

explicitly for persuasion-to evaluate their persuasiveness on 707 political

Contrary to popular concerns, we show that the persuasive power of current and
near-future AI is likely to stem more from post-training and prompting
methods-which boosted persuasiveness by as much as 51% and 27%
respectively-than from personalization or increasing model scale. We further
show that these methods increased persuasion by exploiting LLMs' unique ability
to rapidly access and strategically deploy information and that, strikingly,
where they increased AI persuasiveness they also systematically decreased
factual accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in many Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging extensive pre-training and fine-tuning to
achieve high accuracy. However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly
positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the
accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are
more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice
Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect
prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We
first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to
human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering
response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring
knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this
approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our
findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and
opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP
applications.

Abstract: Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have
recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training
approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed
for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires
expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones.
A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain
primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode
higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes
tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them
for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded
curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly
applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist.
Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking
traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model
on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical
superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify
reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on
ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired
primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench.
Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3
transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the
industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad
expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable
interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.

Motivation: 随着LLM生成文本能力接近人类水平，研究转向通过语言学特征区分和分析人类与机器文本的差异。

Method: 选取8个领域、11种LLM生成的文本数据集，计算形态、句法、语义等语言学特征，结合采样策略和统计分析方法。

Result: 人类文本句法更简单、语义更多样；新模型生成的文本风格变异性降低，呈现同质化趋势。

Conclusion: 机器生成文本在风格上逐渐趋同，而人类文本仍保持更高的多样性。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by
LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent
research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either
human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing
these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic
levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of
human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11
different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency
length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and
machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition
controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that
human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more
diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set
of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show
stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in
our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability
among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output
text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of
machine-generated texts.

Abstract: Integrating large language models into specialized domains like healthcare
presents unique challenges, including domain adaptation and limited labeled
data. We introduce CU-ICU, a method for customizing unsupervised
instruction-finetuned language models for ICU datasets by leveraging the
Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture. CU-ICU employs a sparse
fine-tuning approach that combines few-shot prompting with selective parameter
updates, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal supervision. Our evaluation
across critical ICU tasks--early sepsis detection, mortality prediction, and
clinical note generation--demonstrates that CU-ICU consistently improves
predictive accuracy and interpretability over standard fine-tuning methods.
Notably, CU-ICU achieves up to a 15% increase in sepsis detection accuracy and
a 20% enhancement in generating clinically relevant explanations while updating
fewer than 1% of model parameters in its most efficient configuration. These
results establish CU-ICU as a scalable, low-overhead solution for delivering
accurate and interpretable clinical decision support in real-world ICU

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
grounding large language models with external structured knowledge. However,
existing Graph RAG methods struggle with temporal reasoning, due to their
inability to model the evolving structure and order of real-world events. In
this work, we introduce DyG-RAG, a novel event-centric dynamic graph
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to capture and reason over
temporal knowledge embedded in unstructured text. To eliminate temporal
ambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units
(DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal
anchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture
temporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event
graph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting
efficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent
generation, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that
retrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time
Chain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This
unified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event
sequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG
systems cannot resolve. Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DyG-RAG significantly improves the accuracy and recall of
three typical types of temporal reasoning questions, paving the way for more
faithful and temporal-aware generation. DyG-RAG is available at

Conclusion: KG方法优于纯内容方法，ER模型微调是关键。

Abstract: When deciding to read an article or incorporate it into their research,
scholars often seek to quickly identify and understand its main ideas. In this
paper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific
articles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct
approaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient
paragraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking
these questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and
subsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content
of the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires
comparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach
leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by
fine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles
and using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction
method to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as
the centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure
assesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article
compared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs
using both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
through a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions
and answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively
captures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings
indicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is
crucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents.

Motivation: 生物医学文献的专业性使其难以被患者和护理人员理解，LLMs的潜在应用需要严格评估以避免潜在危害。

Method: 通过PLABA track的两个任务（完整改写和术语替换）评估多种模型，包括自动和人工评估。

Result: LLMs在事实准确性和完整性上表现优异，但在简洁性和术语识别上仍有不足，自动评估工具效果不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在生物医学文献改写中具有潜力，但需改进简洁性和评估工具。

Abstract: Objective: Recent advances in language models have shown potential to adapt
professional-facing biomedical literature to plain language, making it
accessible to patients and caregivers. However, their unpredictability,
combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous
evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research
and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.
  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts
(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included
complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as
identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of
Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.
Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation
from biomedical experts.
  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,
with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In
manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of
factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,
reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.
In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying
how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems
did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not
in brevity.
  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to
adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting
their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being implemented as joint

In this paper, we evaluate these recommendations and explanations by comparing
them to social choice-based aggregation strategies. Our results indicate that
LLM-generated recommendations often resembled those produced by Additive
Utilitarian (ADD) aggregation. However, the explanations typically referred to
averaging ratings (resembling but not identical to ADD aggregation). Group
structure, uniform or divergent, did not impact the recommendations.
Furthermore, LLMs regularly claimed additional criteria such as user or item
similarity, diversity, or used undefined popularity metrics or thresholds. Our
findings have important implications for LLMs in the GRS pipeline as well as
standard aggregation strategies. Additional criteria in explanations were
dependent on the number of ratings in the group scenario, indicating potential
inefficiency of standard aggregation methods at larger item set sizes.
Additionally, inconsistent and ambiguous explanations undermine transparency
and explainability, which are key motivations behind the use of LLMs for GRS.

Abstract: As AI systems take on collaborative roles, they must reason about shared

(RSA) framework offers a principled approach to pragmatic reasoning, but
existing extensions face challenges in scaling to multi-turn, collaborative
scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Collaborative Rational Speech Act
(CRSA), an information-theoretic (IT) extension of RSA that models multi-turn
dialog by optimizing a gain function adapted from rate-distortion theory. This
gain is an extension of the gain model that is maximized in the original RSA
model but takes into account the scenario in which both agents in a
conversation have private information and produce utterances conditioned on the
dialog. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRSA on referential games and
template-based doctor-patient dialogs in the medical domain. Empirical results
show that CRSA yields more consistent, interpretable, and collaborative
behavior than existing baselines-paving the way for more pragmatic and socially

Abstract: In the field of emotion recognition, the development of high-performance

individual personality traits, socio-cultural backgrounds, and contextual
factors, making large-scale, generalizable data collection both ethically and
practically difficult. To address this issue, we introduce PersonaGen, a novel
framework for generating emotionally rich text using a Large Language Model

layered virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural
backgrounds, and detailed situational contexts, which are then used to guide
emotion expression generation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the
generated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and
distributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism
through comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in
downstream emotion classification tasks. Experimental results show that
PersonaGen significantly outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse,

components: (1) a style detector based on contextual embeddings that identifies
stylistic disparities between source and target texts, and (2) a
diffusion-based style applicator that rectifies stylistic inconsistencies while
maintaining semantic integrity. Our framework integrates with existing NMT
systems as a post-processing module, enabling style-aware translation without
requiring architectural modifications or parallel stylistic data. Extensive
experiments on five diverse domains (law, literature, scientific writing,
medicine, and educational content) demonstrate Babel's effectiveness: it
identifies stylistic inconsistencies with 88.21% precision and improves
stylistic preservation by 150% while maintaining a high semantic similarity
score of 0.92. Human evaluation confirms that translations refined by Babel
better preserve source text style while maintaining fluency and adequacy.

Conclusion: 研究为句法计算的神经实现提供了理论支持，并揭示了Merge与算术后继函数的相似性。

Abstract: We provide a mathematical argument showing that, given a representation of
lexical items as functions (wavelets, for instance) in some function space, it
is possible to construct a faithful representation of arbitrary syntactic
objects in the same function space. This space can be endowed with a
commutative non-associative semiring structure built using the second Renyi
entropy. The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with
the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an
operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the
input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure.
The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these
circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results
obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical
possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational
structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general
construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross
frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge
can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus
clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor
function of arithmetic.

Result: 专家模型（基于个体法官历史裁决）比通用模型（基于聚合数据）预测准确率更高（F1分数92.85% vs 82.63%）。

Conclusion: 司法身份对法律结果有可测量的影响，支持法律现实主义。

Abstract: This study examines the role of human judges in legal decision-making by
using machine learning to predict child physical custody outcomes in French
appellate courts. Building on the legal realism-formalism debate, we test
whether individual judges' decision-making patterns significantly influence
case outcomes, challenging the assumption that judges are neutral variables
that apply the law uniformly. To ensure compliance with French privacy laws, we
implement a strict pseudonymization process. Our analysis uses 18,937 living
arrangements rulings extracted from 10,306 cases. We compare models trained on
individual judges' past rulings (specialist models) with a judge-agnostic model
trained on aggregated data (generalist models). The prediction pipeline is a
hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) for structured feature
extraction and ML models for outcome prediction (RF, XGB and SVC). Our results
show that specialist models consistently achieve higher predictive accuracy
than the general model, with top-performing models reaching F1 scores as high
as 92.85%, compared to the generalist model's 82.63% trained on 20x to 100x
more samples. Specialist models capture stable individual patterns that are not
transferable to other judges. In-Domain and Cross-Domain validity tests provide
empirical support for legal realism, demonstrating that judicial identity plays
a measurable role in legal outcomes. All data and code used will be made
available.

Conclusion: GSDMM+在短文本聚类中表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: Short text clustering has become increasingly important with the popularity
of social media like Twitter, Google+, and Facebook. Existing methods can be
broadly categorized into two paradigms: topic model-based approaches and deep
representation learning-based approaches. This task is inherently challenging
due to the sparse, large-scale, and high-dimensional characteristics of the
short text data. Furthermore, the computational intensity required by
representation learning significantly increases the running time. To address
these issues, we propose a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet
Multinomial Mixture model (GSDMM), which effectively handles the sparsity and
high dimensionality of short texts while identifying representative words for
each cluster. Based on several aspects of GSDMM that warrant further
refinement, we propose an improved approach, GSDMM+, designed to further
optimize its performance. GSDMM+ reduces initialization noise and adaptively
adjusts word weights based on entropy, achieving fine-grained clustering that
reveals more topic-related information. Additionally, strategic cluster merging
is employed to refine clustering granularity, better aligning the predicted
distribution with the true category distribution. We conduct extensive
experiments, comparing our methods with both classical and state-of-the-art
approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of our methods. The source code for our model is publicly

Motivation: 研究侦探小说中的公平性（fair play）及其在LLM生成故事中的应用，以评估和改进LLM的故事创作能力。

Result: LLM生成的故事虽不可预测，但未能平衡惊喜与公平性，导致质量较差。

Conclusion: LLM在故事创作中需进一步优化以平衡惊喜与公平性。

Abstract: Effective storytelling relies on a delicate balance between meeting the
reader's prior expectations and introducing unexpected developments. In the
domain of detective fiction, this tension is known as fair play, which includes
the implicit agreement between the writer and the reader as to the range of
possible resolutions the mystery story may have. In this work, we present a
probabilistic framework for detective fiction that allows us to define desired
qualities. Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design
appropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent
tension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes
sense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it
to LLM-generated detective stories. This domain is appealing since we have an
abundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story,
and the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right.
Results show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they
generally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which
greatly contributes to their poor quality.

Abstract: Academic programs are increasingly recognizing the importance of personal and
professional skills and their critical role alongside technical expertise in
preparing students for future success in diverse career paths. With this
growing demand comes the need for scalable systems to measure, evaluate, and
develop these skills. Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) offer one potential
avenue for measuring these skills in a standardized and reliable way, but
open-response SJTs have traditionally relied on trained human raters for
evaluation, presenting operational challenges to delivering SJTs at scale. Past
attempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due
to issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore
a novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses
using large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the
efficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future
developments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.

Abstract: Despite Arabic being one of the most widely spoken languages, the development
of Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems faces significant
challenges due to the language's complexity, and only a limited number of
public Arabic ASR models exist. While much of the focus has been on Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), there is considerably less attention given to the
variations within the language. This paper introduces a universal methodology
for Arabic speech and text processing designed to address unique challenges of
the language. Using this methodology, we train two novel models based on the
FastConformer architecture: one designed specifically for MSA and the other,
the first unified public model for both MSA and Classical Arabic (CA). The MSA
model sets a new benchmark with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on related
datasets, while the unified model achieves SOTA accuracy with diacritics for CA
while maintaining strong performance for MSA. To promote reproducibility, we
open-source the models and their training recipes.

Abstract: This study proposes the Cognitive Pairwise Comparison Classification Model

based on expert knowledge judgment, is used to calculate the weights of
evaluation criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,
specificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa (Kappa), and
efficiency. Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (ALBERT) are chosen as classification baseline models. A weighted
decision matrix consisting of classification evaluation scores with respect to
criteria weights, is formed to select the best classification model for a
classification problem. Three open datasets of social media are used to
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CPC-CMS. Based on our simulation,
for evaluation results excluding the time factor, ALBERT is the best for the
three datasets; if time consumption is included, no single model always
performs better than the other models. The CPC-CMS can be applied to the other
classification applications in different areas.

Abstract: Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an
Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a
patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their
importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For
instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III
(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress
notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the
dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different
aspects of care.
  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered
Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by
simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress
notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal
alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into
structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically
informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant
content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to
prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and
temporally aware progress notes.
  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and
complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong
longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,
surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative
coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved
downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical
decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in
real-world healthcare settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to address
the data scarcity challenge in robotics, enabling the development of
generalizable visuomotor control policies. While models like OpenVLA showcase
the potential of this paradigm, deploying large-scale VLMs on
resource-constrained mobile manipulation systems remains a significant hurdle.
This paper introduces Edge VLA (EVLA), a novel approach designed to
significantly enhance the inference speed of Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models. EVLA maintains the representational power of these models while
enabling real-time performance on edge devices. We achieve this through two key
innovations: 1) Eliminating the autoregressive requirement for end-effector
position prediction, leading to a 7x speedup in inference, and 2) Leveraging
the efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs), demonstrating comparable
training performance to larger models with significantly reduced computational
demands. Our early results demonstrate that EVLA achieves comparable training
characteristics to OpenVLA while offering substantial gains in inference speed
and memory efficiency. We release our model checkpoints and training

relying completely on the original dataset. We propose a contextual graph-based

appropriate schema, so we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
to transform news articles into contextual graph structures. We then apply the
Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based Graph-Based Anomaly Detection (GBAD)
algorithm for graph mining. Graph-based methods are particularly effective for
handling rich contextual data, as they enable the discovery of complex patterns
that traditional query-based or statistical techniques might overlook. Our
proposed approach identifies normative patterns within the dataset and
subsequently uncovers anomalous patterns that deviate from these established
norms.

Abstract: Formal thought disorder (FTD), a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum
disorders, manifests as incoherent speech and poses challenges for clinical
assessment. Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are
resource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with
automatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of
linguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The
use of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought
to reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the
utility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity
requires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic
coherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries
(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream
narratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside
established coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to
predict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone
robustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic
coherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only
models, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to
\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best
\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance
gains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all
contexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These
findings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses
provide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and
advance automated speech analysis in psychosis.

frequency of first-person singular pronouns did not vary significantly with the
clients' psychological conditions. These outcomes are discussed within the

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过合成数据、拼接单语音频和利用真实语码转换数据改进加泰罗尼亚语-西班牙语语码转换的自动语音识别（ASR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语码转换（CS）在现实世界中普遍存在，但缺乏专用数据集限制了ASR性能，尤其是在多语言社会中。

Method: 采用三种策略：生成合成CS数据、拼接单语音频、利用真实CS数据加语言标记，并微调Whisper模型。

Result: 结合少量合成CS数据和主导语言标记的模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 合成数据与语言标记结合是提升CS-ASR的有效方法。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternating use of two or more languages, challenges
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to scarce training data and linguistic
similarities. The lack of dedicated CS datasets limits ASR performance, as most
models rely on monolingual or mixed-language corpora that fail to reflect
real-world CS patterns. This issue is critical in multilingual societies where
CS occurs in informal and formal settings. A key example is Catalan-Spanish CS,
widely used in media and parliamentary speeches. In this work, we improve ASR
for Catalan-Spanish CS by exploring three strategies: (1) generating synthetic
CS data, (2) concatenating monolingual audio, and (3) leveraging real CS data
with language tokens. We extract CS data from Catalan speech corpora and
fine-tune OpenAI's Whisper models, making them available on Hugging Face.
Results show that combining a modest amount of synthetic CS data with the
dominant language token yields the best transcription performance.

Motivation: 现有体积可视化方法依赖复杂预定义规则且风格迁移受限，TexGS-VolVis旨在解决这些问题。

Result: TexGS-VolVis在效率、视觉质量和编辑灵活性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TexGS-VolVis为体积可视化提供了高质量、灵活的风格迁移和编辑能力。

Abstract: Advancements in volume visualization (VolVis) focus on extracting insights
from 3D volumetric data by generating visually compelling renderings that
reveal complex internal structures. Existing VolVis approaches have explored
non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness,
and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods
often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single
style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we
advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian
primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style
transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives
tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization
results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian
splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives,
extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes,
resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced
lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving
flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance
stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing
tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing
with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and
quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its
superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and
editing flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Vision Mamba的效率以扩展其应用，但现有ViT的token缩减技术直接应用于Mamba会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Mamba结构感知的重要性评分，并基于此设计训练无关的MTR框架。

Result: MTR在Vim-B骨干上减少约40% FLOPs，ImageNet性能仅下降1.6%。

Conclusion: MTR是一种高效且通用的Vision Mamba token缩减方法。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)
due to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear
computational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression
technique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision
Mamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we
find that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to
Vision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily
because Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most
token reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance
measurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we
investigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token
importance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further
propose MTR, a training-free \textbf{M}amba \textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction
framework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our
method can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various
Mamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across
various tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by
approximately 40\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\% drop in ImageNet
performance without retraining.

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型缺乏细粒度对象级理解的链式推理能力，CoTasks旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出CoTasks框架，将复杂视频问题分解为帧定位、实体跟踪、时空关系提取等四个任务，并嵌入中间推理步骤。

Result: 在NeXT-QA基准测试中，LLaVA-video-7B和Qwen2.5-VL-3B的性能分别提升了3.3和17.4分。

Conclusion: CoTasks作为一种结构化监督框架，有效提升了视频推理能力。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key
open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding.
Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are
trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations
necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks:
Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that
decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR)
into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking,
spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate
CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly
perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA
benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance:
LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and
Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal
(+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for
improving compositional video reasoning.

Motivation: Vision Mamba模型在医学图像处理中表现出色，但其将2D图像序列化为1D的设计依赖于扫描顺序，而这一选择在医学图像（如MRI）中尤为重要，因为其包含强解剖学先验。本文旨在系统研究扫描顺序对MRI分割的影响。

Method: 提出Multi-Scan 2D (MS2D)模块，支持多种扫描路径的探索，无需额外计算成本。在三个公共数据集（BraTS 2020, ISLES 2022, LGG）上对21种扫描策略进行了大规模基准测试。

Result: 扫描顺序对性能有显著影响（Friedman检验：χ²₂₀=43.9, p=0.0016），性能差异高达27 Dice点。空间连续的扫描路径（如水平和垂直光栅）表现优于非连续路径。

Conclusion: 扫描顺序是一个无需额外成本的高效超参数，本文提供了基于证据的最优路径选择建议，以提升Mamba模型在医学图像中的性能。

Abstract: Vision Mamba models promise transformer-level performance at linear
computational cost, but their reliance on serializing 2D images into 1D
sequences introduces a critical, yet overlooked, design choice: the patch scan
order. In medical imaging, where modalities like brain MRI contain strong
anatomical priors, this choice is non-trivial. This paper presents the first
systematic study of how scan order impacts MRI segmentation. We introduce
Multi-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures
that facilitates exploring diverse scan paths without additional computational
cost. We conduct a large-scale benchmark of 21 scan strategies on three public
datasets (BraTS 2020, ISLES 2022, LGG), covering over 70,000 slices. Our
analysis shows conclusively that scan order is a statistically significant
factor (Friedman test: $\chi^{2}_{20}=43.9, p=0.0016$), with performance
varying by as much as 27 Dice points. Spatially contiguous paths -- simple
horizontal and vertical rasters -- consistently outperform disjointed diagonal
scans. We conclude that scan order is a powerful, cost-free hyperparameter, and
provide an evidence-based shortlist of optimal paths to maximize the
performance of Mamba models in medical imaging.

Conclusion: 结构化提示和强化学习（GRPO）能有效提升VLM的空间推理能力和泛化性。

Abstract: This study investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement
learning. We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies
and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step
before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's
original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on
scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune
models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and
evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates
superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular,
we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade
performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther
from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable
performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how
reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open

Method: 引入多模态反事实查询数据集，通过logit检查定位控制冲突的注意力头，并修改这些头以引导模型行为。

Result: 定位到少量控制冲突的注意力头，修改这些头可引导模型偏向内部知识或视觉输入，且这些头的注意力定位优于基于梯度的归因方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs解决跨模态冲突的机制，为模型的可控性和可解释性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly leverage diverse knowledge sources
to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal
parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result
in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such
interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms
that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of
multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal
commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads
that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the
model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show
that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual
overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable

large-scale unlabeled data has raised significant safety and copyright
concerns. Efforts to address these issues by erasing unwanted concepts have
shown promise. However, many existing erasure methods involve excessive
modifications that compromise the overall utility of the model. In this work,
we address these issues by formulating a novel minimalist concept erasure
objective based \emph{only} on the distributional distance of final generation
outputs. Building on our formulation, we derive a tractable loss for
differentiable optimization that leverages backpropagation through all
generation steps in an end-to-end manner. We also conduct extensive analysis to
show theoretical connections with other models and methods. To improve the
robustness of the erasure, we incorporate neuron masking as an alternative to
model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art flow-matching
models demonstrate that our method robustly erases concepts without degrading
overall model performance, paving the way for safer and more responsible
generative models.

Result: 当前模型在这些任务中表现不佳，甚至接近随机准确率，远低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 尽管VLMs在原始视觉能力上有所提升，但缺乏核心的视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and
chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple
perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models'
capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining
evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We
isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which
demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic
search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate
successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly
along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude
Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior
primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy
on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured
evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual
algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual
acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image

control remains challenging. Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning
and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful
design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for
structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented
Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the
editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through
two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion
(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines
standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy
input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative
and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and
structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity
scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders
inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference
time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during
training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these
contributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion
models, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose,
in-context generative diffusion architectures.

Abstract: Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable
performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable
Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However,
real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and
fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay
methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine
retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced
synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a
frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique
visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,
confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by
post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most
representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them
by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with
existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay
fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning
(MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay
techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and
zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator
adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator,

Abstract: Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose
systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In
this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's
perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time
horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including
those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw
pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible
by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision
backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the
frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight,
task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we
introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties
directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine
models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging
representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video
understanding.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models
(FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by
offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for
enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale
skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We
propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and
a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves
state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,
replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of
frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers
with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation
studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve
competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for
continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real
world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.

Abstract: We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source
(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,
CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training
pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and
a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in
SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to
large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to
account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we
introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on
nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features
into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,
enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a
novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional
biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic
content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,
demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions
establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and
open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for
the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at

Abstract: Due to its extensive applications, aerial image object detection has long
been a hot topic in computer vision. In recent years, advancements in Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new
heights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,
traditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting
predefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The
advent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this
limitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can
identify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This
breakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in
aerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD
in the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles
of OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a
specialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic
taxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides
a comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review
enables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the
intersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline
promising future research directions and application prospects. This survey
aims to provide a clear road map and a valuable reference for both newcomers
and seasoned researchers, fostering innovation in this rapidly evolving domain.

Conclusion: InSyn和SSOS策略有效提升了行人轨迹预测的准确性，尤其在复杂交互场景中。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent
applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on
relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to
overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting
behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address
this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel
Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns
(e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling
direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training
strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue
of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on
the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent
baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the
SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance,
reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.

reasoning on challenging crowded images. Our results show that even the

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI and synthetic media, distinguishing
AI-generated images from real ones has become crucial in safeguarding against
misinformation and ensuring digital authenticity. Traditional watermarking
techniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their
effectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel
in-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable
concepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable
watermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or
perturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic
attributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to
adversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image
augmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of
watermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,
demonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining
image quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking
techniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce
IConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with
StegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against
multiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique
(IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9%
higher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
scores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on

Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving intention is key to enhancing the safety and
interactive efficiency of human-machine co-driving systems. It serves as a
cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current
approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex
spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human
driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal
Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between
driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction.
Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF)
mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature
streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically
eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and
an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these
purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate
the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal
spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of
driving intention prediction.

Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective

Abstract: Natural image quality is often degraded by adverse weather conditions,
significantly impairing the performance of downstream tasks. Image restoration
has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed
in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made
remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity
poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in
real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to
simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or
state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network
architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration
itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative
pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image
restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient
restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).
Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block
level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to
achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the
intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative
to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity
while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks
such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion
deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light
enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with
significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generating realistic and diverse visual content. A
critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret
textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative
expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly
descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach
tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:
poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.
Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that
is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage
prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of
poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion
models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent
self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then
collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research
in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting
of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a
panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both
human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and
contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced
information capture in the generated images.

Abstract: In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are
increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based
generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of
producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of
how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of
StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such
as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the
model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,
enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is
revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without
drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational
requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily
influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global
alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while
targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of
specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of
academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential
misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to
fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context
of digital deception and cybercrime.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely
limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn
new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a
text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that
FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting
from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale
representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To
maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple
complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight
support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our
framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal
trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.
Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that
Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on
previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.

Motivation: 解决现有文本到视频（T2V）模型在图像质量和运动表现上的不足，避免因帧间不一致导致的闪烁和伪影问题。

Conclusion: EVS通过结合T2I和T2V模型的优势，显著提升了视频生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered
considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual
descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion
representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing
approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video
frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to
inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free
Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both
visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach
utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video
frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing
them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to
ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior
into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of
both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion
quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach
compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a
significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:

Abstract: In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous
questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits.
Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions.
These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions
with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However,
research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1)
Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities
through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than
asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three
common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA
scenarios.

Abstract: Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image
classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency
are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this
study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through
a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and
computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis
but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and
propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction
approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,
diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the
discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image
descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and
edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an
image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is
used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid
search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,
including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers
competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.
Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a
compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive
and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of
entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight
and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image
classification and computer vision.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)
enhance the model performance by exploiting information from labeled and
unlabeled data. The clustering assumption has proven advantageous for learning
with limited supervision and states that data points belonging to the same
cluster in a high-dimensional space should be assigned to the same category.
Recent works have utilized different training mechanisms to implicitly enforce
this assumption for the SSL and UDA. In this work, we take a different approach
by explicitly involving a differentiable clustering module which is extended to
leverage the supervised data to compute its centroids. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our straightforward end-to-end training strategy for SSL and
UDA over extensive experiments and highlight its benefits, especially in low
supervision regimes, both as a standalone model and as a regularizer for
existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that
follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their
supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,
edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect
only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical
plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated
edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an
automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,
resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative
models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned
Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,
removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and
compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,
enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most
repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training
without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this
resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k
high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses
all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source

Result: 在SPAWC2021和USC-HAD数据集上表现优异，错误率更低，F1和OA显著提升，参数训练量极低。

Conclusion: GRAM-MAMBA在资源受限环境中实现了高效且鲁棒的多模态感知。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely
deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and
healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model
complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,
unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and
robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient
and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the
linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,
combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among
modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality
alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive
low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities
post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant
adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the
fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On
the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower
error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance
boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity
recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),
outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while
training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's
potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly
advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental
monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches
generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data
modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization.
Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised
learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating
the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated
semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present
SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to
handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL
strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2
incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality
prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited
feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture

model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an
extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for
enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable
geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR
data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized
in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited
expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative
capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted
by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to
enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we
propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature
extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global
semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.
To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a
bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local
cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method
consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of
incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object
detection.

Abstract: Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video
remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and
blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce
DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit
static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static
token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing
static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates
three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a
time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing
static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention
that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens
frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual
static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using
swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms
state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest
swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic
transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized neuroimage analysis by delivering
unprecedented speed and accuracy. However, the narrow scope of many training
datasets constrains model robustness and generalizability. This challenge is
particularly acute in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where image appearance
varies widely across pulse sequences and scanner hardware. A recent
domain-randomization strategy addresses the generalization problem by training
deep neural networks on synthetic images with randomized intensities and
anatomical content. By generating diverse data from anatomical segmentation
maps, the approach enables models to accurately process image types unseen
during training, without retraining or fine-tuning. It has demonstrated
effectiveness across modalities including MRI, computed tomography, positron
emission tomography, and optical coherence tomography, as well as beyond
neuroimaging in ultrasound, electron and fluorescence microscopy, and X-ray
microtomography. This tutorial paper reviews the principles, implementation,
and potential of the synthesis-driven training paradigm. It highlights key
benefits, such as improved generalization and resistance to overfitting, while
discussing trade-offs such as increased computational demands. Finally, the
article explores practical considerations for adopting the technique, aiming to
accelerate the development of generalizable tools that make deep learning more

Abstract: Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style
decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and
stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in
visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the
decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion
models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a
promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving
performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore
VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation
process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel
method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating
optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their
respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method
to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented
Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark
this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for
content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various
artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior
approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token
selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable.
We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable
watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination.
Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining
localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention
patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An
entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and
semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty
generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than
conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework
demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and
synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing
new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking

neural barrier function and a safe controller using limited labelled data,
while exploiting the predictive power of modern vision transformers for latent

Abstract: Modern 3D object detection datasets are constrained by narrow class
taxonomies and costly manual annotations, limiting their ability to scale to
open-world settings. In contrast, 2D vision-language models trained on
web-scale image-text pairs exhibit rich semantic understanding and support
open-vocabulary detection via natural language prompts. In this work, we
leverage the maturity and category diversity of 2D foundation models to perform
open-vocabulary 3D object detection without any human-annotated 3D labels.
  Our pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector to generate text-conditioned
proposals, which are segmented with SAM and back-projected into 3D using camera
geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth. We introduce a geometric
inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D
bounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we
construct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes
dataset.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization
performance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D
inputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary. Our results

Abstract: Hierarchical feature representations play a pivotal role in computer vision,
particularly in object detection for autonomous driving. Multi-level semantic
understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and
traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as
YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales
while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address
these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework
designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving
detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations:
Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which
refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency
filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive
Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively
integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen
hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI,
and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation
capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while
reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and
integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that
achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational
efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and

Abstract: Industrial defect detection is vital for upholding product quality across
contemporary manufacturing systems. As the expectations for precision,
automation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are
increasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress
in computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect
detection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant
development has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection
frameworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and
facilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a
cohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains
elusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both
closed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D
modalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the
rising prominence of open-set techniques. We distill critical challenges
inherent in practical detection environments and illuminate emerging trends,
thereby providing a current and comprehensive vista of this swiftly progressing

Abstract: A large variety of geospatial data layers is available around the world
ranging from remotely-sensed raster data like satellite imagery, digital
elevation models, predicted land cover maps, and human-annotated data, to data
derived from environmental sensors such as air temperature or wind speed data.
A large majority of machine learning models trained on satellite imagery
(SatML), however, are designed primarily for optical input modalities such as
multi-spectral satellite imagery. To better understand the value of using other
input modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we
generate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional
geographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and
segmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional
geographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model
performance. Benefits are largest in settings where labeled data are limited
and in geographic out-of-sample settings, suggesting that multi-modal inputs
may be especially valuable for data-efficiency and out-of-sample performance of
SatML models. Surprisingly, we find that hard-coded fusion strategies
outperform learned variants, with interesting implications for future work.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the surrounding environment is essential for safe
autonomous driving. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates detailed 3D
structures of roads, buildings, and other objects, is particularly important
for vision-centric autonomous driving systems that do not rely on LiDAR
sensors. However, in 3D semantic occupancy prediction -- where each voxel is
assigned a semantic label -- annotated LiDAR point clouds are required, making
data acquisition costly. In contrast, large-scale binary occupancy data, which
only indicate occupied or free space without semantic labels, can be collected
at a lower cost. Despite their availability, the potential of leveraging such
data remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the utilization of
large-scale binary occupancy data from two perspectives: (1) pre-training and
(2) learning-based auto-labeling. We propose a novel binary occupancy-based
framework that decomposes the prediction process into binary and semantic
occupancy modules, enabling effective use of binary occupancy data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing methods in both pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, highlighting its
effectiveness in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction. The code is

Abstract: Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis,
preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as
it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow
velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction
methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual
intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes,
they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces
suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce
AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces
directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided
conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines
conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then
automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour,
ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are
fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh
representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods,
including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets,
and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric
fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively
even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and
pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or
coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality
visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for
cardiovascular research.

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by
one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we
improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of
archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in
the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same
sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using
CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad,
central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising.
First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased
sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image
segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in
detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model
allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest
(confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by
archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of
using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover
archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with
significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing
archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

Result: 在多种公开数据集上验证，方法优于现有方法，实现了高边界率且未高估不确定性。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for
providing per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne
LiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the
accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it
relies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).
Generally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a
two-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),
followed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM
stage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the
reprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and
non-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal
nature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an
uncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error
covariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry
process. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose
a novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)
per-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such
as matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,
our method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the
MVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering
to error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a
robust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We
evaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV
imagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.

Abstract: Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is
difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is
a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches
rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to
sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based
framework, dubbed \ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying
texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \ours performs DM to generate
the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To
implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a
memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for
DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the
Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel
Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes
spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we
implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture
details. Extensive evaluations show that \ours provides a promising
unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used
benchmarks.

Abstract: Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is
essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding
in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which
struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving
camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion
Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of
integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus
of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood
from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a
segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method
effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational
camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016
dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to
generate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole
usage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of
hybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF
representation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar
generation qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their
deformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the
deformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational
costs on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points
are located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but
result in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we
propose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel
efficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In
EPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray
omission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that
progress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval
on the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.
The delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB图像在3D HOI任务中因几何模糊和严重遮挡导致的姿态估计困难。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MaskHOI通过几何感知和遮挡鲁棒性学习，有效提升了3D HOI姿态估计性能。

Abstract: In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of
hands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to
the inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions
that occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,
a novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI
pose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction
strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and
structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and
occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our
observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than
rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the
reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the
region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking
guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions
than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the
latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire
fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world
interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained
encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven
multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the
learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and
objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of
monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

Method: 提出HeCoFuse框架，采用分层融合机制（通道和空间注意力）和自适应空间分辨率调整模块，并结合动态调整融合类型的协作学习策略。

Conclusion: HeCoFuse在异构传感器配置下表现出色，成为TUM-Traf V2X数据集上的最新技术。

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often
operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and
deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity
poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To
address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for
cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras
(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that
adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial
attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality
feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an
adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance
computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across
different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments
on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%
3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D
baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC
scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine
heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our
first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the
current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust
performance across diverse sensor deployments.

Conclusion: 提出的准度量方法为MOT评估提供了更灵活的工具，适用于特定应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of
multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an
extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and
measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an
extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy
between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these
quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected
objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The
T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the
GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of
penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation
costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT
evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT
algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.

Result: DynFaceRestore在定量和定性评估中均达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了保真度和细节质量，提升了盲脸恢复的鲁棒性和效果。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial
images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in
preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been
increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing
methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance
scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect
degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,
resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose
DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any
blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry
images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the
starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during
the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce
a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across
local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving
structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the
trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations,
demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.

Conclusion: CF-SSC通过时空建模和未来帧预测，显著提升了3D场景完成能力。

Abstract: In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a
critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer
complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in
real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains
occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that
existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC
framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's
effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish
accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past,
present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods
that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more
robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.
Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our
approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and
3D scene completion accuracy.

Conclusion: Depth3DLane通过自监督深度估计和双路径设计，实现了高效且广泛适用的3D车道检测。

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is essential for autonomous driving, but
challenging due to the inherent lack of explicit spatial information.
Multi-modal approaches rely on expensive depth sensors, while methods
incorporating fully-supervised depth networks rely on ground-truth depth data
that is impractical to collect at scale. Additionally, existing methods assume
that camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios
like crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these
limitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that
integrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit
structural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional
ground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a
point cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts
explicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously
extracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to
sample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a
per-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to
enhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark
dataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters
instead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in
scenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.

Conclusion: PCR-GS通过双重视角正则化，有效提升了复杂场景下的3D-GS性能。

Abstract: COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing
attention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D
scenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle
scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and
translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of
camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and
3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that
achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose
co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The
first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO
features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for
camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency
regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further
optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over
multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior
pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.

Abstract: We present TimeNeRF, a generalizable neural rendering approach for rendering
novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and at arbitrary times, even with few input
views. For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views
and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital
realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive
experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition
between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing
novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling
remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this
end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance
fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our
model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us
to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and
further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.
Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.
Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting
without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic
novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing
intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.

quantifies regularity within the framework of microlocal spaces introduced by
Jaffard. The central tool in our analysis is the fast samplet transform, a
distributional wavelet transform tailored to scattered data. We establish a
connection between the decay of samplet coefficients and the pointwise
regularity of multivariate signals. As a by product, we derive decay estimates
for functions belonging to classical H\"older spaces and Sobolev-Slobodeckij
spaces. While traditional wavelets are effective for regularity detection in
low-dimensional structured data, samplets demonstrate robust performance even
for higher dimensional and scattered data. To illustrate our theoretical
findings, we present extensive numerical studies detecting local regularity of
one-, two- and three-dimensional signals, ranging from non-uniformly sampled
time series over image segmentation to edge detection in point clouds.

latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a

QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior
reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance
videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of
sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of
anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,
including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the
UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,
BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method
responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate
that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on
the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain
anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models
inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the
strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.
These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization
and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining
detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization
techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often
overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.
Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a

and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r
equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen
kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59).
These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level
Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres,
suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in
clinical workflows.

Conclusion: Cardiff通过级联去噪实现了高保真轨迹生成，并灵活平衡隐私保护与数据效用。

Abstract: Urban mobility data has significant connections with economic growth and
plays an essential role in various smart-city applications. However, due to
privacy concerns and substantial data collection costs, fine-grained human
mobility trajectories are difficult to become publicly available on a large
scale. A promising solution to address this issue is trajectory synthesizing.
However, existing works often ignore the inherent structural complexity of
trajectories, unable to handle complicated high-dimensional distributions and
generate realistic fine-grained trajectories. In this paper, we propose
Cardiff, a coarse-to-fine Cascaded hybrid diffusion-based trajectory
synthesizing framework for fine-grained and privacy-preserving mobility
generation. By leveraging the hierarchical nature of urban mobility, Cardiff
decomposes the generation process into two distinct levels, i.e., discrete road
segment-level and continuous fine-grained GPS-level: (i) In the segment-level,
to reduce computational costs and redundancy in raw trajectories, we first
encode the discrete road segments into low-dimensional latent embeddings and
design a diffusion transformer-based latent denoising network for segment-level
trajectory synthesis. (ii) Taking the first stage of generation as conditions,
we then design a fine-grained GPS-level conditional denoising network with a
noise augmentation mechanism to achieve robust and high-fidelity generation.
Additionally, the Cardiff framework not only progressively generates
high-fidelity trajectories through cascaded denoising but also flexibly enables
a tunable balance between privacy preservation and utility. Experimental
results on three large real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics.

Conclusion: D2IP在动态肺部成像中具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Unsupervised learning methods, such as Deep Image Prior (DIP), have shown
great potential in tomographic imaging due to their training-data-free nature
and high generalization capability. However, their reliance on numerous network
parameter iterations results in high computational costs, limiting their
practical application, particularly in complex 3D or time-sequence tomographic
imaging tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose Deep Dynamic Image
Prior (D2IP), a novel framework for 3D time-sequence imaging. D2IP introduces
three key strategies - Unsupervised Parameter Warm-Start (UPWS), Temporal
Parameter Propagation (TPP), and a customized lightweight reconstruction
backbone, 3D-FastResUNet - to accelerate convergence, enforce temporal
coherence, and improve computational efficiency. Experimental results on both
simulated and clinical pulmonary datasets demonstrate that D2IP enables fast
and accurate 3D time-sequence Electrical Impedance Tomography (tsEIT)
reconstruction. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, D2IP delivers superior
image quality, with a 24.8% increase in average MSSIM and an 8.1% reduction in
ERR, alongside significantly reduced computational time (7.1x faster),
highlighting its promise for clinical dynamic pulmonary imaging.

Conclusion: 通过结合模糊核和缩放因子，并利用参考图像，该方法显著提升了盲超分辨率任务的性能。

Abstract: Previous studies in blind super-resolution (BSR) have primarily concentrated
on estimating degradation kernels directly from low-resolution (LR) inputs to
enhance super-resolution. However, these degradation kernels, which model the
transition from a high-resolution (HR) image to its LR version, should account
for not only the degradation process but also the downscaling factor. Applying
the same degradation kernel across varying super-resolution scales may be
impractical. Our research acknowledges degradation kernels and scaling factors
as pivotal elements for the BSR task and introduces a novel strategy that
utilizes HR images as references to establish scale-aware degradation kernels.
By employing content-irrelevant HR reference images alongside the target LR
image, our model adaptively discerns the degradation process. It is then
applied to generate additional LR-HR pairs through down-sampling the HR
reference images, which are keys to improving the SR performance. Our
reference-based training procedure is applicable to proficiently trained blind
SR models and zero-shot blind SR methods, consistently outperforming previous
methods in both scenarios. This dual consideration of blur kernels and scaling
factors, coupled with the use of a reference image, contributes to the
effectiveness of our approach in blind super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Accurate classification of computed tomography (CT) images is essential for
diagnosis and treatment planning, but existing methods often struggle with the
subtle and spatially diverse nature of pathological features. Current
approaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect
localized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an
uncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a
global-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity
and then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach
employs evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding
the extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression
mechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement
strategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate
both contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three
CT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for
kidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our
analysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial
benefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive
learning pipeline is implemented. Our code is available at:

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for low-light image
enhancement, named the Encoder-Decoder Network with Illumination Guidance
(EDNIG). Building upon the U-Net architecture, EDNIG integrates an illumination
map, derived from Bright Channel Prior (BCP), as a guidance input. This
illumination guidance helps the network focus on underexposed regions,
effectively steering the enhancement process. To further improve the model's
representational power, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is incorporated
to extract multi-scale contextual features, enabling better handling of diverse
lighting conditions. Additionally, the Swish activation function is employed to
ensure smoother gradient propagation during training. EDNIG is optimized within
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework using a composite loss
function that combines adversarial loss, pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE),
and perceptual loss. Experimental results show that EDNIG achieves competitive

multi-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.
Architectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and
RF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level
ensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW
ensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming
individual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and
localization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture
detection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI
can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical
relevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for
integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited
to binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and
triage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.

Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person
re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance
in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted
significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms
primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving
privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are
typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera
datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance
and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper
introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.
The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,
with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.
We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid
foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on
our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian
attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for
person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only
effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event
streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic
features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully
validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its
degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep
learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately
capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from
hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability
of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can
significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To
further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the
Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover
the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST
and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing
networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI
reconstruction.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object association is a fundamental step in 3D
reconstruction pipelines, enabling consistent grouping of object instances
across multiple camera views. Existing methods often rely on appearance
features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these
approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations
are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves
as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D
reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected
delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate
detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node,
with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap
clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise
and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate
Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error
criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based
baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high
object density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it
well-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.

3T-to-7T models in image-based evaluation metrics. Four blinded MRI
professionals judged our synthetic 7T images as comparable in detail to real 7T
images, and superior in subjective visual quality to 7T images, apparently due
to the reduction of artifacts. Importantly, automated segmentations of the
amygdalae of synthetic GAN U-Net 7T images were more similar to manually
segmented amygdalae (n=20), than automated segmentations from the 3T images
that were used to synthesize the 7T images. Finally, synthetic 7T images showed
similar performance to real 3T images in downstream prediction of cognitive
status using MRI derivatives (n=3,168). In all, we show that synthetic
T1-weighted brain images approaching 7T quality can be generated from 3T
images, which may improve image quality and segmentation, without compromising
performance in downstream tasks. Future directions, possible clinical use
cases, and limitations are discussed.

Conclusion: 病理基础模型可有效加速计算病理学工作流程。

Abstract: Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with rapid progression and high
metastatic potential. Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in
melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual
segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer
variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation
methods. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning network for the
segmentation of five tissue classes in melanoma H&E images. Our approach
leverages Virchow2, a pathology foundation model trained on 3.1 million
histopathology images as a feature extractor. These features are fused with the
original RGB images and subsequently processed by an encoder-decoder
segmentation network (Efficient-UNet) to produce accurate segmentation maps.
The proposed model achieved first place in the tissue segmentation task of the
PUMA Grand Challenge, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability.
Our results show the potential and efficacy of incorporating pathology
foundation models into segmentation networks to accelerate computational
pathology workflows.

Conclusion: 该数据集为驾驶员 drowsiness 研究提供了丰富的多模态信号资源。

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive public dataset for driver
drowsiness detection, integrating multimodal signals of facial, behavioral, and
biometric indicators. Our dataset includes 3D facial video using a depth
camera, IR camera footage, posterior videos, and biometric signals such as
heart rate, electrodermal activity, blood oxygen saturation, skin temperature,
and accelerometer data. This data set provides grip sensor data from the
steering wheel and telemetry data from the American truck simulator game to
provide more information about drivers' behavior while they are alert and
drowsy. Drowsiness levels were self-reported every four minutes using the
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The simulation environment consists of three
monitor setups, and the driving condition is completely like a car. Data were
collected from 19 subjects (15 M, 4 F) in two conditions: when they were fully
alert and when they exhibited signs of sleepiness. Unlike other datasets, our
multimodal dataset has a continuous duration of 40 minutes for each data
collection session per subject, contributing to a total length of 1,400
minutes, and we recorded gradual changes in the driver state rather than
discrete alert/drowsy labels. This study aims to create a comprehensive
multimodal dataset of driver drowsiness that captures a wider range of
physiological, behavioral, and driving-related signals. The dataset will be
available upon request to the corresponding author.

Conclusion: 该技术为AI辅助2D材料表征从实验室研究到工业应用的转化提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics
demands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially
for large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like
conductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data
acquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we
introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately
reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM
scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and
experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow
implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to
collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)
our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that
requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).
SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in
MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of
crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction
in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM
image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit
remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using
classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward
translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research
to industrial fabrication. Code and model weights are available at

Conclusion: 该方法为结构健康监测提供了一种高效、高精度的运动测量解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for structural health monitoring has driven increasing
interest in high-precision motion measurement, as structural information
derived from extracted motions can effectively reflect the current condition of
the structure. Among various motion measurement techniques, vision-based
methods stand out due to their low cost, easy installation, and large-scale
measurement. However, when it comes to sub-pixel-level motion measurement,
current vision-based methods either lack sufficient accuracy or require
extensive manual parameter tuning (e.g., pyramid layers, target pixels, and
filter parameters) to reach good precision. To address this issue, we developed
a novel Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, which can extract the
motion between different frames via tracking the location of Gaussian kernels.
The motion consistency, which fits practical structural conditions, and a
super-resolution constraint, are introduced to increase accuracy and robustness
of our method. Numerical and experimental validations show that it can
consistently reach high accuracy without customized parameter setup for
different test samples.

Conclusion: LoFNO能够实现更精确的脑血管诊断。

Abstract: Hemodynamic analysis is essential for predicting aneurysm rupture and guiding

volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose
the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that
enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall
shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates
Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on
irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution
Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with
neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow
data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation

Abstract: Tunnel lining crack is a crucial indicator of tunnels' safety status. Aiming
to classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,
this study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel
image classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first
step. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the
DeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual
explanation technique. Proposed method combines tunnel image classification and
segmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the
first step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy
and efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated
by experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)
of the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,
which are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and
Transformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score
of the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively,
outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual
explanations in this study are conducive to understanding the "black box" of
deep learning-based models. The developed two-stage deep learning-based method

Abstract: Steganography is the process of embedding secret information discreetly
within a carrier, ensuring secure exchange of confidential data. The Adaptive
Pixel Value Differencing (APVD) steganography method, while effective,
encounters certain challenges like the "unused blocks" issue. This problem can
cause a decrease in security, compromise the embedding capacity, and lead to
lower visual quality. This research presents a novel steganographic strategy
that integrates APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection to effectively mitigate
these issues. The results indicate that the new method outperforms existing
techniques in aspects of security, data hiding capacity, and the preservation
of image quality. Empirical results reveal that the combination of APVD with
pseudorandom pixel selection significantly enhances key image quality metrics
such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Universal Image Quality Index (UIQ),
and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), surpassing other contemporary methods
in performance. The newly proposed method is versatile, able to handle a
variety of cover and secret images in both color and grayscale, thereby
ensuring secure data transmission without compromising the aesthetic quality of

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has successfully transformed
knowledge-based systems such as open domain question nswering, which can
automatically produce vast amounts of seemingly coherent information. Yet,
those models have several disadvantages like hallucinations or confident
generation of incorrect or unverifiable facts. In this paper, we introduce a
new approach to the development of expert systems using LLMs in a controlled

prompt-based extraction approach, we produce a symbolic representation of
knowledge in Prolog, which can be validated and corrected by human experts.
This approach also guarantees interpretability, scalability and reliability of
the developed expert systems. Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with
Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic
coherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid
solution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of
symbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications

Abstract: Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language
models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and
relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during
training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt
engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics
and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and
difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic
latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by
navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our
framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains,
input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage
prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary
results highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI

Abstract: Increasingly, web content is automatically generated by large language models
(LLMs) with little human input. We call this "LLM-dominant" content. Since LLMs
plagiarize and hallucinate, LLM-dominant content can be unreliable and
unethical. Yet, websites rarely disclose such content, and human readers
struggle to distinguish it. Thus, we must develop reliable detectors for
LLM-dominant content. However, state-of-the-art LLM detectors are insufficient,
because they perform well mainly on clean, prose-like text, while web content
has complex markup and diverse genres.
  We propose a highly reliable, scalable pipeline that classifies entire
websites. Instead of naively classifying text extracted from each page, we
classify each site based on an LLM text detector's outputs of multiple
prose-like pages. We train and evaluate our detector by collecting 2 distinct
ground truth datasets totaling 120 sites, and obtain 100% accuracies testing
across them. In the wild, we detect a sizable portion of sites as LLM-dominant
among 10k sites in search engine results and 10k in Common Crawl archives. We
find LLM-dominant sites are growing in prevalence and rank highly in search
results, raising questions about their impact on end users and the overall Web
ecosystem.

Abstract: Nowadays, the importance of software with natural-language user interfaces
cannot be underestimated. In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems,
generating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named
Query Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the
central task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the
rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method
to increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is
still a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and
trustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have
no control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already
included in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that
evaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a
natural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL
generation, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with "anonymized" knowledge
injection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of
the training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will
help to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly
be achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf.
LLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any
knowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM,
s.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is
possible.

Abstract: Partner selection is crucial for cooperation and hinges on communication. As
artificial agents, especially those powered by large language models (LLMs),
become more autonomous, intelligent, and persuasive, they compete with humans
for partnerships. Yet little is known about how humans select between human and
AI partners and adapt under AI-induced competition pressure. We constructed a
communication-based partner selection game and examined the dynamics in hybrid
mini-societies of humans and bots powered by a state-of-the-art LLM. Through
three experiments (N = 975), we found that bots, though more prosocial than
humans and linguistically distinguishable, were not selected preferentially
when their identity was hidden. Instead, humans misattributed bots' behaviour
to humans and vice versa. Disclosing bots' identity induced a dual effect: it
reduced bots' initial chances of being selected but allowed them to gradually
outcompete humans by facilitating human learning about the behaviour of each
partner type. These findings show how AI can reshape social interaction in
mixed societies and inform the design of more effective and cooperative hybrid
systems.

Conclusion: 因果知识转移为多智能体强化学习在非平稳环境中的适应提供了一种高效方法。

Abstract: [Context] Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved notable
success in environments where agents must learn coordinated behaviors. However,
transferring knowledge across agents remains challenging in non-stationary
environments with changing goals. [Problem] Traditional knowledge transfer
methods in MARL struggle to generalize, and agents often require costly
retraining to adapt. [Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge
transfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal
representations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the
environment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive
recovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention
instantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect
corresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while
increasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative
reward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent
and is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by
querying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results]
Our findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were
able to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully
retrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of
causal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment
complexity and agents' heterogeneous goals.

TL;DR: CUDA-L1是一个基于强化学习的自动化CUDA优化框架，显著提升GPU计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型的发展导致GPU计算资源需求激增，急需自动化CUDA优化策略。

Method: 采用强化学习框架训练LLM，通过速度提升奖励信号优化CUDA内核。

Result: 在多种GPU架构上实现显著速度提升（平均x17.7），并发现新的优化技术。

Conclusion: 强化学习可有效将LLM转化为CUDA优化器，无需人工干预。

Abstract: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the
rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for
automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show
promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low
success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an
automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.
  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:
trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250
CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the
model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,
achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,
x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.
Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable
properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns
to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers
fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious
performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that
harm performance.
  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can
transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer
through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain
knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning
abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated
optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU
efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into conversational robots
has made human-robot conversations more dynamic. Yet, LLM-powered
conversational robots remain prone to errors, e.g., misunderstanding user
intent, prematurely interrupting users, or failing to respond altogether.
Detecting and addressing these failures is critical for preventing
conversational breakdowns, avoiding task disruptions, and sustaining user
trust. To tackle this problem, the ERR@HRI 2.0 Challenge provides a multimodal
dataset of LLM-powered conversational robot failures during human-robot
conversations and encourages researchers to benchmark machine learning models
designed to detect robot failures. The dataset includes 16 hours of dyadic
human-robot interactions, incorporating facial, speech, and head movement
features. Each interaction is annotated with the presence or absence of robot
errors from the system perspective, and perceived user intention to correct for
a mismatch between robot behavior and user expectation. Participants are
invited to form teams and develop machine learning models that detect these
failures using multimodal data. Submissions will be evaluated using various
performance metrics, including detection accuracy and false positive rate. This
challenge represents another key step toward improving failure detection in
human-robot interaction through social signal analysis.

bi-level optimization problem: the upper-level objective degrades the model's
ability to represent harmful concepts using representation noising and
maximization, while the lower-level objective preserves performance on safe

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for intelligent

which fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven
traffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies
as nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution
and dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a
Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency

analysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware
token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed
architecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility
environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces
token consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to
TrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to

Abstract: Personalizing AI systems requires understanding not just what users prefer,
but the reasons that underlie those preferences - yet current preference models
typically treat human judgment as a black box. We introduce PrefPalette, a
framework that decomposes preferences into attribute dimensions and tailors its
preference prediction to distinct social community values in a
human-interpretable manner. PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science
principle known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable
counterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic
training data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality,
humor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that
learns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes.
This approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse
evaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social
communities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by
46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements,
PrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:
scholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented
communities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities
emphasize empathy. By modeling the attribute-mediated structure of human
judgment, PrefPalette delivers both superior preference modeling and
transparent, interpretable insights, and serves as a first step toward more
trustworthy, value-aware personalized applications.

Abstract: Information retrieval and question answering from safety regulations are
essential for automated construction compliance checking but are hindered by
the linguistic and structural complexity of regulatory text. Many
compliance-related queries are multi-hop, requiring synthesis of information
across interlinked clauses. This poses a challenge for traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. To overcome this, we introduce
BifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both
linguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure
(via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval
mechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search,
enabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the
structure of the text. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that
BifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1
score of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and
graph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches. Error
analysis further highlights the comparative advantages of our hybrid method
over single-modality RAGs. These findings establish BifrostRAG as a robust
knowledge engine for LLM-driven compliance checking. Its dual-graph, hybrid

structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance
and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a
lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and
substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge
retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching,

patch 68% of the time outperforming GPT-4o by 9 percentage points (pp). The

Abstract: The modern recommender systems are facing an increasing challenge of
modelling and predicting the dynamic and context-rich user preferences.
Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based methods often struggle to
capture the temporal patternings and evolving user intentions. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have gained gradual attention in recent years, by their
strong semantic understanding and reasoning abilities, they are not inherently
designed to model chronologically evolving user preference and intentions. On
the other hand, for sequential models like LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) which
is good at capturing the temporal dynamics of user behaviour and evolving user
preference over time, but still lacks a rich semantic understanding for
comprehensive recommendation generation. In this study, we propose DUALRec
(Dynamic User-Aware Language-based Recommender), a novel recommender that
leverages the complementary strength of both models, which combines the
temporal modelling abilities of LSTM networks with semantic reasoning power of
the fine-tuned Large Language Models. The LSTM component will capture users
evolving preference through their viewing history, while the fine-tuned LLM
variants will leverage these temporal user insights to generate next movies
that users might enjoy. Experimental results on MovieLens-1M dataset shows that
the DUALRec model outperforms a wide range of baseline models, with
comprehensive evaluation matrices of Hit Rate (HR@k), Normalized Discounted
Cumulative Gain (NDCG@k), and genre similarity metrics. This research proposes
a novel architecture that bridges the gap between temporal sequence modeling
and semantic reasoning, and offers a promising direction for developing more
intelligent and context-aware recommenders.

### [164] [Why Isn't Relational Learning Taking Over the World?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13558)
*David Poole*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了当前AI领域过度关注文本和图像数据建模，而忽视了实体及其关系的建模，呼吁重视关系学习（relational learning）的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI主要建模文本和图像数据，但现实世界由实体及其关系构成。关系学习领域虽存在，但未得到足够重视。

Method: 通过分析关系学习的现状和限制，提出其发展不足的原因及改进方向。

Result: 关系学习目前仅在有限领域应用，需进一步研究以提升其影响力。

Conclusion: 关系学习应成为AI研究的核心方向，以更准确地建模现实世界。

Abstract: AI seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words,
and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes
but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and
relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or
description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and
pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text
and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most
valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These
are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are
full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other
identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that
studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning,
statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational
learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted
relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.

Conclusion: 基于最终答案的错误诊断方法具有潜力，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Many intelligent tutoring systems can support a student in solving a stepwise
task. When a student combines several steps in one step, the number of possible
paths connecting consecutive inputs may be very large. This combinatorial
explosion makes error diagnosis hard. Using a final answer to diagnose a
combination of steps can mitigate the combinatorial explosion, because there
are generally fewer possible (erroneous) final answers than (erroneous)
solution paths. An intermediate input for a task can be diagnosed by
automatically completing it according to the task solution strategy and
diagnosing this solution. This study explores the potential of automated error
diagnosis based on a final answer. We investigate the design of a service that
provides a buggy rule diagnosis when a student combines several steps. To
validate the approach, we apply the service to an existing dataset (n=1939) of
unique student steps when solving quadratic equations, which could not be
diagnosed by a buggy rule service that tries to connect consecutive inputs with
a single rule. Results show that final answer evaluation can diagnose 29,4% of
these steps. Moreover, a comparison of the generated diagnoses with teacher
diagnoses on a subset (n=115) shows that the diagnoses align in 97% of the
cases. These results can be considered a basis for further exploration of the
approach.

heuristics through a process of semantic interdependence inspired by research
in quantum cognition. Unlike traditional decision engines that select the best
rule, our system fuses conflicting heuristics into coherent and
context-sensitive narratives, guided by semantic interaction modeling and
rhetorical framing. We demonstrate the framework via a Meta vs. FTC case study,
with preliminary validation through semantic metrics. Limitations and
extensions (e.g., dynamic interference tuning) are discussed.

Result: 实验表明ADPC在区分CN/MCI/AD病例中表现优异，达到SOTA指标。

Conclusion: 研究展示了因果推理与多模态学习在神经疾病诊断中的潜力。

Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's
Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow
the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant
challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection
bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To
address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention
framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal
Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language
model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining
structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.
The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)
images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into
Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of
confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,
non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,
generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates
confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The
study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal
learning for neurological disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Human motion simulation (HMS) supports cost-effective evaluation of worker

methods often suffer from low motion fidelity. This study introduces
Generative-AI-Enabled HMS (G-AI-HMS), which integrates text-to-text and
text-to-motion models to enhance simulation quality for physical tasks.
G-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into
motion-aware language using Large Language Models aligned with MotionGPT's
training vocabulary, and (2) validating AI-enhanced motions against real human
movements using computer vision. Posture estimation algorithms are applied to
real-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are
used to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving
eight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created
descriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial
accuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven
tasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that
AI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and
temporal misalignment while retaining comparable posture accuracy.

cultural, historical, and individual biases, potentially leading to a deeper
understanding of universal ethical foundations. The paper also examines a
paradoxical aspect of the hypothesis, in which AI systems could potentially

In this work, we examine the current literature on RTL generation using LLMs

involving database (DB) creation and management with PostgreSQL, data
collection from code hosting sites like OpenCores and GitHub, and data
preprocessing to verify the codes' syntax, run logic synthesis, and extract
relevant module metadata. We implement a scalable and efficient DB
infrastructure to support analysis and detail our preprocessing pipeline to
enforce high-quality data before DB insertion. The resulting dataset comprises
20,392 Verilog samples, 751 MB of Verilog code data, which is the largest
high-quality Verilog dataset for LLM fine-tuning to our knowledge. We further

Method: 基于社会角色建立双层动态模型，引入非侵入式邻居过滤方法，并使用多智能体强化学习（MARL）优化信息传播路径。

Result: H-NeiFi将共识速度提高了22.0%至30.7%，并在无专家情况下保持全局收敛。

Conclusion: H-NeiFi通过保护用户交互自主性，提供了一种新的社交网络治理范式。

Abstract: The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it
also presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus.
Existing methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group
connections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke
psychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus.
Additionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local
consensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these
issues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework,
H-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles,
considering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts.
Additionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that
adaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths
through a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user
interactions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0%
to 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This
approach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user
interaction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance.

Conclusion: SEER通过语义增强和情感推理有效提升了假新闻检测性能。

Abstract: Previous studies on multimodal fake news detection mainly focus on the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features, as well as the application
of text-image consistency. However, they overlook the semantic enhancement
effects of large multimodal models and pay little attention to the emotional
features of news. In addition, people find that fake news is more inclined to
contain negative emotions than real ones. Therefore, we propose a novel
Semantic Enhancement and Emotional Reasoning (SEER) Network for multimodal fake
news detection. We generate summarized captions for image semantic
understanding and utilize the products of large multimodal models for semantic
enhancement. Inspired by the perceived relationship between news authenticity
and emotional tendencies, we propose an expert emotional reasoning module that
simulates real-life scenarios to optimize emotional features and infer the
authenticity of news. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our SEER over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 层间学习规则的多样性有助于提升准确性和可扩展性，未来可进一步研究混合多种生物启发学习规则。

Abstract: Bio-inspired neural networks are attractive for their adversarial robustness,
energy frugality, and closer alignment with cortical physiology, yet they often
lag behind back-propagation (BP) based models in accuracy and ability to scale.
We show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in
different layers, discovered automatically by a tailored
neural-architecture-search (NAS) procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from
standard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired
learning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to
use in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired
learning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a
single rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of
bio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on
CIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on
ImageNet. In some regimes, they even surpass comparable BP-based networks while
retaining their robustness advantages. Our results suggest that layer-wise
diversity in learning rules allows better scalability and accuracy, and
motivates further research on mixing multiple bio-inspired learning rules in
the same network.

Abstract: Rare, yet critical, scenarios pose a significant challenge in testing and
evaluating autonomous driving planners. Relying solely on real-world driving
scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While
automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models
require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the
output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a
distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the
validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep
this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting
original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual
augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet
the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore,
this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting
real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing
the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic
design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high
performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert
evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user
intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created
manually.

Conclusion: 人类和人工视觉系统在视觉编码上存在共同的解决方案，由外部世界结构驱动。

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual
perception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal
architecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual
differences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity
patterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational
principle. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common
trajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its
transformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We
introduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining
inter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this
framework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we
reveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two
pathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal
stream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is
captured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing
the specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a
convergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and
artificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.

Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and edge computing has spurred
growing interest in enabling intelligent services directly on
resource-constrained devices. While traditional deep learning models require
significant computational resources and centralized data management, the
resulting latency, bandwidth consumption, and privacy concerns have exposed
critical limitations in cloud-centric paradigms. Brain-inspired computing,
particularly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers a promising alternative by
emulating biological neuronal dynamics to achieve low-power, event-driven
computation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Edge Intelligence
based on SNNs (EdgeSNNs), examining their potential to address the challenges
of on-device learning, inference, and security in edge scenarios. We present a
systematic taxonomy of EdgeSNN foundations, encompassing neuron models,
learning algorithms, and supporting hardware platforms. Three representative
practical considerations of EdgeSNN are discussed in depth: on-device inference
using lightweight SNN models, resource-aware training and updating under
non-stationary data conditions, and secure and privacy-preserving issues.
Furthermore, we highlight the limitations of evaluating EdgeSNNs on
conventional hardware and introduce a dual-track benchmarking strategy to
support fair comparisons and hardware-aware optimization. Through this study,
we aim to bridge the gap between brain-inspired learning and practical edge
deployment, offering insights into current advancements, open challenges, and
future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
dedicated and comprehensive survey on EdgeSNNs, providing an essential
reference for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of
neuromorphic computing and edge intelligence.

Abstract: Model tracing and constraint-based modeling are two approaches to diagnose
student input in stepwise tasks. Model tracing supports identifying consecutive
problem-solving steps taken by a student, whereas constraint-based modeling
supports student input diagnosis even when several steps are combined into one
step. We propose an approach that merges both paradigms. By defining
constraints as properties that a student input has in common with a step of a
strategy, it is possible to provide a diagnosis when a student deviates from a
strategy even when the student combines several steps. In this study we explore
the design of a system for multistep strategy diagnoses, and evaluate these
diagnoses. As a proof of concept, we generate diagnoses for an existing dataset
containing steps students take when solving quadratic equations (n=2136). To
compare with human diagnoses, two teachers coded a random sample of deviations
(n=70) and applications of the strategy (n=70). Results show that that the
system diagnosis aligned with the teacher coding in all of the 140 student
steps.

Conclusion: OntView解决了现有工具在复杂本体可视化上的不足，提升了用户理解能力。

Abstract: In the field of knowledge management and computer science, ontologies provide
a structured framework for modeling domain-specific knowledge by defining
concepts and their relationships. However, the lack of tools that provide
effective visualization is still a significant challenge. While numerous
ontology editors and viewers exist, most of them fail to graphically represent
ontology structures in a meaningful and non-overwhelming way, limiting users'
ability to comprehend dependencies and properties within large ontological
frameworks.
  In this paper, we present OntView, an ontology viewer that is designed to
provide users with an intuitive visual representation of ontology concepts and
their formal definitions through a user-friendly interface. Building on the use
of a DL reasoner, OntView follows a "What you see is what you meant" paradigm,
showing the actual inferred knowledge. One key aspect for this is its ability
to visualize General Concept Inclusions (GCI), a feature absent in existing
visualization tools. Moreover, to avoid a possible information overload,
OntView also offers different ways to show a simplified view of the ontology
by: 1) creating ontology summaries by assessing the importance of the concepts
(according to different available algorithms), 2) focusing the visualization on
the existing TBox elements between two given classes and 3) allowing to
hide/show different branches in a dynamic way without losing the semantics.

Motivation: 解决现有T-GNN在动态图中因计算开销大而面临的扩展性和效率问题。

Method: EAGLE框架包含时间感知模块和结构感知模块，采用自适应权重机制动态调整两者贡献，避免复杂多跳消息传递。

Result: 在七个真实动态图上，EAGLE在性能和效率上均优于现有T-GNN，速度提升50倍以上。

Conclusion: EAGLE是一种轻量级高效框架，适用于动态图的时间链接预测任务。

Abstract: Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a critical task with
applications in diverse domains such as social networks, recommendation
systems, and e-commerce platforms. While existing Temporal Graph Neural
Networks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex
architectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer
from scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead.
In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates
short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE
consists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most
recent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware
module that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence
of globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an
adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on
data characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop
message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant
improvements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal
graphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance
against state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency,
delivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic systems with a fine-grained temporal and numeric

Answer Set Programming (ASP). To address this, we introduce and elaborate upon
a novel temporal and constraint-based extension of the logic of Here-and-There
and its nonmonotonic equilibrium extension, representing, to the best of our
knowledge, the first approach to nonmonotonic temporal reasoning with
constraints specifically tailored for ASP. This expressive system is achieved
by a synergistic combination of two foundational ASP extensions: the
linear-time logic of Here-and-There, providing robust nonmonotonic temporal
reasoning capabilities, and the logic of Here-and-There with constraints,
enabling the direct integration and manipulation of numeric constraints, among
others. This work establishes the foundational logical framework for tackling
complex dynamic systems with high resolution within the ASP paradigm.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are a critical part of

from 2500+ people across 4 countries. Participants include persons living with
type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and no diabetes. To support
researchers and innovators with using this rich collection of diabetes
datasets, we present a comparative analysis to guide algorithm developers with
data selection. Additionally, we conduct a case study for the task of blood
glucose prediction - one of the most common AI tasks within the field. Through
this case study, we provide a benchmark for short-term blood glucose prediction

Abstract: Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI)-driven electronic design and
automation (EDA) tools, high-performance computing, and parallelized algorithms
are essential for next-generation microprocessor innovation, ensuring continued
progress in computing, AI, and semiconductor technology. Machine learning-based
design rule checking (DRC) and lithography hotspot detection can improve
first-pass silicon success. However, conventional ML and neural network
(NN)-based models use supervised learning and require a large balanced dataset
(in terms of positive and negative classes) and training time. This research
addresses those key challenges by proposing the first-ever unsupervised DRC
violation prediction methodology. The proposed model can be built using any
unbalanced dataset using only one class and set a threshold for it, then
fitting any new data querying if they are within the boundary of the model for
classification. This research verified the proposed model by implementing
different computational cores using CMOS 28 nm technology and Synopsys Design
Compiler and IC Compiler II tools. Then, layouts were divided into virtual
grids to collect about 60k data for analysis and verification. The proposed
method has 99.95% prediction test accuracy, while the existing support vector
machine (SVM) and neural network (NN) models have 85.44\% and 98.74\% accuracy,

Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC), which aims to unsupervisedly separate the nodes
in an attribute graph into different clusters, has seen substantial potential
in various industrial scenarios like community detection and recommendation.
However, the real-world attribute graphs, e.g., social networks interactions,
are usually large-scale and attribute-missing. To solve these two problems, we
propose a novel DGC method termed \underline{\textbf{C}}omplementary
\underline{\textbf{M}}ulti-\underline{\textbf{V}}iew
\underline{\textbf{N}}eighborhood \underline{\textbf{D}}ifferentiation
(\textit{CMV-ND}), which preprocesses graph structural information into
multiple views in a complete but non-redundant manner. First, to ensure
completeness of the structural information, we propose a recursive neighborhood
search that recursively explores the local structure of the graph by completely
expanding node neighborhoods across different hop distances. Second, to
eliminate the redundancy between neighborhoods at different hops, we introduce
a neighborhood differential strategy that ensures no overlapping nodes between
the differential hop representations. Then, we construct $K+1$ complementary
views from the $K$ differential hop representations and the features of the
target node. Last, we apply existing multi-view clustering or DGC methods to
the views. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets demonstrate
that CMV-ND significantly improves the performance of various methods.

Abstract: Cybersecurity simulation environments, such as cyber ranges, honeypots, and
sandboxes, require realistic human behavior to be effective, yet no
quantitative method exists to assess the behavioral fidelity of synthetic user
personas. This paper presents PHASE (Passive Human Activity Simulation
Evaluation), a machine learning framework that analyzes Zeek connection logs
and distinguishes human from non-human activity with over 90\% accuracy. PHASE
operates entirely passively, relying on standard network monitoring without any
user-side instrumentation or visible signs of surveillance. All network
activity used for machine learning is collected via a Zeek network appliance to
avoid introducing unnecessary network traffic or artifacts that could disrupt
the fidelity of the simulation environment. The paper also proposes a novel
labeling approach that utilizes local DNS records to classify network traffic,
thereby enabling machine learning analysis. Furthermore, we apply SHAP (SHapley
Additive exPlanations) analysis to uncover temporal and behavioral signatures
indicative of genuine human users. In a case study, we evaluate a synthetic
user persona and identify distinct non-human patterns that undermine behavioral
realism. Based on these insights, we develop a revised behavioral configuration
that significantly improves the human-likeness of synthetic activity yielding a
more realistic and effective synthetic user persona.

Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function

establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and
statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free
energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the
structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis
kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic
scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is
shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase
transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models
verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay
between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.

Conclusion: PE-PSO在复杂环境下的多无人机实时操作中表现出高效性和适用性。

Abstract: Real-time trajectory planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic
environments remains a key challenge due to high computational demands and the
need for fast, adaptive responses. Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with
premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these
limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory
planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve
swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to
dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using
B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization
complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent
framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with
distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation.
The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized
control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining
real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across
several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle
avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and
applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex
environmental conditions.

Abstract: Point of interest (POI) recommendation can play a pivotal role in enriching
tourists' experiences by suggesting context-dependent and preference-matching
locations and activities, such as restaurants, landmarks, itineraries, and
cultural attractions. Unlike some more common recommendation domains (e.g.,
music and video), POI recommendation is inherently high-stakes: users invest
significant time, money, and effort to search, choose, and consume these
suggested POIs. Despite the numerous research works in the area, several
fundamental issues remain unresolved, hindering the real-world applicability of
the proposed approaches. In this paper, we discuss the current status of the
POI recommendation problem and the main challenges we have identified. The
first contribution of this paper is a critical assessment of the current state
of POI recommendation research and the identification of key shortcomings
across three main dimensions: datasets, algorithms, and evaluation
methodologies. We highlight persistent issues such as the lack of standardized
benchmark datasets, flawed assumptions in the problem definition and model
design, and inadequate treatment of biases in the user behavior and system
performance. The second contribution is a structured research agenda that,
starting from the identified issues, introduces important directions for future
work related to multistakeholder design, context awareness, data collection,
trustworthiness, novel interactions, and real-world evaluation.

Abstract: This paper presents the Photonic FabricTM and the Photonic Fabric ApplianceTM
(PFA), a photonic-enabled switch and memory subsystem that delivers low
latency, high bandwidth, and low per-bit energy. By integrating high-bandwidth
HBM3E memory, an on-module photonic switch, and external DDR5 in a 2.5D
electro-optical system-in-package, the PFA offers up to 32 TB of shared memory
alongside 115 Tbps of all-to-all digital switching. The Photonic FabricTM
enables distributed AI training and inference to execute parallelism strategies
more efficiently. The Photonic Fabric removes the silicon beachfront constraint
that limits the fixed memory-to-compute ratio observed in virtually all current
XPU accelerator designs. Replacing a local HBM stack on an XPU with a chiplet
that connects to the Photonic Fabric increases its memory capacity and
correspondingly its memory bandwidth by offering a flexible path to scaling
well beyond the limitations of on-package HBM alone. We introduce CelestiSim, a
lightweight analytical simulator validated on NVIDIA H100 and H200 systems. It
is used to evaluate the performance of LLM reference and energy savings on PFA,
without any significant change to the GPU core design. With the PFA, the
simulation results show that up to 3.66x throughput and 1.40x latency
improvements in LLM inference at 405B parameters, up to 7.04x throughput and
1.41x latency improvements at 1T parameters, and 60-90% energy savings in data
movement for heavy collective operations in all LLM training scenarios. While
these results are shown for NVIDIA GPUs, they can be applied similarly to other
AI accelerator designs (XPUs) that share the same fundamental limitation of
fixed memory to compute.

Abstract: Humans have a selective memory, remembering relevant episodes and forgetting
the less relevant information. Possessing awareness of event memorability for a
user could help intelligent systems in more accurate user modelling, especially
for such applications as meeting support systems, memory augmentation, and
meeting summarisation. Emotion recognition has been widely studied, since
emotions are thought to signal moments of high personal relevance to users. The
emotional experience of situations and their memorability have traditionally
been considered to be closely tied to one another: moments that are experienced
as highly emotional are considered to also be highly memorable. This
relationship suggests that emotional annotations could serve as proxies for
memorability. However, existing emotion recognition systems rely heavily on
third-party annotations, which may not accurately represent the first-person
experience of emotional relevance and memorability. This is why, in this study,
we empirically examine the relationship between perceived group emotions
(Pleasure-Arousal) and group memorability in the context of conversational
interactions. Our investigation involves continuous time-based annotations of
both emotions and memorability in dynamic, unstructured group settings,
approximating conditions of real-world conversational AI applications such as
online meeting support systems. Our results show that the observed relationship
between affect and memorability annotations cannot be reliably distinguished
from what might be expected under random chance. We discuss the implications of
this surprising finding for the development and applications of Affective
Computing technology. In addition, we contextualise our findings in broader
discourses in the Affective Computing and point out important targets for
future research efforts.

Abstract: Surrogate models for the rapid inference of nonlinear boundary value problems
in mechanics are helpful in a broad range of engineering applications. However,
effective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of
deformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an
open issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact
or, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact
planes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that
serve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions
for detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture
that utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time,
incorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable
bodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft
tissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic
valve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the
loss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits
hold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and
complex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also
demonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries.
However, such benefits come with high computational costs during training,
resulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the
training cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware
architectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in
up to a thousand-fold speedup for our benchmark problems at inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有乳腺MRI分割方法仅关注少数解剖结构，限制了定量分析的实用性。本研究旨在开发覆盖更多结构的分割算法。

Method: 使用手动标注的1123个MRI切片训练和评估了9个分割模型，包括U-Net、SwinUNet、UNet++等。

Result: nnU-Net ResEncM表现最佳，平均Dice得分为0.694，尤其在心脏、肝脏等结构上表现优异。

Conclusion: BreastSegNet显著扩展了乳腺MRI分割的范围，为定量分析提供了更全面的工具。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution imaging critical for breast cancer
screening and preoperative staging. However, existing segmentation methods for
breast MRI remain limited in scope, often focusing on only a few anatomical
structures, such as fibroglandular tissue or tumors, and do not cover the full
range of tissues seen in scans. This narrows their utility for quantitative
analysis. In this study, we present BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation
algorithm for breast MRI that covers nine anatomical labels: fibroglandular
tissue (FGT), vessel, muscle, bone, lesion, lymph node, heart, liver, and
implant. We manually annotated a large set of 1123 MRI slices capturing these
structures with detailed review and correction from an expert radiologist.
Additionally, we benchmark nine segmentation models, including U-Net, SwinUNet,
UNet++, SAM, MedSAM, and nnU-Net with multiple ResNet-based encoders. Among
them, nnU-Net ResEncM achieves the highest average Dice scores of 0.694 across
all labels. It performs especially well on heart, liver, muscle, FGT, and bone,
with Dice scores exceeding 0.73, and approaching 0.90 for heart and liver. All
model code and weights are publicly available, and we plan to release the data
at a later date.

Conclusion: MISO在解决优化问题和实际应用中表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms have gained widespread application across various
fields owing to their ability to generate diverse solutions. One such algorithm
is the Snake Optimizer (SO), a progressive optimization approach. However, SO
suffers from the issues of slow convergence speed and susceptibility to local
optima. In light of these shortcomings, we propose a novel Multi-strategy
Improved Snake Optimizer (MISO). Firstly, we propose a new adaptive random
disturbance strategy based on sine function to alleviate the risk of getting
trapped in a local optimum. Secondly, we introduce adaptive Levy flight
strategy based on scale factor and leader and endow the male snake leader with
flight capability, which makes it easier for the algorithm to leap out of the
local optimum and find the global optimum. More importantly, we put forward a
position update strategy combining elite leadership and Brownian motion,
effectively accelerating the convergence speed while ensuring precision.
Finally, to demonstrate the performance of MISO, we utilize 30 CEC2017 test
functions and the CEC2022 test suite, comparing it with 11 popular algorithms
across different dimensions to validate its effectiveness. Moreover, Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields due to its
advantages of low cost, high mobility and easy operation. However, the UAV path
planning problem is crucial for flight safety and efficiency, and there are
still challenges in establishing and optimizing the path model. Therefore, we
apply MISO to the UAV 3D path planning problem as well as 6 engineering design
problems to assess its feasibility in practical applications. The experimental
results demonstrate that MISO exceeds other competitive algorithms in terms of
solution quality and stability, establishing its strong potential for
application.

current format with data distributed across approximately 1000 files totaling
several hundred gigabytes hinders accessibility and analysis. To address this,
we introduce the CompreHensive European Food Safety (CHEFS) database, which
consolidates EFSA monitoring data on pesticide residues, veterinary medicinal

demonstrate its potential by analyzing trends in European food safety
monitoring data from 2000 to 2024. Our analyses explore changes in monitoring

non-compliant and which contaminants were most often found, and differences
across countries. These findings highlight the CHEFS database as both a

Conclusion: 通过物理模型揭示了Transformer架构的理论基础，为理解其工作机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 (cf.\cite{VSP2017})
marked the most striking advancement in natural language processing. The
transformer is a model architecture relying entirely on an attention mechanism
to draw global dependencies between input and output. However, we believe there
is a gap in our theoretical understanding of what the transformer is, and why
it works physically. In this paper, from a physical perspective on modern
chips, we construct physical models in the Fock space over the Hilbert space of
tokens realizing large language models based on a transformer architecture as
open quantum systems. Our physical models underlie the transformer architecture
for large language models.

Motivation: 研究ICL的机制，解释LLMs如何通过隐藏表示内部化数据生成过程（DGP）的结构，从而超越预训练阶段学到的内容。

Method: 引入双收敛框架，分析隐藏表示在上下文和层间的收敛过程，证明其对平滑（低频）表示的隐式偏好。

Result: 理论解释了ICL的全局结构化但局部扭曲的几何特性、能量衰减现象，并预测了其对高频噪声的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究为ICL的机制提供了新的理论见解，为更广泛的数据分布和设置奠定了基础。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire new
behaviors from the input sequence alone without any parameter updates. Recent
studies have shown that ICL can surpass the original meaning learned in
pretraining stage through internalizing the structure the data-generating
process (DGP) of the prompt into the hidden representations. However, the
mechanisms by which LLMs achieve this ability is left open. In this paper, we
present the first rigorous explanation of such phenomena by introducing a
unified framework of double convergence, where hidden representations converge
both over context and across layers. This double convergence process leads to
an implicit bias towards smooth (low-frequency) representations, which we prove
analytically and verify empirically. Our theory explains several open empirical
observations, including why learned representations exhibit globally structured
but locally distorted geometry, and why their total energy decays without
vanishing. Moreover, our theory predicts that ICL has an intrinsic robustness
towards high-frequency noise, which we empirically confirm. These results
provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ICL, and a theoretical
foundation to study it that hopefully extends to more general data
distributions and settings.

Motivation: 传统Transformer在固定深度下表达能力有限，而自回归方法依赖外部化中间状态。SELF-Transformer旨在通过内部迭代提升表达能力。

Method: 引入SELF-Transformer，通过迭代更新注意力权重至固定点，动态调整计算以适应输入难度。

Result: 在编码器任务中实现高达20%的准确率提升，且不增加参数量。

Conclusion: SELF-Transformer在保持编码器简洁性的同时，显著提升了表达能力。

Abstract: Transformers evaluated in a single, fixed-depth pass are provably limited in
expressive power to the constant-depth circuit class TC0. Running a Transformer
autoregressively removes that ceiling -- first in next-token prediction and,
more recently, in chain-of-thought reasoning. Both regimes rely on feedback
loops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in
subsequent steps. While this "thinking aloud" mirrors human reasoning,
biological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as
language. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without
resorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an
encoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed
point. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes
the input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix
internally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty. This
adaptivity yields up to 20\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without
increasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test
time offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget.
Self-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative
reasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures.

Abstract: As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have
expanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to
align to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more
helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it
models the entire user population with a single reward model. We present a
novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that learns
text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past
conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make
personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. We
train the user-summarization model with reinforcement learning, and update the
reward model simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show
that in contrast with prior personalized RLHF techniques or with in-context
learning of user information, summaries produced by PLUS capture meaningful
aspects of a user's preferences. Across different pluralistic user datasets, we
show that our method is robust to new users and diverse conversation topics.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the textual summaries generated about users
can be transferred for zero-shot personalization of stronger, proprietary
models like GPT-4. The resulting user summaries are not only concise and
portable, they are easy for users to interpret and modify, allowing for more
transparency and user control in LLM alignment.

Abstract: Automated data preparation is crucial for democratizing machine learning, yet
existing reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches suffer from inefficient
exploration in the vast space of possible preprocessing pipelines. We present
LLaPipe, a novel framework that addresses this exploration bottleneck by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent policy advisors. Unlike
traditional methods that rely solely on statistical features and blind
trial-and-error, LLaPipe leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of
LLMs to provide contextually relevant exploration guidance. Our framework
introduces three key innovations: (1) an LLM Policy Advisor that analyzes
dataset semantics and pipeline history to suggest promising preprocessing
operations, (2) an Experience Distillation mechanism that mines successful
patterns from past pipelines and transfers this knowledge to guide future
exploration, and (3) an Adaptive Advisor Triggering strategy
(Advisor\textsuperscript{+}) that dynamically determines when LLM intervention
is most beneficial, balancing exploration effectiveness with computational
cost. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse datasets spanning multiple
domains, we demonstrate that LLaPipe achieves up to 22.4\% improvement in
pipeline quality and 2.3$\times$ faster convergence compared to
state-of-the-art RL-based methods, while maintaining computational efficiency
through selective LLM usage (averaging only 19.0\% of total exploration steps).

Abstract: Training sophisticated agents for optimal decision-making under uncertainty
has been key to the rapid development of modern autonomous systems across
fields. Notably, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled
decision-making agents to improve their performance directly through system
interactions, with minimal prior knowledge about the system. Yet, model-free RL
has generally relied on agents equipped with deep neural network function
approximators, appealing to the networks' expressivity to capture the agent's
policy and value function for complex systems. However, neural networks amplify
the issues of sample inefficiency, unsafe learning, and limited
interpretability in model-free RL. To this end, this work introduces
model-based agents as a compelling alternative for control policy
approximation, leveraging adaptable models of system dynamics, cost, and
constraints for safe policy learning. These models can encode prior system
knowledge to inform, constrain, and aid in explaining the agent's decisions,
while deficiencies due to model mismatch can be remedied with model-free RL. We
outline the benefits and challenges of learning model-based agents --
exemplified by model predictive control -- and detail the primary learning
approaches: Bayesian optimization, policy search RL, and offline strategies,
along with their respective strengths. While model-free RL has long been
established, its interplay with model-based agents remains largely unexplored,
motivating our perspective on their combined potentials for sample-efficient
learning of safe and interpretable decision-making agents.

introduces a systematic method for ontology alignment, grounded in cosine-based
semantic similarity between a biomedical layman vocabulary and the Unified
Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. It leverages Microsoft Olive to

an average inference speed-up of 20x and reducing memory usage by approximately

Conclusion: 该方法为次模奖励函数的强化学习问题提供了有效的近似解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (abbreviated as RL), an agent interacts with the
environment via a set of possible actions, and a reward is generated from some
unknown distribution. The task here is to find an optimal set of actions such
that the reward after a certain time step gets maximized. In a traditional
setup, the reward function in an RL Problem is considered additive. However, in
reality, there exist many problems, including path planning, coverage control,
etc., the reward function follows the diminishing return, which can be modeled
as a submodular function. In this paper, we study a variant of the RL Problem
where the reward function is submodular, and our objective is to find an
optimal policy such that this reward function gets maximized. We have proposed
a pruned submodularity graph-based approach that provides a provably
approximate solution in a feasible computation time. The proposed approach has
been analyzed to understand its time and space requirements as well as a
performance guarantee. We have experimented with a benchmark agent-environment
setup, which has been used for similar previous studies, and the results are
reported. From the results, we observe that the policy obtained by our proposed
approach leads to more reward than the baseline methods.

Motivation: 现有神经因果模型多假设静态因果图，忽略了因果交互的动态性，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入Causal Process框架，通过RL代理构建动态因果图假设，类似Transformer的注意力机制。

Result: 在RL环境中，方法在因果表示学习和代理性能上优于现有方法，并能恢复动态因果过程图。

Conclusion: Causal Process框架为动态因果结构提供了新理论支持，并在RL中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Formal frameworks of causality have operated largely parallel to modern
trends in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, there has been a revival
of interest in formally grounding the representations learned by neural
networks in causal concepts. Yet, most attempts at neural models of causality
assume static causal graphs and ignore the dynamic nature of causal
interactions. In this work, we introduce Causal Process framework as a novel
theory for representing dynamic hypotheses about causal structure. Furthermore,
we present Causal Process Model as an implementation of this framework. This
allows us to reformulate the attention mechanism popularized by Transformer
networks within an RL setting with the goal to infer interpretable causal
processes from visual observations. Here, causal inference corresponds to
constructing a causal graph hypothesis which itself becomes an RL task nested
within the original RL problem. To create an instance of such hypothesis, we
employ RL agents. These agents establish links between units similar to the
original Transformer attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in an RL environment where we outperform current alternatives in
causal representation learning and agent performance, and uniquely recover
graphs of dynamic causal processes.

Motivation: 传统的多目标强化学习依赖于预定义的奖励函数，难以平衡冲突目标且可能导致过度简化。偏好作为更灵活直观的决策指导，可以解决这一问题。

Method: 论文提出了Pb-MORL方法，通过构建与偏好对齐的多目标奖励模型，指导策略优化，并理论证明了优化该模型等价于训练帕累托最优策略。

Result: 在多个基准任务（多能源管理和自动驾驶）中，Pb-MORL表现优异，甚至超过了使用真实奖励函数的方法。

Conclusion: Pb-MORL展示了在复杂现实系统中应用的潜力，提供了一种更灵活的决策框架。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is a structured approach for
optimizing tasks with multiple objectives. However, it often relies on
pre-defined reward functions, which can be hard to design for balancing
conflicting goals and may lead to oversimplification. Preferences can serve as
more flexible and intuitive decision-making guidance, eliminating the need for
complicated reward design. This paper introduces preference-based MORL
(Pb-MORL), which formalizes the integration of preferences into the MORL
framework. We theoretically prove that preferences can derive policies across
the entire Pareto frontier. To guide policy optimization using preferences, our
method constructs a multi-objective reward model that aligns with the given
preferences. We further provide theoretical proof to show that optimizing this
reward model is equivalent to training the Pareto optimal policy. Extensive
experiments in benchmark multi-objective tasks, a multi-energy management task,
and an autonomous driving task on a multi-line highway show that our method
performs competitively, surpassing the oracle method, which uses the ground
truth reward function. This highlights its potential for practical applications
in complex real-world systems.

theory. Our DPMT framework incorporates a multi-scale theory of mind (ToM)
module to facilitate robust human partner modeling through mental
characteristic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that DPMT
significantly enhances human-AI collaboration, and ablation studies further
validate the contributions of our multi-scale ToM in the slow system.

Conclusion: CogniQ-H通过软分层和混合架构，显著提升了数据准备的效率和效果。

Abstract: Data preparation is a foundational yet notoriously challenging component of
the machine learning lifecycle, characterized by a vast combinatorial search
space of potential operator sequences. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers
a promising direction, existing approaches are inefficient as they fail to
capture the structured, hierarchical nature of the problem. We argue that
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), a paradigm that has been successful
in other domains, provides a conceptually ideal yet previously unexplored
framework for this task. However, a naive HRL implementation with a `hard
hierarchy' is prone to suboptimal, irreversible decisions. To address this, we
introduce CogniQ-H, the first framework to implement a soft hierarchical
paradigm for robust, end-to-end automated data preparation. CogniQ-H formulates
action selection as a Bayesian inference problem. A high-level strategic prior,
generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), guides exploration
probabilistically. This prior is synergistically combined with a fine-grained
operator quality score from a supervised Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model and a
long-term value estimate from the agent's own Q-function. This hybrid
architecture allows CogniQ-H to balance strategic guidance with adaptive,
evidence-based decision-making. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse
datasets spanning multiple domains, we demonstrate that CogniQ-H achieves up to
13.9\% improvement in pipeline quality and 2.8$\times$ faster convergence
compared to state-of-the-art RL-based methods.

Result: ParallelTime在多个基准测试中表现优异，具有鲁棒性、低计算开销和高效扩展性。

Conclusion: ParallelTime为时间序列预测中的并行Attention-Mamba架构提供了有前景的发展方向。

Abstract: Modern multivariate time series forecasting primarily relies on two
architectures: the Transformer with attention mechanism and Mamba. In natural
language processing, an approach has been used that combines local window
attention for capturing short-term dependencies and Mamba for capturing
long-term dependencies, with their outputs averaged to assign equal weight to
both. We find that for time-series forecasting tasks, assigning equal weight to
long-term and short-term dependencies is not optimal. To mitigate this, we
propose a dynamic weighting mechanism, ParallelTime Weighter, which calculates
interdependent weights for long-term and short-term dependencies for each token
based on the input and the model's knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce the
ParallelTime architecture, which incorporates the ParallelTime Weighter
mechanism to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks.
Our architecture demonstrates robustness, achieves lower FLOPs, requires fewer
parameters, scales effectively to longer prediction horizons, and significantly
outperforms existing methods. These advances highlight a promising path for
future developments of parallel Attention-Mamba in time series forecasting. The

Motivation: To evaluate KANs' effectiveness in class-imbalanced classification and compare them with MLPs, highlighting their limitations and potential improvements.

Method: Empirical evaluation of KANs and MLPs on ten benchmark datasets, testing performance with and without imbalance strategies like resampling and focal loss.

Result: KANs perform well on raw imbalanced data but degrade with standard imbalance techniques. MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve similar performance at lower costs.

Conclusion: KANs are a specialized solution for raw imbalanced data but face performance-resource tradeoffs and incompatibility with standard techniques, requiring further research.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are recent architectural advancement in
neural computation that offer a mathematically grounded alternative to standard
neural networks. This study presents an empirical evaluation of KANs in context
of class imbalanced classification, using ten benchmark datasets. We observe
that KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively
than Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However,
conventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical
structure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade
KANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from
prohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains.
Statistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve
equivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs.
These findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw
imbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource
tradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently
limits practical deployment. We identify critical research priorities as
developing KAN specific architectural modifications for imbalance learning,
optimizing computational efficiency, and theoretical reconciling their conflict
with data augmentation. This work establishes foundational insights for next
generation KAN architectures in imbalanced classification scenarios.

Abstract: A grand challenge in modern neuroscience is to bridge the gap between the
detailed mapping of microscale neural circuits and a mechanistic understanding
of cognitive functions. While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal
connectivity and biophysics, a significant gap remains in how these elements
combine to produce flexible, learned behaviors. Here, we propose that a
framework based on State-Space Models (SSMs), an emerging class of deep
learning architectures, can bridge this gap. We argue that the differential
equations governing elements in an SSM are conceptually consistent with the
biophysical dynamics of neurons, while the combined dynamics in the model lead
to emergent behaviors observed in experimental neuroscience. We test this
framework by training an S5 model--a specific SSM variant employing a diagonal
state transition matrix--on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement
learning (RL). We demonstrate that the model spontaneously develops neural
representations that strikingly mimic biological 'time cells'. We reveal that
these cells emerge from a simple generative principle: learned rotational
dynamics of hidden state vectors in the complex plane. This single mechanism
unifies the emergence of time cells, ramping activity, and
oscillations/traveling waves observed in numerous experiments. Furthermore, we
show that this rotational dynamics generalizes beyond interval discriminative
tasks to abstract event-counting tasks that were considered foundational for
performing complex cognitive tasks. Our findings position SSMs as a compelling
framework that connects single-neuron dynamics to cognitive phenomena, offering
a unifying and computationally tractable theoretical ground for temporal
learning in the brain.

pluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives
through a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who
provided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication,
capturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm
demographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain,
revealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that
diverge from conventional evaluations. Finally, we discuss implications for
building aligned T2I models, including efficient data collection strategies,
LLM judgment capabilities, and model steerability towards diverse perspectives.
This research offers foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I

Abstract: Data normalization is crucial in machine learning, usually performed by
subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation, or by rescaling to a
fixed range. In copula theory, popular in finance, there is used normalization
to approximately quantiles by transforming x to CDF(x) with estimated CDF
(cumulative distribution function) to nearly uniform distribution in [0,1],
allowing for simpler representations which are less likely to overfit. It seems
nearly unknown in machine learning, therefore, we would like to present some
its advantages on example of recently popular Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

CDF normalization. Additionally, in HCR interpretation, weights of such neurons
are mixed moments providing local joint distribution models, allow to propagate

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized many industries by enabling models to
automatically learn complex patterns from raw data, reducing dependence on
manual feature engineering. However, deep learning algorithms are sensitive to
input data, and performance often deteriorates under nonstationary conditions
and across dissimilar domains, especially when using time-domain data.
Conventional single-channel or parallel multi-source data loading strategies
either limit generalization or increase computational costs. This study
introduces selective embedding, a novel data loading strategy, which alternates
short segments of data from multiple sources within a single input channel.
Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, selective embedding mimics
human-like information processing to reduce model overfitting, enhance
generalization, and improve computational efficiency. Validation is conducted
using six time-domain datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method
consistently achieves high classification accuracy across various deep learning
architectures while significantly reducing training times. The approach proves
particularly effective for complex systems with multiple data sources, offering
a scalable and resource-efficient solution for real-world applications in
healthcare, heavy machinery, marine, railway, and agriculture, where robustness

Abstract: Data-driven learning is generalized to consider history-dependent
multi-fidelity data, while quantifying epistemic uncertainty and disentangling
it from data noise (aleatoric uncertainty). This generalization is hierarchical
and adapts to different learning scenarios: from training the simplest
single-fidelity deterministic neural networks up to the proposed multi-fidelity
variance estimation Bayesian recurrent neural networks. The versatility and
generality of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by applying it to
different data-driven constitutive modeling scenarios that include multiple
fidelities with and without aleatoric uncertainty (noise). The method

Motivation: 解决GCN在大规模复杂图数据中的过平滑和过压缩问题，以及Graph Transformer在异构图数据中的性能限制。

Method: 结合GCN、AE和Graph Transformer，通过三学习机制和特征融合策略增强全局与局部信息的区分性和一致性。

Conclusion: Tri-GFN框架在自动新闻分类和主题检索等应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, models based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have made
significant strides in the field of graph data analysis. However, challenges
such as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale
and complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality.
Although the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues,
its performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To
address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework
that comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the
Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the
differentiation and consistency of global and local information through a
unique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The
framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components
are meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes
the use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust
clustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning
among these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to
capture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations
for graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an
accuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the
Reuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset. Due to its outstanding
performance on the Reuters dataset, Tri-GFN can be applied to automatic news
classification, topic retrieval, and related fields.

Conclusion: 预测引导的跳过策略是资源受限边缘环境中联邦学习的实用有效方法。

Abstract: Communication overhead remains a primary bottleneck in federated learning
(FL), particularly for applications involving mobile and IoT devices with
constrained bandwidth. This work introduces FedSkipTwin, a novel
client-skipping algorithm driven by lightweight, server-side digital twins.
Each twin, implemented as a simple LSTM, observes a client's historical
sequence of gradient norms to forecast both the magnitude and the epistemic
uncertainty of its next update. The server leverages these predictions,
requesting communication only when either value exceeds a predefined threshold;
otherwise, it instructs the client to skip the round, thereby saving bandwidth.
Experiments are conducted on the UCI-HAR and MNIST datasets with 10 clients
under a non-IID data distribution. The results demonstrate that FedSkipTwin
reduces total communication by 12-15.5% across 20 rounds while simultaneously
improving final model accuracy by up to 0.5 percentage points compared to the
standard FedAvg algorithm. These findings establish that prediction-guided
skipping is a practical and effective strategy for resource-aware FL in
bandwidth-constrained edge environments.

Abstract: Physics-inspired graph neural networks (PI-GNNs) have been utilized as an
efficient unsupervised framework for relaxing combinatorial optimization
problems encoded through a specific graph structure and loss, reflecting
dependencies between the problem's variables. While the framework has yielded
promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the
performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of
the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase
transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate
solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the
relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To
address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive
strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized
neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed
methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense
settings.

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) provides a principled framework
for navigating trade-offs in molecular design. However, its empirical
advantages over scalarized alternatives remain underexplored. We benchmark a
simple Pareto-based MOBO strategy -- Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) --
against a simple fixed-weight scalarized baseline using Expected Improvement
(EI), under a tightly controlled setup with identical Gaussian Process
surrogates and molecular representations. Across three molecular optimization
tasks, EHVI consistently outperforms scalarized EI in terms of Pareto front
coverage, convergence speed, and chemical diversity. While scalarization
encompasses flexible variants -- including random or adaptive schemes -- our
results show that even strong deterministic instantiations can underperform in
low-data regimes. These findings offer concrete evidence for the practical
advantages of Pareto-aware acquisition in de novo molecular optimization,
especially when evaluation budgets are limited and trade-offs are nontrivial.

Abstract: Simulating interactions between deformable bodies is vital in fields like
material science, mechanical design, and robotics. While learning-based methods
with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at solving complex physical
systems, they encounter scalability issues when modeling deformable body
interactions. To model interactions between objects, pairwise global edges have
to be created dynamically, which is computationally intensive and impractical
for large-scale meshes. To overcome these challenges, drawing on insights from
geometric representations, we propose an Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST)
method for efficient representation of physical states. By dividing the
simulation space into a grid of cells and mapping unstructured meshes onto this
structured grid, our approach naturally groups adjacent mesh nodes. We then
apply a cross-attention module to map the sparse cells into a compact,
fixed-length embedding, serving as tokens for the entire physical state.
Self-attention modules are employed to predict the next state over these tokens
in latent space. This framework leverages the efficiency of tokenization and
the expressive power of attention mechanisms to achieve accurate and scalable
simulation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in modeling deformable
body interactions. Notably, it remains effective on large-scale simulations
with meshes exceeding 100,000 nodes, where existing methods are hindered by
computational limitations. Additionally, we contribute a novel large-scale
dataset encompassing a wide range of deformable body interactions to support
future research in this area.

Abstract: Adversarial training is a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness
against adversarial attacks. However, its impact on generalization under
substantial data distribution shifts in audio classification remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, this work investigates how different
adversarial training strategies improve generalization performance and
adversarial robustness in audio classification. The study focuses on two model
architectures: a conventional convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt) and an
inherently interpretable prototype-based model (AudioProtoPNet). The approach
is evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This
benchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training
and test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a
common real-world challenge. The investigation explores two adversarial
training strategies: one based on output-space attacks that maximize the
classification loss function, and another based on embedding-space attacks
designed to maximize embedding dissimilarity. These attack types are also used
for robustness evaluation. Additionally, for AudioProtoPNet, the study assesses
the stability of its learned prototypes under targeted embedding-space attacks.
Results show that adversarial training, particularly using output-space
attacks, improves clean test data performance by an average of 10.5% relative
and simultaneously strengthens the adversarial robustness of the models. These
findings, although derived from the bird sound domain, suggest that adversarial
training holds potential to enhance robustness against both strong distribution
shifts and adversarial attacks in challenging audio classification settings.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in graph
classification tasks by capturing both structural and feature-based
representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit two critical forms of
imbalance: class imbalance and graph size imbalance. These imbalances can bias
the learning process and degrade model performance. Existing methods typically
address only one type of imbalance or incur high computational costs. In this
work, we propose SamGoG, a sampling-based Graph-of-Graphs (GoG) learning
framework that effectively mitigates both class and graph size imbalance.
SamGoG constructs multiple GoGs through an efficient importance-based sampling
mechanism and trains on them sequentially. This sampling mechanism incorporates
the learnable pairwise similarity and adaptive GoG node degree to enhance edge
homophily, thus improving downstream model quality. SamGoG can seamlessly
integrate with various downstream GNNs, enabling their efficient adaptation for
graph classification tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that SamGoG achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to a

Abstract: Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from
first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has
become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training
datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a
computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare
events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation
models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular
databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data
necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach
requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can
still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events
and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning.
In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely
automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the
model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with
classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying
this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to
assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even
though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In
this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach
based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow
that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified
accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them
at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex domains poses significant challenges due to the
need for extensive labeled data and the inherently imbalanced nature of
anomalous versus benign samples. Graph-based machine learning models have
emerged as a promising solution that combines attribute and relational data to
uncover intricate patterns. However, the scarcity of anomalous data exacerbates
the challenge, which requires innovative strategies to enhance model learning
with limited information. In this paper, we hypothesize that the incorporation
of the influence of the nodes, quantified through average controllability, can
significantly improve the performance of anomaly detection. We propose two
novel approaches to integrate average controllability into graph-based
frameworks: (1) using average controllability as an edge weight and (2)
encoding it as a one-hot edge attribute vector. Through rigorous evaluation on
real-world and synthetic networks with six state-of-the-art baselines, our
proposed methods demonstrate improved performance in identifying anomalies,
highlighting the critical role of controllability measures in enhancing the
performance of graph machine learning models. This work underscores the
potential of integrating average controllability as additional metrics to
address the challenges of anomaly detection in sparse and imbalanced datasets.

Method: 通过将重点从策略优化转移到策略评估，提出了两种最小化问题框架，并引入了“风险分配一致性约束”来解释评估错误。

Result: 发现约束集的交集为空是评估错误的根源，并证明了基于对偶CVaR分解的单一策略优化存在根本性限制。

Conclusion: 通过风险分配视角，揭示了静态CVaR优化的局限性，并证明在某些MDP中不存在对所有初始风险水平都最优的单一策略。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that dynamic programming (DP) methods for finding
static CVaR-optimal policies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can fail when
based on the dual formulation, yet the root cause for the failure has remained
unclear. We expand on these findings by shifting focus from policy optimization
to the seemingly simpler task of policy evaluation. We show that evaluating the
static CVaR of a given policy can be framed as two distinct minimization
problems. For their solutions to match, a set of ``risk-assignment consistency
constraints'' must be satisfied, and we demonstrate that the intersection of
the constraints being empty is the source of previously observed evaluation
errors. Quantifying the evaluation error as the CVaR evaluation gap, we then
demonstrate that the issues observed when optimizing over the dual-based CVaR
DP are explained by the returned policy having a non-zero CVaR evaluation gap.
We then leverage our proposed risk-assignment perspective to prove that the
search for a single, uniformly optimal policy via on the dual CVaR
decomposition is fundamentally limited, identifying an MDP where no single
policy can be optimal across all initial risk levels.

Conclusion: 增益调制机制模拟了去甲肾上腺素功能，为持续学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in
performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the
stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning,
revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably,
persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within
this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other
sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid
adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to
investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual
learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating
concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to
modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native
multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam
introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps.
Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently
enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we
propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that
approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of
knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We
evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of
the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that
uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap.
Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic
functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing
stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering
complex patterns in observational studies, which are often represented as
low-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are
high-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of
irregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is
critical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.
In this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the
transformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set
of latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that
integrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor
decomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks
using the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and
extracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design
to enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm
converges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in
theoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor
decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic
health record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both
phenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability
of causal representations.

expert-competitive design efficacy. Structural analysis further confirms their
mechanism-validated inhibitory patterns. By tracing the process of design, we

for lead compounds design, suggesting its potential utility in drug design.

TL;DR: FuSeFL是一种完全安全且可扩展的联邦学习方案，适用于跨机构设置，通过轻量级安全多方计算（MPC）实现高效训练，同时保护数据和模型的机密性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在隐私保护方面存在高计算、通信或内存开销问题，且忽视全局模型的机密性，限制了其在实际应用中的可行性。

Method: FuSeFL采用去中心化的客户端对训练方式，结合轻量级MPC，服务器仅负责安全聚合，避免了数据卸载和服务器瓶颈。

Result: FuSeFL显著降低了通信延迟（95%）和服务器内存使用（50%），同时提高了准确性，并在大规模应用中展示了强安全性和效率。

Conclusion: FuSeFL为跨机构联邦学习提供了一种高效、安全的解决方案，解决了现有方法在隐私保护和性能上的不足。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without
centralizing client data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains.
While existing approaches employ cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic
encryption, differential privacy, or secure multiparty computation to mitigate
inference attacks-including model inversion, membership inference, and gradient
leakage-they often suffer from high computational, communication, or memory
overheads. Moreover, many methods overlook the confidentiality of the global
model itself, which may be proprietary and sensitive. These challenges limit
the practicality of secure FL, especially in cross-silo deployments involving
large datasets and strict compliance requirements.
  We present FuSeFL, a fully secure and scalable FL scheme designed for
cross-silo settings. FuSeFL decentralizes training across client pairs using
lightweight secure multiparty computation (MPC), while confining the server's
role to secure aggregation. This design eliminates server bottlenecks, avoids
data offloading, and preserves full confidentiality of data, model, and updates
throughout training. FuSeFL defends against inference threats, achieves up to
95% lower communication latency and 50% lower server memory usage, and improves
accuracy over prior secure FL solutions, demonstrating strong security and
efficiency at scale.

Abstract: We consider the problem of contextual kernel bandits with stochastic
contexts, where the underlying reward function belongs to a known Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space. We study this problem under an additional constraint of
Differential Privacy, where the agent needs to ensure that the sequence of
query points is differentially private with respect to both the sequence of
contexts and rewards. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves the
state-of-the-art cumulative regret of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\gamma_TT}+\frac{\gamma_T}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}}})$
and
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\gamma_TT}+\frac{\gamma_T\sqrt{T}}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}}})$
over a time horizon of $T$ in the joint and local models of differential
privacy, respectively, where $\gamma_T$ is the effective dimension of the
kernel and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}} > 0$ is the privacy parameter. The key
ingredient of the proposed algorithm is a novel private kernel-ridge regression
estimator which is based on a combination of private covariance estimation and
private random projections. It offers a significantly reduced sensitivity
compared to its classical counterpart while maintaining a high prediction
accuracy, allowing our algorithm to achieve the state-of-the-art performance
guarantees.

Result: 证明了效用差距的固有性，并提出了一种匹配不可能性结果的简化算法。

Conclusion: 当前集中查询框架在自适应设置中存在固有局限性，简化算法验证了这一点。

Abstract: Most work on adaptive data analysis assumes that samples in the dataset are
independent. When correlations are allowed, even the non-adaptive setting can
become intractable, unless some structural constraints are imposed. To address
this, Bassily and Freund [2016] introduced the elegant framework of
concentrated queries, which requires the analyst to restrict itself to queries
that are concentrated around their expected value. While this assumption makes
the problem trivial in the non-adaptive setting, in the adaptive setting it
remains quite challenging. In fact, all known algorithms in this framework
support significantly fewer queries than in the independent case: At most
$O(n)$ queries for a sample of size $n$, compared to $O(n^2)$ in the
independent setting.
  In this work, we prove that this utility gap is inherent under the current
formulation of the concentrated queries framework, assuming some natural
conditions on the algorithm. Additionally, we present a simplified version of
the best-known algorithms that match our impossibility result.

Result: 在多种协作学习场景中验证了方法的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 共形数据污染测试是一种通用的数据聚合方法，具有统计上严格的质量保证。

Abstract: The amount of quality data in many machine learning tasks is limited to what
is available locally to data owners. The set of quality data can be expanded
through trading or sharing with external data agents. However, data buyers need
quality guarantees before purchasing, as external data may be contaminated or
irrelevant to their specific learning task. Previous works primarily rely on
distributional assumptions about data from different agents, relegating quality
checks to post-hoc steps involving costly data valuation procedures. We propose
a distribution-free, contamination-aware data-sharing framework that identifies
external data agents whose data is most valuable for model personalization. To
achieve this, we introduce novel two-sample testing procedures, grounded in
rigorous theoretical foundations for conformal outlier detection, to determine
whether an agent's data exceeds a contamination threshold. The proposed tests,
termed conformal data contamination tests, remain valid under arbitrary
contamination levels while enabling false discovery rate control via the
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Empirical evaluations across diverse
collaborative learning scenarios demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our approach. Overall, the conformal data contamination test distinguishes
itself as a generic procedure for aggregating data with statistically rigorous
quality guarantees.

Method: 将维度估计方法分为三类：基于局部仿射结构的切向估计器、依赖维度相关概率分布的参数估计器，以及利用拓扑或度量不变性的估计器。

Result: 评估了这些方法的性能，发现许多估计器在基准数据集上容易过拟合，泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 需要更可靠的维度估计方法，尤其是在高维和非线性几何数据上。

Abstract: It is a standard assumption that datasets in high dimension have an internal
structure which means that they in fact lie on, or near, subsets of a lower
dimension. In many instances it is important to understand the real dimension
of the data, hence the complexity of the dataset at hand. A great variety of
dimension estimators have been developed to find the intrinsic dimension of the
data but there is little guidance on how to reliably use these estimators.
  This survey reviews a wide range of dimension estimation methods,
categorising them by the geometric information they exploit: tangential
estimators which detect a local affine structure; parametric estimators which
rely on dimension-dependent probability distributions; and estimators which use
topological or metric invariants.
  The paper evaluates the performance of these methods, as well as
investigating varying responses to curvature and noise. Key issues addressed
include robustness to hyperparameter selection, sample size requirements,
accuracy in high dimensions, precision, and performance on non-linear
geometries. In identifying the best hyperparameters for benchmark datasets,
overfitting is frequent, indicating that many estimators may not generalise
well beyond the datasets on which they have been tested.

Result: Soft-ECM在数值数据上与模糊聚类方法效果相当，并能处理混合数据和时间序列（如使用DTW）。

Conclusion: Soft-ECM扩展了信念函数聚类的适用性，为复杂数据提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Clustering based on belief functions has been gaining increasing attention in
the machine learning community due to its ability to effectively represent
uncertainty and/or imprecision. However, none of the existing algorithms can be
applied to complex data, such as mixed data (numerical and categorical) or
non-tabular data like time series. Indeed, these types of data are, in general,
not represented in a Euclidean space and the aforementioned algorithms make use
of the properties of such spaces, in particular for the construction of
barycenters. In this paper, we reformulate the Evidential C-Means (ECM) problem
for clustering complex data. We propose a new algorithm, Soft-ECM, which
consistently positions the centroids of imprecise clusters requiring only a
semi-metric. Our experiments show that Soft-ECM present results comparable to
conventional fuzzy clustering approaches on numerical data, and we demonstrate
its ability to handle mixed data and its benefits when combining fuzzy
clustering with semi-metrics such as DTW for time series data.

Conclusion: 该工具能够将任务需求归因于特定飞机，为控制器培训和空域重新设计提供了新的分析手段。

Abstract: Real-time assessment of near-term Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) task demand
is a critical challenge in an increasingly crowded airspace, as existing
complexity metrics often fail to capture nuanced operational drivers beyond
simple aircraft counts. This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural
Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts
the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by
ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive
an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating
aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework
significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable
estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool
can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse
and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller
training and airspace redesign.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable inertial sensors plays a
critical role in remote health monitoring. In patients with movement disorders,
the ability to detect abnormal patient movements in their home environments can
enable continuous optimization of treatments and help alert caretakers as
needed. Machine learning approaches have been proposed for HAR tasks using
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data; however, most rely on
application-specific labels and lack generalizability to data collected in
different environments or populations. To address this limitation, we propose a
new cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to learn representations
from large-sale unlabeled IMU-video data and demonstrate improved
generalizability in HAR tasks on out of distribution (OOD) IMU datasets,
including a dataset collected from patients with Parkinson's disease.
Specifically, our results indicate that the proposed cross-modal pretraining
approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art IMU-video pretraining
approach and IMU-only pretraining under zero-shot and few-shot evaluations.
Broadly, our study provides evidence that in highly dynamic data modalities,
such as IMU signals, cross-modal pretraining may be a useful tool to learn
generalizable data representations. Our software is available at

Result: 在736名患者的队列中，Acoustic Index的AUC达到0.89，交叉验证显示敏感性和特异性均超过0.8。

Conclusion: Acoustic Index是一种物理信息驱动的可解释AI生物标志物，具有早期检测和纵向监测的潜力。

Abstract: Traditional echocardiographic parameters such as ejection fraction (EF) and
global longitudinal strain (GLS) have limitations in the early detection of
cardiac dysfunction. EF often remains normal despite underlying pathology, and
GLS is influenced by load conditions and vendor variability. There is a growing
need for reproducible, interpretable, and operator-independent parameters that
capture subtle and global cardiac functional alterations.
  We introduce the Acoustic Index, a novel AI-derived echocardiographic
parameter designed to quantify cardiac dysfunction from standard ultrasound
views. The model combines Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) based on
Koopman operator theory with a hybrid neural network that incorporates clinical
metadata. Spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from echocardiographic
sequences to identify coherent motion patterns. These are weighted via
attention mechanisms and fused with clinical data using manifold learning,
resulting in a continuous score from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).
  In a prospective cohort of 736 patients, encompassing various cardiac
pathologies and normal controls, the Acoustic Index achieved an area under the
curve (AUC) of 0.89 in an independent test set. Cross-validation across five
folds confirmed the robustness of the model, showing that both sensitivity and
specificity exceeded 0.8 when evaluated on independent data. Threshold-based
analysis demonstrated stable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity,
with optimal discrimination near this threshold.
  The Acoustic Index represents a physics-informed, interpretable AI biomarker
for cardiac function. It shows promise as a scalable, vendor-independent tool
for early detection, triage, and longitudinal monitoring. Future directions
include external validation, longitudinal studies, and adaptation to
disease-specific classifiers.

Result: 实验表明，这两种指标能准确反映时间序列的固有可预测性，并与多种模型的预测性能高度相关。

Conclusion: 通过提前评估数据的可预测性，实践者可以更高效地分配资源，并为低可预测性的数据制定替代策略。

Abstract: This paper proposes using two metrics to quantify the forecastability of time
series prior to model development: the spectral predictability score and the
largest Lyapunov exponent. Unlike traditional model evaluation metrics, these
measures assess the inherent forecastability characteristics of the data before
any forecast attempts. The spectral predictability score evaluates the strength
and regularity of frequency components in the time series, whereas the Lyapunov
exponents quantify the chaos and stability of the system generating the data.
We evaluated the effectiveness of these metrics on both synthetic and
real-world time series from the M5 forecast competition dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these two metrics can correctly reflect the inherent
forecastability of a time series and have a strong correlation with the actual
forecast performance of various models. By understanding the inherent
forecastability of time series before model training, practitioners can focus
their planning efforts on products and supply chain levels that are more
forecastable, while setting appropriate expectations or seeking alternative
strategies for products with limited forecastability.

Conclusion: DiPS和DPR为匹配市场提供高效可靠的OPE方法，支持离线政策优化。

Abstract: Matching users based on mutual preferences is a fundamental aspect of
services driven by reciprocal recommendations, such as job search and dating
applications. Although A/B tests remain the gold standard for evaluating new
policies in recommender systems for matching markets, it is costly and
impractical for frequent policy updates. Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) thus plays
a crucial role by enabling the evaluation of recommendation policies using only
offline logged data naturally collected on the platform. However, unlike
conventional recommendation settings, the large scale and bidirectional nature
of user interactions in matching platforms introduce variance issues and
exacerbate reward sparsity, making standard OPE methods unreliable. To address
these challenges and facilitate effective offline evaluation, we propose novel
OPE estimators, \textit{DiPS} and \textit{DPR}, specifically designed for
matching markets. Our methods combine elements of the Direct Method (DM),
Inverse Propensity Score (IPS), and Doubly Robust (DR) estimators while
incorporating intermediate labels, such as initial engagement signals, to
achieve better bias-variance control in matching markets. Theoretically, we
derive the bias and variance of the proposed estimators and demonstrate their
advantages over conventional methods. Furthermore, we show that these
estimators can be seamlessly extended to offline policy learning methods for
improving recommendation policies for making more matches. We empirically
evaluate our methods through experiments on both synthetic data and A/B testing
logs from a real job-matching platform. The empirical results highlight the
superiority of our approach over existing methods in off-policy evaluation and
learning tasks for a variety of configurations.

fusion framework is constructed, using Word2Vec encoding to encode
subsystem/component features, BERT-KPCA to process failure modes/reasons, and
Sentence-BERT to quantify the semantic association between failure impact and
emergency decision-making. The dataset covers 12 systems, 1,262 failure modes,
and 6,150 propagation paths. Validation results show that the GATE-GNN model
achieves a classification accuracy of 0.735, comparable to existing benchmarks.
Additionally, a silhouette coefficient of 0.641 indicates that the features are
highly distinguishable. In the label prediction results, the Shore-based
Meteorological Service System achieved an F1 score of 0.93, demonstrating high
prediction accuracy. This paper not only provides a solid foundation for

Abstract: Graph clustering is crucial for unraveling intricate data structures, yet it
presents significant challenges due to its unsupervised nature. Recently,
goal-directed clustering techniques have yielded impressive results, with
contrastive learning methods leveraging pseudo-label garnering considerable
attention. Nonetheless, pseudo-label as a supervision signal is unreliable and
existing goal-directed approaches utilize only features to construct a
single-target distribution for single-center optimization, which lead to
incomplete and less dependable guidance. In our work, we propose a novel
Dual-Center Graph Clustering (DCGC) approach based on neighbor distribution
properties, which includes representation learning with neighbor distribution
and dual-center optimization. Specifically, we utilize neighbor distribution as
a supervision signal to mine hard negative samples in contrastive learning,
which is reliable and enhances the effectiveness of representation learning.
Furthermore, neighbor distribution center is introduced alongside feature
center to jointly construct a dual-target distribution for dual-center
optimization. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate superior
performance and effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from gene expression data is a crucial task in
biomedical research, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses,
and personalized medicine. Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely
on supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that
are costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data.
Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to
overcome these limitations by extracting information directly from the
structure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of
state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data
for phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on
different approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure
of the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for
downstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene
expression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively
capture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The
results obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform
traditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by
reducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis
of the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and
limitations. We also provide recommendations for using these methods depending
on the case under study. Finally, we outline future research directions to
enhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene
expression data analysis. This study is the first work that deals with bulk
RNA-Seq data and self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Extensively exploring protein conformational landscapes remains a major
challenge in computational biology due to the high computational cost involved
in dynamic physics-based simulations. In this work, we propose a novel
pipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational
spaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into
MD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble
learning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of
generated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative
representation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into
2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use
three rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new
conformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that
interpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained
from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that
representing proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying
advanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an
efficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed
framework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures.

Abstract: The work in this paper describes the training and evaluation of machine
learning (ML) techniques for the classification of cuneiform signs. There is a
lot of variability in cuneiform signs, depending on where they come from, for
what and by whom they were written, but also how they were digitized. This
variability makes it unlikely that an ML model trained on one dataset will
perform successfully on another dataset. This contribution studies how such
differences impact that performance. Based on our results and insights, we aim
to influence future data acquisition standards and provide a solid foundation
for future cuneiform sign classification tasks. The ML model has been trained
and tested on handwritten Old Babylonian (c. 2000-1600 B.C.E.) documentary
texts inscribed on clay tablets originating from three Mesopotamian cities
(Nippur, D\=ur-Abie\v{s}uh and Sippar). The presented and analysed model is
ResNet50, which achieves a top-1 score of 87.1% and a top-5 score of 96.5% for
signs with at least 20 instances. As these automatic classification results are
the first on Old Babylonian texts, there are currently no comparable results.

Abstract: Small sample sizes in neuroimaging in general, and in structural connectome
(SC) studies in particular limit the development of reliable biomarkers for
neurological and psychiatric disorders - such as Alzheimer's disease and
schizophrenia - by reducing statistical power, reliability, and
generalizability. Large-scale multi-site studies have exist, but they have
acquisition-related biases due to scanner heterogeneity, compromising imaging
consistency and downstream analyses. While existing SC harmonization methods -
such as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate
these biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or
overlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a
site-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across
diverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a
simulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this
framework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected
autoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a
top-performing LR baseline. While non-graph models excel in edge-weight
prediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior
preservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as
reflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively. Although
the LR baseline achieves the highest numerical performance by explicitly
modeling acquisition parameters, it lacks applicability to real-world
multi-site use cases as detailed acquisition metadata is often unavailable. Our
results highlight the critical role of model architecture in SC harmonization
performance and demonstrate that graph-based approaches are particularly
well-suited for structure-aware, domain-generalizable SC harmonization in
large-scale multi-site SC studies.

Abstract: In this paper, we study Byzantine-resilient federated online learning for
Gaussian process regression (GPR). We develop a Byzantine-resilient federated
GPR algorithm that allows a cloud and a group of agents to collaboratively
learn a latent function and improve the learning performances where some agents
exhibit Byzantine failures, i.e., arbitrary and potentially adversarial
behavior. Each agent-based local GPR sends potentially compromised local
predictions to the cloud, and the cloud-based aggregated GPR computes a global
model by a Byzantine-resilient product of experts aggregation rule. Then the
cloud broadcasts the current global model to all the agents. Agent-based fused
GPR refines local predictions by fusing the received global model with that of
the agent-based local GPR. Moreover, we quantify the learning accuracy
improvements of the agent-based fused GPR over the agent-based local GPR.
Experiments on a toy example and two medium-scale real-world datasets are
conducted to demonstrate the performances of the proposed algorithm.

practice rank may grow. In this paper we develop asymptotic analysis for the
case of growing rank.

Abstract: Physics-guided approaches offer a promising path toward accurate and
generalisable impact identification in composite structures, especially when
experimental data are sparse. This paper presents a hybrid framework for impact
localisation and force estimation in composite plates, combining a data-driven
implementation of First-Order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) with machine
learning and uncertainty quantification. The structural configuration and
material properties are inferred from dispersion relations, while boundary
conditions are identified via modal characteristics to construct a low-fidelity
but physically consistent FSDT model. This model enables physics-informed data
augmentation for extrapolative localisation using supervised learning.
Simultaneously, an adaptive regularisation scheme derived from the same model
improves the robustness of impact force reconstruction. The framework also
accounts for uncertainty by propagating localisation uncertainty through the
force estimation process, producing probabilistic outputs. Validation on
composite plate experiments confirms the framework's accuracy, robustness, and
efficiency in reducing dependence on large training datasets. The proposed
method offers a scalable and transferable solution for impact monitoring and
structural health management in composite aerostructures.

Abstract: Regression problems with bounded continuous outcomes frequently arise in
real-world statistical and machine learning applications, such as the analysis
of rates and proportions. A central challenge in this setting is predicting a
response associated with a new covariate value. Most of the existing
statistical and machine learning literature has focused either on point
prediction of bounded outcomes or on interval prediction based on asymptotic
approximations. We develop conformal prediction intervals for bounded outcomes
based on transformation models and beta regression. We introduce tailored
non-conformity measures based on residuals that are aligned with the underlying
models, and account for the inherent heteroscedasticity in regression settings
with bounded outcomes. We present a theoretical result on asymptotic marginal
and conditional validity in the context of full conformal prediction, which
remains valid under model misspecification. For split conformal prediction, we
provide an empirical coverage analysis based on a comprehensive simulation
study. The simulation study demonstrates that both methods provide valid
finite-sample predictive coverage, including settings with model
misspecification. Finally, we demonstrate the practical performance of the
proposed conformal prediction intervals on real data and compare them with
bootstrap-based alternatives.

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, which extracts unique hardware
imperfections of radio devices, has emerged as a promising physical-layer
device identification mechanism in zero trust architectures and beyond 5G
networks. In particular, deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in this domain. However, existing approaches have
primarily focused on enhancing system robustness against temporal and spatial
variations in wireless environments, while the security vulnerabilities of
these DL-based approaches have often been overlooked. In this work, we
systematically investigate the security risks of DL-based RF fingerprinting
systems through an adversarial-driven experimental analysis. We observe a
consistent misclassification behavior for DL models under domain shifts, where
a device is frequently misclassified as another specific one. Our analysis
based on extensive real-world experiments demonstrates that this behavior can
be exploited as an effective backdoor to enable external attackers to intrude
into the system. Furthermore, we show that training DL models on raw received
signals causes the models to entangle RF fingerprints with environmental and
signal-pattern features, creating additional attack vectors that cannot be
mitigated solely through post-processing security methods such as confidence
thresholds.

Abstract: Exploiting the fact that samples drawn from a quantum annealer inherently
follow a Boltzmann-like distribution, annealing-based Quantum Boltzmann
Machines (QBMs) have gained increasing popularity in the quantum research
community. While they harbor great promises for quantum speed-up, their usage
currently stays a costly endeavor, as large amounts of QPU time are required to
train them. This limits their applicability in the NISQ era. Following the idea
of No\`e et al. (2024), who tried to alleviate this cost by incorporating
parallel quantum annealing into their unsupervised training of QBMs, this paper
presents an improved version of parallel quantum annealing that we employ to
train QBMs in a supervised setting. Saving qubits to encode the inputs, the
latter setting allows us to test our approach on medical images from the
MedMNIST data set (Yang et al., 2023), thereby moving closer to real-world
applicability of the technology. Our experiments show that QBMs using our
approach already achieve reasonable results, comparable to those of
similarly-sized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with markedly smaller
numbers of epochs than these classical models. Our parallel annealing technique
leads to a speed-up of almost 70 % compared to regular annealing-based BM
executions.

Abstract: Coherent X-ray scattering techniques are critical for investigating the
fundamental structural properties of materials at the nanoscale. While
advancements have made these experiments more accessible, real-time analysis
remains a significant bottleneck, often hindered by artifacts and computational
demands. In scanning X-ray nanodiffraction microscopy, which is widely used to
spatially resolve structural heterogeneities, this challenge is compounded by
the convolution of the divergent beam with the sample's local structure. To
address this, we introduce DONUT (Diffraction with Optics for Nanobeam by
Unsupervised Training), a physics-aware neural network designed for the rapid
and automated analysis of nanobeam diffraction data. By incorporating a
differentiable geometric diffraction model directly into its architecture,
DONUT learns to predict crystal lattice strain and orientation in real-time.
Crucially, this is achieved without reliance on labeled datasets or
pre-training, overcoming a fundamental limitation for supervised machine
learning in X-ray science. We demonstrate experimentally that DONUT accurately
extracts all features within the data over 200 times more efficiently than
conventional fitting methods.
