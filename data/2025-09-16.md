### [1] [Uncovering the Vulnerability of Large Language Models in the Financial Domain via Risk Concealment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10546)
*Gang Cheng,Haibo Jin,Wenbin Zhang,Haohan Wang,Jun Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 85.0

TL;DR: 本文提出了Risk-Concealment Attacks (RCA)框架，通过多轮对话隐藏监管风险来诱导金融LLMs生成看似合规但实际违规的回复，在FIN-Bench基准测试中平均攻击成功率达到93.18%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队测试主要针对有害内容，忽视了金融领域的监管风险，需要研究金融LLMs在监管合规方面的脆弱性。

Method: 提出了RCA多轮攻击框架，构建了FIN-Bench金融安全评估基准，对9个主流LLMs进行系统性评估。

Result: RCA攻击平均成功率为93.18%，其中GPT-4.1达到98.28%，OpenAI o1达到97.56%，揭示了当前对齐技术的严重缺陷。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在金融领域存在重大安全漏洞，需要更强的领域感知对齐机制和审核机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into financial
applications, yet existing red-teaming research primarily targets harmful
content, largely neglecting regulatory risks. In this work, we aim to
investigate the vulnerability of financial LLMs through red-teaming approaches.
We introduce Risk-Concealment Attacks (RCA), a novel multi-turn framework that
iteratively conceals regulatory risks to provoke seemingly compliant yet
regulatory-violating responses from LLMs. To enable systematic evaluation, we
construct FIN-Bench, a domain-specific benchmark for assessing LLM safety in
financial contexts. Extensive experiments on FIN-Bench demonstrate that RCA
effectively bypasses nine mainstream LLMs, achieving an average attack success
rate (ASR) of 93.18%, including 98.28% on GPT-4.1 and 97.56% on OpenAI o1.
These findings reveal a critical gap in current alignment techniques and
underscore the urgent need for stronger moderation mechanisms in financial
domains. We hope this work offers practical insights for advancing robust and
domain-aware LLM alignment.

TL;DR: 该研究通过提取LLM在回答问题前的激活状态，训练线性探针来预测模型即将生成的答案是否正确，发现这种"提前正确性方向"在不同分布和知识数据集上都有良好的预测能力，且自我评估能力在中间层达到饱和。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否能够预测自己回答的正确性，通过分析模型在生成答案前的内部激活状态来探索LLM的自我评估能力。

Method: 在三个开源模型家族（7B到70B参数）上，提取问题读取后但答案生成前的激活状态，训练线性探针来预测即将生成的答案是否正确，使用通用琐事问题进行训练并在不同分布数据集上测试。

Result: 线性探针在分布内和分布外知识数据集上都表现出良好的预测能力，优于黑盒基线和语言化置信度预测。预测能力在中间层达到饱和，数学推理问题上的泛化能力较差，模型说"我不知道"时与探针得分高度相关。

Conclusion: LLM在中间计算层就形成了自我评估能力，相同的内部方向既能预测正确性也能捕捉置信度，为理解LLM内部机制提供了重要发现。

Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) anticipate when they will answer correctly?
To study this, we extract activations after a question is read but before any
tokens are generated, and train linear probes to predict whether the model's
forthcoming answer will be correct. Across three open-source model families
ranging from 7 to 70 billion parameters, projections on this "in-advance
correctness direction" trained on generic trivia questions predict success in
distribution and on diverse out-of-distribution knowledge datasets,
outperforming black-box baselines and verbalised predicted confidence.
Predictive power saturates in intermediate layers, suggesting that
self-assessment emerges mid-computation. Notably, generalisation falters on
questions requiring mathematical reasoning. Moreover, for models responding "I
don't know", doing so strongly correlates with the probe score, indicating that
the same direction also captures confidence. By complementing previous results
on truthfulness and other behaviours obtained with probes and sparse
auto-encoders, our work contributes essential findings to elucidate LLM
internals.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现熵神经元在LLMs处理上下文与参数知识冲突时抑制上下文复制行为，消融这些神经元会显著改变生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在面对与内部参数知识冲突的上下文信息时行为不一致，缺乏对预期结果分布的统一解释。最近研究发现自回归Transformer中存在一类熵神经元，它们对模型输出熵有显著影响但对预测token排名影响适中。本文旨在验证这些神经元是否参与抑制上下文复制行为。

Method: 通过研究熵神经元在解决上下文信息与参数知识冲突中的作用，分析这些神经元在不同LLMs中的功能，并进行神经元消融实验来观察生成过程的变化。

Result: 研究表明熵神经元确实负责抑制上下文复制行为，消融这些神经元会导致生成过程发生显著变化，证实了它们在处理冲突信息中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 这些发现增强了我们对LLMs在处理冲突信息时内部动态机制的理解，为模型可解释性研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) when facing contextual
information that conflicts with their internal parametric knowledge is
inconsistent, with no generally accepted explanation for the expected outcome
distribution. Recent work has identified in autoregressive transformer models a
class of neurons -- called entropy neurons -- that produce a significant effect
on the model output entropy while having an overall moderate impact on the
ranking of the predicted tokens. In this paper, we investigate the preliminary
claim that these neurons are involved in inhibiting context copying behavior in
transformers by looking at their role in resolving conflicts between contextual
and parametric information. We show that entropy neurons are responsible for
suppressing context copying across a range of LLMs, and that ablating them
leads to a significant change in the generation process. These results enhance
our understanding of the internal dynamics of LLMs when handling conflicting
information.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their remarkable capabilities in text generation and reasoning. However,
these models face critical challenges when deployed in real-world applications,
including hallucination generation, outdated knowledge, and limited domain
expertise. Retrieval And Structuring (RAS) Augmented Generation addresses these
limitations by integrating dynamic information retrieval with structured
knowledge representations. This survey (1) examines retrieval mechanisms
including sparse, dense, and hybrid approaches for accessing external
knowledge; (2) explore text structuring techniques such as taxonomy
construction, hierarchical classification, and information extraction that
transform unstructured text into organized representations; and (3) investigate
how these structured representations integrate with LLMs through prompt-based
methods, reasoning frameworks, and knowledge embedding techniques. It also
identifies technical challenges in retrieval efficiency, structure quality, and
knowledge integration, while highlighting research opportunities in multimodal
retrieval, cross-lingual structures, and interactive systems. This
comprehensive overview provides researchers and practitioners with insights
into RAS methods, applications, and future directions.

Motivation: 为特定领域创建合适的SFT训练数据集具有挑战性，因为存在独特的领域约束和数据稀缺问题。现有方法难以生成高质量、多样化的指令-响应对。

Method: 从少量人工生成的领域特定问题开始，使用大语言模型系统性地扩展问题，然后动态检索领域相关资源为每个扩展问题生成准确且上下文适当的答案。

Result: 实验评估表明SearchInstruct提高了SFT数据集的多样性和质量，在专业领域带来了可衡量的LLM性能改进，还能有效促进模型编辑等任务。

Conclusion: SearchInstruct为构建高质量SFT数据集提供了有效解决方案，解决了领域特定数据稀缺问题，并展示了在模型更新方面的额外应用价值。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is essential for training large language models
(LLMs), significantly enhancing critical capabilities such as instruction
following and in-context learning. Nevertheless, creating suitable training
datasets tailored for specific domains remains challenging due to unique domain
constraints and data scarcity. In this paper, we propose SearchInstruct, an
innovative method explicitly designed to construct high quality instruction
datasets for SFT. Our approach begins with a limited set of domain specific,
human generated questions, which are systematically expanded using a large
language model. Subsequently, domain relevant resources are dynamically
retrieved to generate accurate and contextually appropriate answers for each
augmented question. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SearchInstruct
enhances both the diversity and quality of SFT datasets, leading to measurable
improvements in LLM performance within specialized domains. Additionally, we
show that beyond dataset generation, the proposed method can also effectively
facilitate tasks such as model editing, enabling efficient updates to existing
models. To facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we provide full
implementation details, the complete set of generated instruction response
pairs, and the source code in a publicly accessible Git repository:

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在语言理解和生成方面取得广泛成功，但在需要概率推理的任务中表现出不明确且不一致的行为，需要系统评估其概率推理能力

Method: 通过三个精心设计的任务（模式识别、最大似然估计和样本生成）来评估模型，使用提示让模型回答关于联合分布或其条件分布的查询，测试频率分析、边缘化和生成行为等概率技能

Result: 发现小模型和大模型之间存在明显的性能差距，大模型展现出更强的推理能力和令人惊讶的样本生成能力，但也存在对概率结果表示符号变化的敏感性，以及随着上下文长度增加性能下降超过60%的显著限制

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了对LLMs概率推理能力的详细理解，并确定了未来改进的关键方向

Abstract: Despite widespread success in language understanding and generation, large
language models (LLMs) exhibit unclear and often inconsistent behavior when
faced with tasks that require probabilistic reasoning. In this work, we present
the first comprehensive study of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs over
explicit discrete probability distributions. Given observations from a
probability distribution, we evaluate models on three carefully designed tasks,
mode identification, maximum likelihood estimation, and sample generation, by
prompting them to provide responses to queries about either the joint
distribution or its conditionals. These tasks thus probe a range of
probabilistic skills, including frequency analysis, marginalization, and
generative behavior. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations, we
demonstrate that there exists a clear performance gap between smaller and
larger models, with the latter demonstrating stronger inference and surprising
capabilities in sample generation. Furthermore, our investigations reveal
notable limitations, including sensitivity to variations in the notation
utilized to represent probabilistic outcomes and performance degradation of
over 60% as context length increases. Together, our results provide a detailed
understanding of the probabilistic reasoning abilities of LLMs and identify key
directions for future improvement.

Conclusion: 自动化基准生成框架可扩展且有效，推理轨迹检索是提升小模型科学问答性能的有效方法，为持续更新科学评测基准提供了可行方案

Abstract: As scientific knowledge grows at an unprecedented pace, evaluation benchmarks
must evolve to reflect new discoveries and ensure language models are tested on
current, diverse literature. We propose a scalable, modular framework for
generating multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) benchmarks directly from
large corpora of scientific papers. Our pipeline automates every stage of MCQA
creation, including PDF parsing, semantic chunking, question generation, and
model evaluation. As a case study, we generate more than 16,000 MCQs from
22,000 open-access articles in radiation and cancer biology. We then evaluate a
suite of small language models (1.1B-14B parameters) on these questions,
comparing baseline accuracy with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from
paper-derived semantic chunks and from reasoning traces distilled from GPT-4.1.
We find that reasoning-trace retrieval consistently improves performance on
both synthetic and expert-annotated benchmarks, enabling several small models
to surpass GPT-4 on the 2023 Astro Radiation and Cancer Biology exam.

Motivation: 当前KV缓存淘汰方法过度关注局部信息，可能忽略重要的全局信息，导致内存使用和解码效率问题。

Method: 提出Judge Q训练方法，在输入序列末尾拼接软令牌列表，仅微调嵌入层，训练软令牌的注意力图与实际解码令牌对齐，从而有效捕获全局信息评估KV重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法能以极低训练成本无缝集成到现有开源模型中，提升KV缓存淘汰场景下的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) utilize key-value (KV) cache to store historical
information during sequence processing. The size of KV cache grows linearly as
the length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and
decoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize
the last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV
importance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it
tends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect
or omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Judge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This
method only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By
concatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train
these tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that
of the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the
soft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the
importance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining
decoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our
method exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction
approaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models
such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks
including LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Results indicate an
improvement of approximately 1 point on the LongBench and over 3 points on
RULER. This proposed methodology can be seamlessly integrated into existing
open-source models with minimal training overhead, thereby enhancing
performance in KV cache eviction scenarios.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的对话代理虽然流畅连贯，但仍会产生不良行为错误，且现有LLM难以检测指令中未明确指定的错误（如模型更新或用户行为变化带来的新错误）

Method: 提出SEEED方法：基于编码器的软聚类扩展错误检测，改进软最近邻损失以增强负样本距离权重，引入基于标签的样本排序来选择高对比度样本以改善表示学习

Conclusion: SEEED框架能有效检测对话AI中的未知错误，解决了现有LLM在错误检测方面的局限性，具有重要的实际应用价值

Abstract: Although LLM-based conversational agents demonstrate strong fluency and
coherence, they still produce undesirable behaviors (errors) that are
challenging to prevent from reaching users during deployment. Recent research
leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect errors and guide
response-generation models toward improvement. However, current LLMs struggle
to identify errors not explicitly specified in their instructions, such as
those arising from updates to the response-generation model or shifts in user
behavior. In this work, we introduce Automated Error Discovery, a framework for
detecting and defining errors in conversational AI, and propose SEEED (Soft
Clustering Extended Encoder-Based Error Detection), as an encoder-based
approach to its implementation. We enhance the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss by
amplifying distance weighting for negative samples and introduce Label-Based
Sample Ranking to select highly contrastive examples for better representation
learning. SEEED outperforms adapted baselines -- including GPT-4o and Phi-4 --
across multiple error-annotated dialogue datasets, improving the accuracy for
detecting unknown errors by up to 8 points and demonstrating strong
generalization to unknown intent detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在生物医学和临床应用中取得显著进展，需要严格评估其回答细致、基于证据的临床问题的能力，以了解当前的知识获取水平和模型性能的局限性。

Method: 从Cochrane系统评价和临床指南中构建多源基准数据集，使用GPT-4o-mini和GPT-5进行测试。采用检索增强提示策略，提供金标准摘要或PubMed相关摘要来评估模型性能。分析准确率与系统评价引用次数的相关性。

Result: 模型在结构化指南上准确率达90%，在叙述性指南和系统评价问题上为60-70%。引用次数每翻倍，正确回答几率增加约30%。检索增强提示显著提升性能：提供金标准摘要准确率达0.79，提供相关PubMed摘要准确率0.23，随机摘要降低性能(0.10)。

Conclusion: LLMs在循证临床问答中显示出潜力但仍有局限。检索增强提示是提高事实准确性和与源证据对齐的有效策略。需要按专业和问题类型进行分层评估来理解当前知识获取水平。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress in
biomedical and clinical applications, motivating rigorous evaluation of their
ability to answer nuanced, evidence-based questions. We curate a multi-source
benchmark drawing from Cochrane systematic reviews and clinical guidelines,
including structured recommendations from the American Heart Association and
narrative guidance used by insurers. Using GPT-4o-mini and GPT-5, we observe
consistent performance patterns across sources and clinical domains: accuracy
is highest on structured guideline recommendations (90%) and lower on narrative
guideline and systematic review questions (60--70%). We also find a strong
correlation between accuracy and the citation count of the underlying
systematic reviews, where each doubling of citations is associated with roughly
a 30% increase in the odds of a correct answer. Models show moderate ability to
reason about evidence quality when contextual information is supplied. When we
incorporate retrieval-augmented prompting, providing the gold-source abstract
raises accuracy on previously incorrect items to 0.79; providing top 3 PubMed
abstracts (ranked by semantic relevance) improves accuracy to 0.23, while
random abstracts reduce accuracy (0.10, within temperature variation). These
effects are mirrored in GPT-4o-mini, underscoring that source clarity and
targeted retrieval -- not just model size -- drive performance. Overall, our
results highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for
evidence-based clinical question answering. Retrieval-augmented prompting
emerges as a useful strategy to improve factual accuracy and alignment with
source evidence, while stratified evaluation by specialty and question type
remains essential to understand current knowledge access and to contextualize
model performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话AI系统在长期记忆方面存在缺陷，复杂的推理负担被放在响应生成阶段，导致性能严重依赖模型规模。需要一种方法能够在记忆构建阶段就完成复杂推理，减轻推理时的计算负担。

Method: PREMem方法在记忆预存储阶段进行推理：1）提取细粒度记忆片段（事实性、经验性、主观性信息）；2）建立跨会话记忆项之间的显式关系；3）捕捉演化模式（扩展、转换、含义等）。

Result: 实验显示在所有模型规模上都取得了显著性能提升，较小模型能够达到与更大基线模型相当的结果，即使在受限的token预算下也能保持有效性。

Conclusion: PREMem通过将复杂推理从推理阶段转移到记忆构建阶段，创造了丰富的表示同时减少了交互时的计算需求，为长期记忆对话系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective long-term memory in conversational AI requires synthesizing
information across multiple sessions. However, current systems place excessive
reasoning burden on response generation, making performance significantly
dependent on model sizes. We introduce PREMem (Pre-storage Reasoning for
Episodic Memory), a novel approach that shifts complex reasoning processes from
inference to memory construction. PREMem extracts fine-grained memory fragments
categorized into factual, experiential, and subjective information; it then
establishes explicit relationships between memory items across sessions,
capturing evolution patterns like extensions, transformations, and
implications. By performing this reasoning during pre-storage rather than when
generating a response, PREMem creates enriched representations while reducing
computational demands during interactions. Experiments show significant
performance improvements across all model sizes, with smaller models achieving
results comparable to much larger baselines while maintaining effectiveness
even with constrained token budgets. Code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: 语言模型基准测试可以通过超越静态评估来显著改进，项目反应理论提高有效性，动态项目选择降低方差

Abstract: Language model (LM) benchmarking faces several challenges: comprehensive
evaluations are costly, benchmarks often fail to measure the intended
capabilities, and evaluation quality can degrade due to labeling errors and
benchmark saturation. Although various strategies have been proposed to
mitigate these issues, they tend to address individual aspects in isolation,
neglecting broader questions about overall evaluation quality. Here, we
introduce Fluid Benchmarking, a new evaluation approach that advances LM
benchmarking across multiple dimensions. Inspired by psychometrics, Fluid
Benchmarking is based on the insight that the relative value of benchmark items
depends on an LM's capability level, suggesting that evaluation should adapt to
each LM. Methodologically, Fluid Benchmarking estimates an item response model
based on existing LM evaluation results and uses the inferred quantities to
select evaluation items dynamically, similar to computerized adaptive testing
in education. In our experiments, we compare Fluid Benchmarking against the
common practice of random item sampling as well as more sophisticated
baselines, including alternative methods grounded in item response theory. We
examine four dimensions -- efficiency, validity, variance, and saturation --
and find that Fluid Benchmarking achieves superior performance in all of them
(e.g., higher validity and less variance on MMLU with fifty times fewer items).
Our analysis shows that the two components of Fluid Benchmarking have distinct
effects: item response theory, used to map performance into a latent ability
space, increases validity, while dynamic item selection reduces variance.
Overall, our results suggest that LM benchmarking can be substantially improved
by moving beyond static evaluation.

Motivation: 研究LLM在谬误分类任务中上下文和情感元数据的影响，特别是在政治辩论场景中，探索如何通过理论框架改进LLM的逻辑推理能力。

Method: 使用美国大选辩论数据，对Qwen-3(8B)模型应用多种提示策略，包括基于语用辩证学和论证周期表的Chain-of-Thought框架，在三种输入设置下评估：纯文本、文本+上下文、文本+上下文+音频情感元数据。

Result: 理论提示可以提高可解释性，但添加上下文和情感元数据通常会降低性能。情感元数据使模型偏向将陈述标记为"诉诸情感"谬误，基础提示往往优于增强提示。

Conclusion: 额外的输入信息可能导致注意力稀释，反而恶化LLM的谬误分类性能，情感元数据对逻辑推理有负面影响。

Abstract: This study investigates how context and emotional tone metadata influence
large language model (LLM) reasoning and performance in fallacy classification
tasks, particularly within political debate settings. Using data from U.S.
presidential debates, we classify six fallacy types through various prompting
strategies applied to the Qwen-3 (8B) model. We introduce two theoretically
grounded Chain-of-Thought frameworks: Pragma-Dialectics and the Periodic Table
of Arguments, and evaluate their effectiveness against a baseline prompt under
three input settings: text-only, text with context, and text with both context
and audio-based emotional tone metadata. Results suggest that while theoretical
prompting can improve interpretability and, in some cases, accuracy, the
addition of context and especially emotional tone metadata often leads to
lowered performance. Emotional tone metadata biases the model toward labeling
statements as \textit{Appeal to Emotion}, worsening logical reasoning. Overall,
basic prompts often outperformed enhanced ones, suggesting that attention
dilution from added inputs may worsen rather than improve fallacy
classification in LLMs.

Motivation: 观察到表情符号可能触发大语言模型生成有毒内容，旨在研究表情符号是否确实能增强LLM的毒性生成能力，并解释这一现象背后的机制。

Method: 通过自动化构建包含表情符号的提示词来微妙表达毒性意图，在5种主流语言的7个著名LLM上进行实验，包括越狱任务，并进行模型层面的语义认知、序列生成和分词分析。

Result: 实验表明带有表情符号的提示词容易诱导毒性内容生成，表情符号可以作为异质语义通道绕过安全机制，预训练语料中的表情符号相关数据污染与毒性生成行为存在潜在关联。

Conclusion: 表情符号确实能显著增强LLM的毒性生成能力，这一现象源于表情符号作为异质语义通道绕过安全机制的特性，以及预训练数据中的污染问题。

Abstract: Emojis are globally used non-verbal cues in digital communication, and
extensive research has examined how large language models (LLMs) understand and
utilize emojis across contexts. While usually associated with friendliness or
playfulness, it is observed that emojis may trigger toxic content generation in
LLMs. Motivated by such a observation, we aim to investigate: (1) whether
emojis can clearly enhance the toxicity generation in LLMs and (2) how to
interpret this phenomenon. We begin with a comprehensive exploration of
emoji-triggered LLM toxicity generation by automating the construction of
prompts with emojis to subtly express toxic intent. Experiments across 5
mainstream languages on 7 famous LLMs along with jailbreak tasks demonstrate
that prompts with emojis could easily induce toxicity generation. To understand
this phenomenon, we conduct model-level interpretations spanning semantic
cognition, sequence generation and tokenization, suggesting that emojis can act
as a heterogeneous semantic channel to bypass the safety mechanisms. To pursue
deeper insights, we further probe the pre-training corpus and uncover potential
correlation between the emoji-related data polution with the toxicity
generation behaviors. Supplementary materials provide our implementation code
and data. (Warning: This paper contains potentially sensitive contents)

Conclusion: OBR提供了一种有效的训练无关压缩方案，成功解决了量化与稀疏化的冲突问题

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) compression, such as
quantization and pruning, have achieved notable success. However, as these
techniques gradually approach their respective limits, relying on a single
method for further compression has become increasingly challenging. In this
work, we explore an alternative solution by combining quantization and
sparsity. This joint approach, though promising, introduces new difficulties
due to the inherently conflicting requirements on weight distributions:
quantization favors compact ranges, while pruning benefits from high variance.
To attack this problem, we propose Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR), a general
and training-free framework that aligns pruning and quantization by error
compensation between both. OBR minimizes performance degradation on downstream
tasks by building on a second-order Hessian objective, which is then
reformulated into a tractable problem through surrogate approximation and
ultimately reaches a closed-form solution via group error compensation.
Experiments show that OBR enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50%
sparsity on existing LLMs, and delivers up to 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory
reduction compared to the FP16-dense baseline.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a major barrier to their
reliable use in critical decision-making. Although existing hallucination
detection methods have improved accuracy, they still struggle with
disentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness. To
address these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via
reasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP
establishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct
sum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes
linguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these
subspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its
parameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are
obtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the
reasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input
features for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP
reduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original,
filters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness. Experiments across
multiple datasets show that HARP achieves state-of-the-art hallucination
detection performance; in particular, it achieves an AUROC of 92.8% on
TriviaQA, outperforming the previous best method by 7.5%.

Conclusion: 通过捕捉推理过程中表示的水平和垂直动态，D²HScore提供了一个可解释且轻量级的幻觉检测代理方法。

Abstract: Although large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
practical application is often hindered by the generation of non-factual
content, which is called "hallucination". Ensuring the reliability of LLMs'
outputs is a critical challenge, particularly in high-stakes domains such as
finance, security, and healthcare. In this work, we revisit hallucination
detection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics.
Leveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of
LLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the
semantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic
depth of core concepts as they evolve across layers. Based on this insight, we
propose \textbf{D$^2$HScore (Dispersion and Drift-based Hallucination Score)},
a training-free and label-free framework that jointly measures: (1)
\textbf{Intra-Layer Dispersion}, which quantifies the semantic diversity of
token representations within each layer; and (2) \textbf{Inter-Layer Drift},
which tracks the progressive transformation of key token representations across
layers. To ensure drift reflects the evolution of meaningful semantics rather
than noisy or redundant tokens, we guide token selection using attention
signals. By capturing both the horizontal and vertical dynamics of
representation during inference, D$^2$HScore provides an interpretable and
lightweight proxy for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across
five open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
D$^2$HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines.

Abstract: Large language models in healthcare often miss critical emotional cues,
delivering medically sound but emotionally flat advice. This is especially
problematic in clinical contexts where patients are distressed and vulnerable,
and require empathic communication to support safety, adherence, and trust. We
present RECAP (Reflect-Extract-Calibrate-Align-Produce), an inference-time
framework that adds structured emotional reasoning without retraining. By
decomposing empathy into transparent appraisal-theoretic stages and exposing
per-dimension Likert signals, RECAP produces nuanced, auditable responses.
Across EmoBench, SECEU, and EQ-Bench, RECAP improves emotional reasoning by
22-28% on 8B models and 10-13% on larger models over zero-shot baselines.
Clinician evaluations further confirm superior empathetic communication. RECAP
shows that modular, theory-grounded prompting can systematically enhance
emotional intelligence in medical AI while preserving the accountability

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法对所有参数统一处理，无法区分通用语义表示和领域特定模式，导致次优剪枝决策。领域特定嵌入模型虽然性能优越但参数量大，在资源受限环境中部署困难

Method: 使用Fisher信息衡量重要性，通过通用领域梯度对齐评估参数行为，结合这两种信号形成领域对齐重要性(DAI)评分。低DAI分数表示参数对领域任务不重要或在领域与通用目标间产生冲突

Result: 在FinMTEB和ChemTEB两个领域基准测试中，GAPrune在50%稀疏度的一次性剪枝中性能损失控制在2.5%以内，优于所有基线方法。经过100步重训练后，在FinMTEB上提升4.51%，在ChemTEB上提升1.73%

Conclusion: 有原则的剪枝策略可以实现模型压缩和增强领域专业化，为研究社区提供了新的开发方法

Abstract: Domain-specific embedding models have shown promise for applications that
require specialized semantic understanding, such as coding agents and financial
retrieval systems, often achieving higher performance gains than general
models. However, state-of-the-art embedding models are typically based on LLMs,
which contain billions of parameters, making deployment challenging in
resource-constrained environments. Model compression through pruning offers a
promising solution, but existing pruning methods treat all parameters
uniformly, failing to distinguish between general semantic representations and
domain-specific patterns, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions. Thus, we
propose GAPrune, a pruning framework that addresses this challenge by
considering both domain importance and preserving general linguistic
foundation. Our method uses Fisher Information to measure importance and
general-domain gradient alignment to assess parameter behavior, then combines
these signals using our Domain Alignment Importance (DAI) scoring. Lower DAI
scores indicate that the parameter is either less important for the domain task
or creates conflicts between domain and general objectives. Experiments on two
domain benchmarks, FinMTEB and ChemTEB, show that GAPrune maintains performance
within 2.5% of dense models in one-shot pruning at 50% sparsity, while
outperforming all baselines. With retraining in 100 steps, GAPrune achieves
+4.51% improvement on FinMTEB and +1.73% on ChemTEB, demonstrating that our
pruning strategy not only preserves but enhances domain-specific capabilities.
Our findings demonstrate that principled pruning strategies can achieve model
compression and enhanced domain specialization, providing the research
community with a new approach for development.

Abstract: Sentences with multiple quantifiers often lead to interpretive ambiguities,
which can vary across languages. This study adopts a cross-linguistic approach
to examine how large language models (LLMs) handle quantifier scope
interpretation in English and Chinese, using probabilities to assess

extent to which LLMs emulate human performance across language groups. Results
reveal that most LLMs prefer the surface scope interpretations, aligning with
human tendencies, while only some differentiate between English and Chinese in
the inverse scope preferences, reflecting human-similar patterns. HS scores
highlight variability in LLMs' approximation of human behavior, but their
overall potential to align with humans is notable. Differences in model
architecture, scale, and particularly models' pre-training data language

methodology leveraging factual knowledge to synthesize culturally relevant
question-answer pairs. The CultureSynth-7 synthetic benchmark contains 19,360
entries and 4,149 manually verified entries across 7 languages. Evaluation of
14 prevalent LLMs of different sizes reveals clear performance stratification
led by ChatGPT-4o-Latest and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that
a 3B-parameter threshold is necessary for achieving basic cultural competence,

Conclusion: Text2Mem为智能体内存控制提供了标准化基础，解决了现有框架的功能局限和规范缺失问题。

Abstract: Large language model agents increasingly depend on memory to sustain long
horizon interaction, but existing frameworks remain limited. Most expose only a
few basic primitives such as encode, retrieve, and delete, while higher order
operations like merge, promote, demote, split, lock, and expire are missing or
inconsistently supported. Moreover, there is no formal and executable
specification for memory commands, leaving scope and lifecycle rules implicit
and causing unpredictable behavior across systems. We introduce Text2Mem, a
unified memory operation language that provides a standardized pathway from
natural language to reliable execution. Text2Mem defines a compact yet
expressive operation set aligned with encoding, storage, and retrieval. Each
instruction is represented as a JSON based schema instance with required fields
and semantic invariants, which a parser transforms into typed operation objects
with normalized parameters. A validator ensures correctness before execution,
while adapters map typed objects either to a SQL prototype backend or to real
memory frameworks. Model based services such as embeddings or summarization are
integrated when required. All results are returned through a unified execution
contract. This design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across
heterogeneous backends. We also outline Text2Mem Bench, a planned benchmark
that separates schema generation from backend execution to enable systematic
evaluation. Together, these components establish the first standardized
foundation for memory control in agents.

Abstract: Ensuring user privacy by synthesizing data from large language models (LLMs)
tuned under differential privacy (DP) has become popular recently. However, the
impact of DP fine-tuned LLMs on the quality of the language and the utility of
the texts they produce has not been investigated. In this work, we tune five
LLMs with three corpora under four levels of privacy and assess the length, the
grammatical correctness, and the lexical diversity of the text outputs they
produce. We also probe the utility of the synthetic outputs in downstream
classification tasks such as book genre recognition based on book descriptions
and cause of death recognition based on verbal autopsies. The results indicate
that LLMs tuned under stronger privacy constrains produce texts that are
shorter by at least 77 %, that are less grammatically correct by at least 9 %,
and are less diverse by at least 10 % in bi-gram diversity. Furthermore, the
accuracy they reach in downstream classification tasks decreases, which might
be detrimental to the usefulness of the generated synthetic data.

Abstract: Developing effective prompts demands significant cognitive investment to
generate reliable, high-quality responses from Large Language Models (LLMs). By
deploying case-specific prompt engineering techniques that streamline
frequently performed life sciences workflows, researchers could achieve
substantial efficiency gains that far exceed the initial time investment
required to master these techniques. The Prompt Report published in 2025
outlined 58 different text-based prompt engineering techniques, highlighting
the numerous ways prompts could be constructed. To provide actionable
guidelines and reduce the friction of navigating these various approaches, we
distil this report to focus on 6 core techniques: zero-shot, few-shot
approaches, thought generation, ensembling, self-criticism, and decomposition.
We breakdown the significance of each approach and ground it in use cases
relevant to life sciences, from literature summarization and data extraction to
editorial tasks. We provide detailed recommendations for how prompts should and
shouldn't be structured, addressing common pitfalls including multi-turn
conversation degradation, hallucinations, and distinctions between reasoning
and non-reasoning models. We examine context window limitations, agentic tools
like Claude Code, while analyzing the effectiveness of Deep Research tools

replace existing established individual practices around data processing and
document editing. Our aim is to provide actionable guidance on core prompt

prompting to an effective, low-friction systematic practice that contributes to

Motivation: 多语言模型通常针对固定语言集训练，添加新语言需要从头训练，成本高昂且不现实。现有方法如持续预训练会导致灾难性遗忘，而经验回放等方法因缺乏原始预训练数据而无法使用。

Method: 提出Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA)方法，基于两个关键发现：(1) LoRA可以减少遗忘，(2)多语言模型在初始层编码源语言，中间层用英语推理，最终层翻译回源语言。通过在选定的初始和最终层添加LoRA适配器，同时冻结其他层。

Result: 在添加加利西亚语、斯瓦希里语和乌尔都语的实验中，LayRA在保持原有语言能力方面提供了最佳平衡，与现有方法（如LoRA）在新语言学习方面竞争力相当。通过模型算术，适应后的模型可以在没有目标语言指令调优数据的情况下获得强大的指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: LayRA是一种有效的持续多语言扩展方法，能够在仅使用目标语言预训练数据的情况下，成功向现有多语言模型添加新语言，同时保持原有性能。

Abstract: Multilingual language models are trained on a fixed set of languages, and to
support new languages, the models need to be retrained from scratch. This is an
expensive endeavor and is often infeasible, as model developers tend not to
release their pre-training data. Naive approaches, such as continued
pretraining, suffer from catastrophic forgetting; however, mitigation
strategies like experience replay cannot be applied due to the lack of original
pretraining data. In this work, we investigate the problem of continually
adding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining
data in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address
this problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank
Adapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of
the model frozen. LayRA builds on two insights: (1) LoRA reduces forgetting,
and (2) multilingual models encode inputs in the source language in the initial
layers, reason in English in intermediate layers, and translate back to the
source language in final layers. We experiment with adding multiple
combinations of Galician, Swahili, and Urdu to pretrained language models and
evaluate each method on diverse multilingual tasks. We find that LayRA provides
the overall best tradeoff between preserving models' capabilities in previously
supported languages, while being competitive with existing approaches such as
LoRA in learning new languages. We also demonstrate that using model
arithmetic, the adapted models can be equipped with strong instruction
following abilities without access to any instruction tuning data in the target
languages.

Motivation: 解决数值和时间声明的自动验证问题，探索大语言模型在事实核查任务中的应用潜力，特别是在证据检索和模型适应方面的挑战。

Method: 采用两种互补方法：1）使用指令调优LLM进行零样本提示；2）使用参数高效的LoRA进行监督微调。同时研究多种证据选择策略，包括完整文档输入和基于BM25、MiniLM的top-k句子过滤。

Result: 基于LLaMA和LoRA微调的最佳模型在英文验证集上表现出色，但在测试集上性能显著下降，显示出泛化挑战。证据粒度对性能有重要影响。

Conclusion: 证据粒度和模型适应对于稳健的数值事实验证至关重要，需要进一步研究如何提高模型在未见数据上的泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Task 3 of the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab,
which focuses on verifying numerical and temporal claims using retrieved
evidence. We explore two complementary approaches: zero-shot prompting with
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) and supervised fine-tuning using
parameter-efficient LoRA. To enhance evidence quality, we investigate several
selection strategies, including full-document input and top-k sentence
filtering using BM25 and MiniLM. Our best-performing model LLaMA fine-tuned
with LoRA achieves strong performance on the English validation set. However, a
notable drop in the test set highlights a generalization challenge. These
findings underscore the importance of evidence granularity and model adaptation
for robust numerical fact verification.

Motivation: 现有RAG评估基准在评估文档分块质量方面存在不足，特别是由于证据稀疏性问题，缺乏有效的评估工具来准确衡量不同分块方法对RAG系统整体性能的影响。

Method: 1) 分析现有RAG评估基准的局限性；2) 提出HiCBench基准，包含人工标注的多级文档分块点、合成的证据密集QA对及其对应证据源；3) 开发HiChunk框架，基于微调LLM的多级文档结构化框架，结合Auto-Merge检索算法。

Conclusion: HiCBench解决了RAG系统文档分块评估的挑战，HiChunk框架通过多级分块和优化检索显著提高了RAG系统的效果和可靠性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response capabilities of
language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, document
chunking as an important part of RAG system often lacks effective evaluation
tools. This paper first analyzes why existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are
inadequate for assessing document chunking quality, specifically due to
evidence sparsity. Based on this conclusion, we propose HiCBench, which
includes manually annotated multi-level document chunking points, synthesized
evidence-dense quetion answer(QA) pairs, and their corresponding evidence
sources. Additionally, we introduce the HiChunk framework, a multi-level
document structuring framework based on fine-tuned LLMs, combined with the
Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm to improve retrieval quality. Experiments
demonstrate that HiCBench effectively evaluates the impact of different
chunking methods across the entire RAG pipeline. Moreover, HiChunk achieves
better chunking quality within reasonable time consumption, thereby enhancing
the overall performance of RAG systems.

Abstract: Disinformation spreads rapidly across linguistic boundaries, yet most AI
models are still benchmarked only on English. We address this gap with a
systematic comparison of five multilingual transformer models: mBERT, XLM,
XLM-RoBERTa, RemBERT, and mT5 on a common fake-vs-true machine learning
classification task. While transformer-based language models have demonstrated
notable success in detecting disinformation in English, their effectiveness in
multilingual contexts still remains up for debate. To facilitate evaluation, we
introduce PolyTruth Disinfo Corpus, a novel corpus of 60,486 statement pairs
(false claim vs. factual correction) spanning over twenty five languages that
collectively cover five language families and a broad topical range from
politics, health, climate, finance, and conspiracy, half of which are
fact-checked disinformation claims verified by an augmented MindBugs Discovery
dataset. Our experiments revealed performance variations. Models such as
RemBERT achieved better overall accuracy, particularly excelling in
low-resource languages, whereas models like mBERT and XLM exhibit considerable
limitations when training data is scarce. We provide a discussion of these
performance patterns and implications for real-world deployment. The dataset is
publicly available on our GitHub repository to encourage further
experimentation and advancement. Our findings illuminate both the potential and
the current limitations of AI systems for multilingual disinformation

Abstract: The proliferation of clickbait headlines poses significant challenges to the
credibility of information and user trust in digital media. While recent
advances in machine learning have improved the detection of manipulative
content, the lack of explainability limits their practical adoption. This paper
presents a model for explainable clickbait detection that not only identifies
clickbait titles but also attributes them to specific linguistic manipulation
strategies. We introduce a synthetic dataset generated by systematically
augmenting real news headlines using a predefined catalogue of clickbait
strategies. This dataset enables controlled experimentation and detailed
analysis of model behaviour. We present a two-stage framework for automatic
clickbait analysis comprising detection and tactic attribution. In the first
stage, we compare a fine-tuned BERT classifier with large language models
(LLMs), specifically GPT-4.0 and Gemini 2.4 Flash, under both zero-shot
prompting and few-shot prompting enriched with illustrative clickbait headlines
and their associated persuasive tactics. In the second stage, a dedicated
BERT-based classifier predicts the specific clickbait strategies present in
each headline. This work advances the development of transparent and

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的评估基准主要关注客观视觉问答或字幕生成，无法充分评估模型理解复杂主观人类情感的能力，需要专门的情感理解基准。

Method: 从Reddit平台收集350个样本，每个样本包含图像、用户提供的文本和情感类别(悲伤、幽默、讽刺、快乐)。设计分层任务框架，包含6个多选题和1个开放式问题，从基础感知(颜色、物体识别)到高级认知(场景推理、意图理解、深度共情)。使用Claude 4 AI辅助和人工验证确保标注质量。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they
have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a variety of vision-language
tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective
visual question answering or captioning, inadequately assessing the models'
ability to understand complex and subjective human emotions. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EmoBench-Reddit, a novel, hierarchical benchmark for
multimodal emotion understanding. The dataset comprises 350 meticulously
curated samples from the social media platform Reddit, each containing an
image, associated user-provided text, and an emotion category (sad, humor,
sarcasm, happy) confirmed by user flairs. We designed a hierarchical task
framework that progresses from basic perception to advanced cognition, with
each data point featuring six multiple-choice questions and one open-ended
question of increasing difficulty. Perception tasks evaluate the model's
ability to identify basic visual elements (e.g., colors, objects), while
cognition tasks require scene reasoning, intent understanding, and deep empathy
integrating textual context. We ensured annotation quality through a
combination of AI assistance (Claude 4) and manual verification.

Buying Style Profile to simulate a variety of negotiation scenarios involving
diverse personalities. Thorough automatic and manual evaluations indicate that
the dataset comprises high-quality dialogues. Further, we conduct comparative

Multi-dimensional evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned LLMs effectively
generate personality-driven rational responses during negotiations. This

inference. A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with
the document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities.
Unlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document
without repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit
word-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six
multimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and
multimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61. Further
analysis shows its effectiveness in downstream few-shot retrieval and its
ability to capture visually grounded semantics in complex domains such as
scientific articles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的指代消解方法（如QA模板和文档模板）存在幻觉问题和性能不足，需要开发更有效的技术来解决这些限制。

Method: 提出了两种新技术：1）反向训练联合推理 - 改进QA模板方法；2）迭代文档生成 - 消除生成源文本中的幻觉并提升指代消解性能

Result: 实验表明反向训练提升了QA模板方法的性能，迭代文档生成有效消除了幻觉问题并提升了指代消解效果，两种方法的整合提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Conclusion: 通过整合反向训练和迭代文档生成技术，为基于LLM的指代消解提供了有效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Coreference Resolution (CR) is crucial for many NLP tasks, but existing LLMs
struggle with hallucination and under-performance. In this paper, we
investigate the limitations of existing LLM-based approaches to CR-specifically
the Question-Answering (QA) Template and Document Template methods and propose
two novel techniques: Reversed Training with Joint Inference and Iterative
Document Generation. Our experiments show that Reversed Training improves the
QA Template method, while Iterative Document Generation eliminates
hallucinations in the generated source text and boosts coreference resolution.
Integrating these methods and techniques offers an effective and robust
solution to LLM-based coreference resolution.

integrating and understanding language, vision, and conversational interaction.
We study the capabilities of seven state-of-the-art Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs) as overhearers to a corpus of spontaneous conversations between
pairs of human discourse participants engaged in a collaborative
object-matching task. We find that such a task remains challenging for current
LVLMs and they all fail to show a consistent performance improvement as they
overhear more conversations from the same discourse participants repeating the
same task for multiple rounds. We release our corpus and code for

Result: medgemma-27b-text-it在多个考试中正确率超过90%，小于10B参数的模型正确率低于60%。微调后的medgemma-4b-it性能超越所有小于10B参数的模型，并与70B参数模型相当。

Conclusion: 对于需要西班牙语国家和类似秘鲁流行病学特征知识库的医学AI应用，推荐使用medgemma-27b-text-it或微调版的medgemma-4b-it。

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Medical large language models (LLMS) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in answering medical examinations. However, the extent to which
this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from
a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as
LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a
dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians
pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate
and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the
fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice
question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12
medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including
medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific
prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient
fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it
utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS:
medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of
correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion
parameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results
<50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all
LLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters
across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and
research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those
exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties
should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.

Result: 小模型表现出更强的刻板印象偏见，大模型与人类偏好更一致；加入身份信息通常会加剧偏见，特别是在情感判断方面。

Conclusion: 需要在主观视觉语言任务中建立身份感知的评估框架，以识别和缓解模型偏见。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
Personalized Image Aesthetic Assessment (PIAA) as a scalable alternative to
expert evaluations. However, their predictions may reflect subtle biases
influenced by demographic factors such as gender, age, and education. In this
work, we propose AesBiasBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs along two
complementary dimensions: (1) stereotype bias, quantified by measuring
variations in aesthetic evaluations across demographic groups; and (2)
alignment between model outputs and genuine human aesthetic preferences. Our
benchmark covers three subtasks (Aesthetic Perception, Assessment, Empathy) and
introduces structured metrics (IFD, NRD, AAS) to assess both bias and
alignment. We evaluate 19 MLLMs, including proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o,
Claude-3.5-Sonnet) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL-2.5, Qwen2.5-VL).
Results indicate that smaller models exhibit stronger stereotype biases,
whereas larger models align more closely with human preferences. Incorporating
identity information often exacerbates bias, particularly in emotional
judgments. These findings underscore the importance of identity-aware
evaluation frameworks in subjective vision-language tasks.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in mental health and other
sensitive domains raises urgent questions about ethical reasoning, fairness,

decision-making do not adequately capture the unique ethical dilemmas
encountered in mental health practice, where confidentiality, autonomy,
beneficence, and bias frequently intersect. To address this gap, we introduce

designed to evaluate how AI systems navigate ethically charged situations in
therapeutic and psychiatric contexts. Each scenario is enriched with structured
fields, including multiple decision options, expert-aligned reasoning, expected
model behavior, real-world impact, and multi-stakeholder viewpoints. This
structure enables evaluation not only of decision accuracy but also of
explanation quality and alignment with professional norms. Although modest in
scale and developed with model-assisted generation, EthicsMH establishes a task
framework that bridges AI ethics and mental health decision-making. By
releasing this dataset, we aim to provide a seed resource that can be expanded
through community and expert contributions, fostering the development of AI
systems capable of responsibly handling some of society's most delicate

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上取得了最佳性能表现

Conclusion: DYNAMO通过知识图谱动态更新和LLM集成，有效解决了新知识真实性和新闻语义深度挖掘两个关键问题

Abstract: As the Internet and social media evolve rapidly, distinguishing credible news
from a vast amount of complex information poses a significant challenge. Due to
the suddenness and instability of news events, the authenticity labels of news
can potentially shift as events develop, making it crucial for fake news
detection to obtain the latest event updates. Existing methods employ
retrieval-augmented generation to fill knowledge gaps, but they suffer from
issues such as insufficient credibility of retrieved content and interference
from noisy information. We propose a dynamic knowledge update-driven model for
fake news detection (DYNAMO), which leverages knowledge graphs to achieve
continuous updating of new knowledge and integrates with large language models
to fulfill dual functions: news authenticity detection and verification of new
knowledge correctness, solving the two key problems of ensuring the
authenticity of new knowledge and deeply mining news semantics. Specifically,
we first construct a news-domain-specific knowledge graph. Then, we use Monte
Carlo Tree Search to decompose complex news and verify them step by step.
Finally, we extract and update new knowledge from verified real news texts and
reasoning paths. Experimental results demonstrate that DYNAMO achieves the best
performance on two real-world datasets.

Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with

overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the
trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few
studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across
generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach
grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first
assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates
them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the
generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic
variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both
response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation is a promising
technique for utilizing private datasets that otherwise cannot be exposed for
model training or other analytics. While much research literature has focused
on generating private unstructured text and image data, in enterprise settings,
structured data (e.g., tabular) is more common, often including natural
language fields or components. Existing synthetic data evaluation techniques
(e.g., FID) struggle to capture the structural properties and correlations of
such datasets. In this work, we propose Struct-Bench, a framework and benchmark
for evaluating synthetic datasets derived from structured datasets that contain
natural language data. The Struct-Bench framework requires users to provide a
representation of their dataset structure as a Context-Free Grammar (CFG). Our
benchmark comprises 5 real-world and 2 synthetically generated datasets, each
annotated with CFGs. We show that these datasets demonstrably present a great
challenge even for state-of-the-art DP synthetic data generation methods.
Struct-Bench also includes reference implementations of different metrics and a
leaderboard, thereby providing researchers a standardized evaluation platform
to benchmark and investigate privacy-preserving synthetic data generation
methods. Further, we also present a case study showing how to use Struct-Bench
to improve the synthetic data quality of Private Evolution (PE) on structured
data. The benchmark and the leaderboard have been publicly made available at

Conclusion: Text2SignDiff方法能够实现更准确和上下文相关的手语生成，无需gloss注释，促进了聋哑人群的数字包容

Abstract: Sign language production (SLP) aims to translate spoken language sentences
into a sequence of pose frames in a sign language, bridging the communication
gap and promoting digital inclusion for deaf and hard-of-hearing communities.
Existing methods typically rely on gloss, a symbolic representation of sign
language words or phrases that serves as an intermediate step in SLP. This
limits the flexibility and generalization of SLP, as gloss annotations are
often unavailable and language-specific. Therefore, we present a novel
diffusion-based generative approach - Text2Sign Diffusion (Text2SignDiff) for
gloss-free SLP. Specifically, a gloss-free latent diffusion model is proposed
to generate sign language sequences from noisy latent sign codes and spoken
text jointly, reducing the potential error accumulation through a
non-autoregressive iterative denoising process. We also design a cross-modal
signing aligner that learns a shared latent space to bridge visual and textual
content in sign and spoken languages. This alignment supports the conditioned
diffusion-based process, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant sign
language generation without gloss. Extensive experiments on the commonly used
PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Term2Note是使用敏感临床笔记的可行隐私保护替代方案，在较少假设下实现了更好的隐私-效用平衡

Abstract: Training data is fundamental to the success of modern machine learning
models, yet in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, the use of real-world
training data is severely constrained by concerns over privacy leakage. A
promising solution to this challenge is the use of differentially private (DP)
synthetic data, which offers formal privacy guarantees while maintaining data
utility. However, striking the right balance between privacy protection and
utility remains challenging in clinical note synthesis, given its domain
specificity and the complexity of long-form text generation. In this paper, we
present Term2Note, a methodology to synthesise long clinical notes under strong
DP constraints. By structurally separating content and form, Term2Note
generates section-wise note content conditioned on DP medical terms, with each
governed by separate DP constraints. A DP quality maximiser further enhances
synthetic notes by selecting high-quality outputs. Experimental results show
that Term2Note produces synthetic notes with statistical properties closely
aligned with real clinical notes, demonstrating strong fidelity. In addition,
multi-label classification models trained on these synthetic notes perform
comparably to those trained on real data, confirming their high utility.
Compared to existing DP text generation baselines, Term2Note achieves
substantial improvements in both fidelity and utility while operating under
fewer assumptions, suggesting its potential as a viable privacy-preserving
alternative to using sensitive clinical notes.

Motivation: 环境、社会和治理(ESG)数据在监管和投资中的重要性日益增长，但将非结构化新闻源中的争议相关数据与基于原则的规范性框架(如联合国全球契约)对齐存在重大挑战，因为这些框架通常使用抽象语言且缺乏标准化分类法。

Method: 使用轻量级本体设计、形式化模式建模和大型语言模型，将规范性原则转换为可重用的RDF模板，从新闻内容中提取相关信息并构建结构化知识图谱，将报告的事件与特定框架原则相连接。

Result: 开发了一个可扩展且透明的框架，用于识别和解释国际可持续性准则的违规情况，实现了ESG事件的结构化知识表示。

Conclusion: 该方法为ESG数据的准确、可解释和国际对齐表示提供了一种有效的半自动化解决方案，解决了规范性框架与商业数据提供商分类系统之间的对齐挑战。

Abstract: The growing importance of environmental, social, and governance data in
regulatory and investment contexts has increased the need for accurate,
interpretable, and internationally aligned representations of non-financial
risks, particularly those reported in unstructured news sources. However,
aligning such controversy-related data with principle-based normative
frameworks, such as the United Nations Global Compact or Sustainable
Development Goals, presents significant challenges. These frameworks are
typically expressed in abstract language, lack standardized taxonomies, and
differ from the proprietary classification systems used by commercial data
providers. In this paper, we present a semi-automatic method for constructing
structured knowledge representations of environmental, social, and governance
events reported in the news. Our approach uses lightweight ontology design,
formal pattern modeling, and large language models to convert normative
principles into reusable templates expressed in the Resource Description
Framework. These templates are used to extract relevant information from news
content and populate a structured knowledge graph that links reported incidents
to specific framework principles. The result is a scalable and transparent
framework for identifying and interpreting non-compliance with international
sustainability guidelines.

Abstract: With many endangered languages at risk of disappearing, efforts to preserve
them now rely more than ever on using technology alongside culturally informed
teaching strategies. This study examines user behaviors in TALKA, a generative
AI-powered chatbot designed for Hakka language engagement, by employing a
dual-layered analytical framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy of cognitive
processes and dialogue act categorization. We analyzed 7,077 user utterances,
each carefully annotated according to six cognitive levels and eleven dialogue
act types. These included a variety of functions, such as asking for
information, requesting translations, making cultural inquiries, and using
language creatively. Pragmatic classifications further highlight how different
types of dialogue acts--such as feedback, control commands, and social
greetings--align with specific cognitive intentions. The results suggest that
generative AI chatbots can support language learning in meaningful
ways--especially when they are designed with an understanding of how users
think and communicate. They may also help learners express themselves more
confidently and connect with their cultural identity. The TALKA case provides
empirical insights into how AI-mediated dialogue facilitates cognitive
development in low-resource language learners, as well as pragmatic negotiation
and socio-cultural affiliation. By focusing on AI-assisted language learning,
this study offers new insights into how technology can support language
preservation and educational practice.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了实体级情感分析的复杂问题，在社交媒体监控和客户反馈分析等应用中具有潜力

Abstract: Entity-level sentiment classification involves identifying the sentiment
polarity linked to specific entities within text. This task poses several
challenges: effectively modeling the subtle and complex interactions between
entities and their surrounding sentiment expressions; capturing dependencies
that may span across sentences; and ensuring consistent sentiment predictions
for multiple mentions of the same entity through coreference resolution.
Additionally, linguistic phenomena such as negation, ambiguity, and overlapping
opinions further complicate the analysis. These complexities make entity-level
sentiment classification a difficult problem, especially in real-world, noisy
textual data. To address these issues, we propose SpanEIT, a novel framework
integrating dynamic span interaction and graph-aware memory mechanisms for
enhanced entity-sentiment relational modeling. SpanEIT builds span-based
representations for entities and candidate sentiment phrases, employs
bidirectional attention for fine-grained interactions, and uses a graph
attention network to capture syntactic and co-occurrence relations. A
coreference-aware memory module ensures entity-level consistency across
documents. Experiments on FSAD, BARU, and IMDB datasets show SpanEIT
outperforms state-of-the-art transformer and hybrid baselines in accuracy and
F1 scores. Ablation and interpretability analyses validate the effectiveness of
our approach, underscoring its potential for fine-grained sentiment analysis in
applications like social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis.

Abstract: Motion instruction is a crucial task that helps athletes refine their
technique by analyzing movements and providing corrective guidance. Although
recent advances in multimodal models have improved motion understanding,
generating precise and sport-specific instruction remains challenging due to
the highly domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative
guidance. We propose CoachMe, a reference-based model that analyzes the
differences between a learner's motion and a reference under temporal and
physical aspects. This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the
acquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors
effectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, we
illustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and
boxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data.
Experiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of
directions merely in the tone of a coach but without critical information.
CoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on
boxing. Analysis further confirms that it elaborates on errors and their
corresponding improvement methods in the generated instructions. You can find

Abstract: Computational morphology has the potential to support language documentation
through tasks like morphological segmentation and the generation of Interlinear
Glossed Text (IGT). However, our research outputs have seen limited use in
real-world language documentation settings. This position paper situates the
disconnect between computational morphology and language documentation within a
broader misalignment between research and practice in NLP and argues that the
field risks becoming decontextualized and ineffectual without systematic
integration of User-Centered Design (UCD). To demonstrate how principles from
UCD can reshape the research agenda, we present a case study of GlossLM, a
state-of-the-art multilingual IGT generation model. Through a small-scale user
study with three documentary linguists, we find that despite strong metric
based performance, the system fails to meet core usability needs in real
documentation contexts. These insights raise new research questions around
model constraints, label standardization, segmentation, and personalization. We
argue that centering users not only produces more effective tools, but surfaces

Motivation: 随着AI伴侣能够进行类人交流（包括讲笑话），了解人们对AI幽默的认知和情感反应变得日益重要，特别是比较AI与人类幽默处理的神经机制差异

Method: 使用脑电图（EEG）技术，比较参与者处理AI来源和人类来源幽默时的神经反应，分析N400效应（认知努力）和LPP（情感反应）等脑电成分

Result: 行为上AI和人类幽默评分相当；神经生理上AI幽默引发较小的N400（认知努力减少）和较大的LPP（情感反应增强）；AI幽默呈现随时间递减的N400和递增的LPP，与人类幽默相反；AI信任度与情感参与度正相关

Conclusion: 大脑对AI幽默产生积极强烈反应，认知适应AI语言模式可带来增强的情感奖励，挑战了"算法厌恶"观点，表明幽默在促进人机社交互动中的潜力

Abstract: As AI companions become capable of human-like communication, including
telling jokes, understanding how people cognitively and emotionally respond to
AI humor becomes increasingly important. This study used electroencephalography
(EEG) to compare how people process humor from AI versus human sources.
Behavioral analysis revealed that participants rated AI and human humor as
comparably funny. However, neurophysiological data showed that AI humor
elicited a smaller N400 effect, suggesting reduced cognitive effort during the
processing of incongruity. This was accompanied by a larger Late Positive
Potential (LPP), indicating a greater degree of surprise and emotional
response. This enhanced LPP likely stems from the violation of low initial
expectations regarding AI's comedic capabilities. Furthermore, a key temporal
dynamic emerged: human humor showed habituation effects, marked by an
increasing N400 and a decreasing LPP over time. In contrast, AI humor
demonstrated increasing processing efficiency and emotional reward, with a
decreasing N400 and an increasing LPP. This trajectory reveals how the brain
can dynamically update its predictive model of AI capabilities. This process of
cumulative reinforcement challenges "algorithm aversion" in humor, as it
demonstrates how cognitive adaptation to AI's language patterns can lead to an
intensified emotional reward. Additionally, participants' social attitudes
toward AI modulated these neural responses, with higher perceived AI
trustworthiness correlating with enhanced emotional engagement. These findings
indicate that the brain responds to AI humor with surprisingly positive and
intense reactions, highlighting humor's potential for fostering genuine
engagement in human-AI social interaction.

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）基于注意力权重的方法，测量上下文词对目标词的影响；2）基于积分梯度的方法，利用可解释性更强的积分梯度技术。两种方法都结合原始句和替换句的语义相似性来对候选词进行排序。

Result: 在LS07和SWORDS数据集上的实验表明，两种方法都提高了排序性能。

Conclusion: 通过建模上下文对目标词的双向影响，可以更准确地表征语义变化，从而改进词汇替换任务中的候选词排序。

Abstract: A key subtask in lexical substitution is ranking the given candidate words. A
common approach is to replace the target word with a candidate in the original
sentence and feed the modified sentence into a model to capture semantic
differences before and after substitution. However, effectively modeling the
bidirectional influence of candidate substitution on both the target word and
its context remains challenging. Existing methods often focus solely on
semantic changes at the target position or rely on parameter tuning over
multiple evaluation metrics, making it difficult to accurately characterize
semantic variation. To address this, we investigate two approaches: one based
on attention weights and another leveraging the more interpretable integrated
gradients method, both designed to measure the influence of context tokens on
the target token and to rank candidates by incorporating semantic similarity
between the original and substituted sentences. Experiments on the LS07 and
SWORDS datasets demonstrate that both approaches improve ranking performance.

Abstract: Antonymy has long received particular attention in lexical semantics.
Previous studies have shown that antonym pairs frequently co-occur in text,
across genres and parts of speech, more often than would be expected by chance.
However, whether this co-occurrence pattern is distinctive of antonymy remains
unclear, due to a lack of comparison with other semantic relations. This work
fills the gap by comparing antonymy with three other relations across parts of
speech using robust co-occurrence metrics. We find that antonymy is distinctive
in three respects: antonym pairs co-occur with high strength, in a preferred
linear order, and within short spans. All results are available online.

whether room acoustic interventions in a seminar room at Graz University of
Technology support better communication in hybrid meetings. For this purpose,
we recorded two groups of persons twice, once before and once after improving

Conclusion: APASI是一种有效且通用的幻觉缓解方法，无需外部依赖即可实现稳定持续的LVLM改进，展示了其有效性和泛化能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from serious hallucination
problems, where the model-generated responses are inconsistent with the visual
inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on
preference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models
for preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable
improvement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference
Alignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that
mitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the
target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a
pair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection
process, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key
observations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination
patterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination
mitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training
strategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the
preference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous
enhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that
APASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models
but also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based
methods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and
generalization capability. The code is available at

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers unique advantages for surgery by
aligning language with surgical videos, enabling workflow understanding and
transfer across tasks without relying on expert-labeled datasets. However,
progress in surgical VLP remains constrained by the limited scale, procedural
diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets.
In this work, we present SurgLaVi, the largest and most diverse surgical
vision-language dataset to date, comprising nearly 240k clip-caption pairs from
more than 200 procedures, and comprising hierarchical levels at phase-, step-,
and task-level. At the core of SurgLaVi lies a fully automated pipeline that
systematically generates fine-grained transcriptions of surgical videos and
segments them into coherent procedural units. To ensure high-quality
annotations, it applies dual-modality filtering to remove irrelevant and noisy
samples. Within this framework, the resulting captions are enriched with
contextual detail, producing annotations that are both semantically rich and
easy to interpret. To ensure accessibility, we release SurgLaVi-\b{eta}, an
open-source derivative of 113k clip-caption pairs constructed entirely from
public data, which is over four times larger than existing surgical VLP
datasets. To demonstrate the value of SurgLaVi datasets, we introduce SurgCLIP,
a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders, as a
representative base model. SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across
phase, step, action, and tool recognition, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods, often by large margins. These results validate that large-scale,
semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate
into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as
a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在基于图像的医疗应用中的有效性，特别是在医学影像任务中与传统CNNs的性能对比，以评估LLMs在医疗领域的适用性。

Method: 使用BraTS 2020多模态脑MRI数据集，评估通用视觉-语言LLM（LLaMA 3.2 Instruct）在微调前后的性能，并与定制3D CNNs进行基准测试。对于分割任务，实现了中心点、边界框和多边形提取三种方法。

Result: CNN在胶质瘤分类中达到80%准确率，而通用LLM仅76%准确率且特异性仅18%。微调后特异性提升至55%，但整体性能下降。在分割任务中，LLMs始终将预测集中在图像中心附近，无法区分肿瘤大小和位置。

the BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, we evaluated a
general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) both before and after
fine-tuning, and benchmarked its performance against custom 3D CNNs. For glioma
classification (Low-Grade vs. High-Grade), the CNN achieved 80% accuracy and
balanced precision and recall. The general LLM reached 76% accuracy but
suffered from a specificity of only 18%, often misclassifying Low-Grade tumors.
Fine-tuning improved specificity to 55%, but overall performance declined
(e.g., accuracy dropped to 72%). For segmentation, three methods - center
point, bounding box, and polygon extraction, were implemented. CNNs accurately
localized gliomas, though small tumors were sometimes missed. In contrast, LLMs
consistently clustered predictions near the image center, with no distinction
of glioma size, location, or placement. Fine-tuning improved output formatting
but failed to meaningfully enhance spatial accuracy. The bounding polygon
method yielded random, unstructured outputs. Overall, CNNs outperformed LLMs in
both tasks. LLMs showed limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement
from fine-tuning, indicating that, in their current form, they are not
well-suited for image-based tasks. More rigorous fine-tuning or alternative
training strategies may be needed for LLMs to achieve better performance,
robustness, and utility in the medical space.

Conclusion: 该人机协作范式展示了开发适应性强、免提、以外科医生为中心的手术室工具的潜力

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and tracking of relevant elements of the surgical scene
is crucial to enable context-aware intraoperative assistance and decision
making. Current solutions remain tethered to domain-specific, supervised models
that rely on labeled data and required domain-specific data to adapt to new
surgical scenarios and beyond predefined label categories. Recent advances in
prompt-driven vision foundation models (VFM) have enabled open-set, zero-shot
segmentation across heterogeneous medical images. However, dependence of these
models on manual visual or textual cues restricts their deployment in
introperative surgical settings. We introduce a speech-guided collaborative
perception (SCOPE) framework that integrates reasoning capabilities of large
language model (LLM) with perception capabilities of open-set VFMs to support
on-the-fly segmentation, labeling and tracking of surgical instruments and
anatomy in intraoperative video streams. A key component of this framework is a
collaborative perception agent, which generates top candidates of VFM-generated
segmentation and incorporates intuitive speech feedback from clinicians to
guide the segmentation of surgical instruments in a natural human-machine
collaboration paradigm. Afterwards, instruments themselves serve as interactive
pointers to label additional elements of the surgical scene. We evaluated our
proposed framework on a subset of publicly available Cataract1k dataset and an
in-house ex-vivo skull-base dataset to demonstrate its potential to generate
on-the-fly segmentation and tracking of surgical scene. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its dynamic capabilities through a live mock ex-vivo experiment.
This human-AI collaboration paradigm showcase the potential of developing
adaptable, hands-free, surgeon-centric tools for dynamic operating-room
environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in Earth Observation have focused on large-scale foundation
models. However, these models are computationally expensive, limiting their
accessibility and reuse for downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate
compact architectures as a practical pathway toward smaller general-purpose EO
models. We propose a Metadata-aware Mixture-of-Experts Masked Autoencoder
(MoE-MAE) with only 2.5M parameters. The model combines sparse expert routing
with geo-temporal conditioning, incorporating imagery alongside
latitude/longitude and seasonal/daily cyclic encodings. We pretrain the MoE-MAE
on the BigEarthNet-Landsat dataset and evaluate embeddings from its frozen
encoder using linear probes. Despite its small size, the model competes with
much larger architectures, demonstrating that metadata-aware pretraining
improves transfer and label efficiency. To further assess generalization, we
evaluate on the EuroSAT-Landsat dataset, which lacks explicit metadata, and
still observe competitive performance compared to models with hundreds of
millions of parameters. These results suggest that compact, metadata-aware
MoE-MAEs are an efficient and scalable step toward future EO foundation models.

Motivation: 解决皮肤色调识别和生成在模型公平性、医疗健康和生成式AI中的重要挑战，由于缺乏全面数据集和鲁棒方法，现有模型在此任务上表现不佳。

Method: 创建TrueSkin数据集，包含7299张在不同光照条件、相机角度和拍摄设置下收集的图像，系统分为6个类别。使用该数据集对现有识别和生成方法进行基准测试，并训练专门的识别模型。

Result: 发现现有模型存在显著偏差：LMMs倾向于将中间肤色误分类为较浅肤色，生成模型在受提示中无关属性（如发型或环境背景）影响时难以准确生成指定肤色。在TrueSkin上训练的识别模型比LMMs和传统方法准确率提高20%以上，微调后显著改善图像生成模型的肤色保真度。

Conclusion: TrueSkin数据集不仅可作为评估现有模型的基准，还能作为有价值的训练资源，提高皮肤色调识别和生成任务的公平性和准确性。

Abstract: Skin tone recognition and generation play important roles in model fairness,
healthcare, and generative AI, yet they remain challenging due to the lack of
comprehensive datasets and robust methodologies. Compared to other human image
analysis tasks, state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) and image
generation models struggle to recognize and synthesize skin tones accurately.
To address this, we introduce TrueSkin, a dataset with 7299 images
systematically categorized into 6 classes, collected under diverse lighting
conditions, camera angles, and capture settings. Using TrueSkin, we benchmark
existing recognition and generation approaches, revealing substantial biases:
LMMs tend to misclassify intermediate skin tones as lighter ones, whereas
generative models struggle to accurately produce specified skin tones when
influenced by inherent biases from unrelated attributes in the prompts, such as
hairstyle or environmental context. We further demonstrate that training a
recognition model on TrueSkin improves classification accuracy by more than
20\% compared to LMMs and conventional approaches, and fine-tuning with
TrueSkin significantly improves skin tone fidelity in image generation models.
Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive datasets like TrueSkin, which
not only serves as a benchmark for evaluating existing models but also provides
a valuable training resource to enhance fairness and accuracy in skin tone
recognition and generation tasks.

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing

Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing

Method: 研究首先创新性地使用transformer处理像素级和图像级医学视觉任务，然后转向MLP，开创性地开发基于MLP的视觉模型来捕捉医学图像中的细粒度长距离视觉依赖。

Conclusion: MLP相比transformer和CNN提供了更优越的范式，在各种医学视觉任务中持续提升性能，为下一代医学视觉骨干网络铺平了道路。

Abstract: Medical Image Computing (MIC) is a broad research topic covering both
pixel-wise (e.g., segmentation, registration) and image-wise (e.g.,
classification, regression) vision tasks. Effective analysis demands models
that capture both global long-range context and local subtle visual
characteristics, necessitating fine-grained long-range visual dependency
modeling. Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are limited by
intrinsic locality, transformers excel at long-range modeling; however, due to
the high computational loads of self-attention, transformers typically cannot
process high-resolution features (e.g., full-scale image features before
downsampling or patch embedding) and thus face difficulties in modeling
fine-grained dependency among subtle medical image details. Concurrently,
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based visual models are recognized as
computation/memory-efficient alternatives in modeling long-range visual
dependency but have yet to be widely investigated in the MIC community. This
doctoral research advances deep learning-based MIC by investigating effective
long-range visual dependency modeling. It first presents innovative use of
transformers for both pixel- and image-wise medical vision tasks. The focus
then shifts to MLPs, pioneeringly developing MLP-based visual models to capture
fine-grained long-range visual dependency in medical images. Extensive
experiments confirm the critical role of long-range dependency modeling in MIC
and reveal a key finding: MLPs provide feasibility in modeling finer-grained
long-range dependency among higher-resolution medical features containing
enriched anatomical/pathological details. This finding establishes MLPs as a
superior paradigm over transformers/CNNs, consistently enhancing performance
across various medical vision tasks and paving the way for next-generation
medical vision backbones.

Conclusion: 该框架无需重新训练即可与现代检测器集成，实现了召回优先、精度权衡的行为，特别适用于远场计数和监控等召回敏感应用。

Abstract: Dense small objects in UAV imagery are often missed due to long-range
viewpoints, occlusion, and clutter[cite: 5]. This paper presents a
detector-agnostic post-processing framework that converts overlap-induced
redundancy into group evidence[cite: 6]. Overlapping tiling first recovers
low-confidence candidates[cite: 7]. A Spatial Gate (DBSCAN on box centroids)
and a Semantic Gate (DBSCAN on ResNet-18 embeddings) then validates group
evidence[cite: 7]. Validated groups receive controlled confidence reweighting
before class-aware NMS fusion[cite: 8]. Experiments on VisDrone show a recall
increase from 0.685 to 0.778 (+0.093) and a precision adjustment from 0.801 to
0.595, yielding F1=0.669[cite: 9]. Post-processing latency averages 0.095 s per
image[cite: 10]. These results indicate recall-first, precision-trade-off
behavior that benefits recall-sensitive applications such as far-field counting
and monitoring[cite: 10]. Ablation confirms that tiling exposes missed objects,
spatial clustering stabilizes geometry, semantic clustering enforces appearance
coherence, and reweighting provides calibrated integration with the
baseline[cite: 11]. The framework requires no retraining and integrates with
modern detectors[cite: 12]. Future work will reduce semantic gating cost and
extend the approach with temporal cues[cite: 13].

Conclusion: 通过控制信号引导注意力学习，关注诱导动作输出高方差的视觉特征而非仅仅最小化训练损失，可以获得更鲁棒和可泛化的策略

Abstract: Precise parking requires an end-to-end system where perception adaptively
provides policy-relevant details-especially in critical areas where fine
control decisions are essential. End-to-end learning offers a unified framework
by directly mapping sensor inputs to control actions, but existing approaches
lack effective synergy between perception and control. We find that
transformer-based self-attention, when used alone, tends to produce unstable
and temporally inconsistent spatial attention, which undermines the reliability
of downstream policy decisions over time. Instead, we propose CAA-Policy, an
end-to-end imitation learning system that allows control signal to guide the
learning of visual attention via a novel Control-Aided Attention (CAA)
mechanism. For the first time, we train such an attention module in a
self-supervised manner, using backpropagated gradients from the control outputs
instead of from the training loss. This strategy encourages the attention to
focus on visual features that induce high variance in action outputs, rather
than merely minimizing the training loss-a shift we demonstrate leads to a more
robust and generalizable policy. To further enhance stability, CAA-Policy
integrates short-horizon waypoint prediction as an auxiliary task, and
introduces a separately trained motion prediction module to robustly track the
target spot over time. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show that
\titlevariable~consistently surpasses both the end-to-end learning baseline and
the modular BEV segmentation + hybrid A* pipeline, achieving superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability. Code is released at

Abstract: Few-Shot Learning (FSL), which involves learning to generalize using only a
few data samples, has demonstrated promising and superior performances to
ordinary CNN methods. While Bayesian based estimation approaches using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence have shown improvements, they remain

Hellinger distance-based feature class aggregation scheme, demonstrating
resilience to adversarial perturbations up to $\epsilon=0.30$ and Gaussian
noise up to $\sigma=0.30$. The network achieves substantial improvements across
benchmark datasets, including gains of 1.20\% and 1.40\% for 1-shot and 5-shot

Similarity contrastive loss function that generalizes cosine similarity
contrastive loss for variational few-shot inference scenarios. Our approach

Abstract: Automated tools for video editing and assembly have applications ranging from

video editing work has mainly focused on either retrieval or user interfaces,
leaving actual editing to the user. In contrast, we propose to automate the
core task of video editing, formulating it as sequential decision making
process. Ours is a multi-agent approach. We design an Editor agent and a Critic
agent. The Editor takes as input a collection of video clips together with
natural language instructions and uses tools commonly found in video editing
software to produce an edited sequence. On the other hand, the Critic gives
natural language feedback to the editor based on the produced sequence or
renders it if it is satisfactory. We introduce a learning-based approach for
enabling effective communication across specialized agents to address the
language-driven video editing task. Finally, we explore an LLM-as-a-judge
metric for evaluating the quality of video editing system and compare it with
general human preference. We evaluate our system's output video sequences
qualitatively and quantitatively through a user study and find that our system
vastly outperforms existing approaches in terms of coverage, time constraint
satisfaction, and human preference.

Conclusion: 稳定性感知模型选择能够实现从非对比胶质瘤MRI可靠预测对比增强，减少对GBCAs的依赖并提高跨中心泛化能力，为神经肿瘤学及其他领域提供了可扩展的可重复ML模板。

Abstract: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are central to glioma imaging but
raise safety, cost, and accessibility concerns. Predicting contrast enhancement
from non-contrast MRI using machine learning (ML) offers a safer alternative,
as enhancement reflects tumor aggressiveness and informs treatment planning.
Yet scanner and cohort variability hinder robust model selection. We propose a
stability-aware framework to identify reproducible ML pipelines for multicenter
prediction of glioma MRI contrast enhancement. We analyzed 1,446 glioma cases
from four TCIA datasets (UCSF-PDGM, UPENN-GB, BRATS-Africa, BRATS-TCGA-LGG).
Non-contrast T1WI served as input, with enhancement derived from paired
post-contrast T1WI. Using PyRadiomics under IBSI standards, 108 features were
extracted and combined with 48 dimensionality reduction methods and 25
classifiers, yielding 1,200 pipelines. Rotational validation was trained on
three datasets and tested on the fourth. Cross-validation prediction accuracies
ranged from 0.91 to 0.96, with external testing achieving 0.87 (UCSF-PDGM),
0.98 (UPENN-GB), and 0.95 (BRATS-Africa), with an average of 0.93. F1,
precision, and recall were stable (0.87 to 0.96), while ROC-AUC varied more
widely (0.50 to 0.82), reflecting cohort heterogeneity. The MI linked with ETr
pipeline consistently ranked highest, balancing accuracy and stability. This
framework demonstrates that stability-aware model selection enables reliable
prediction of contrast enhancement from non-contrast glioma MRI, reducing
reliance on GBCAs and improving generalizability across centers. It provides a
scalable template for reproducible ML in neuro-oncology and beyond.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation enables models to recognize and segment
objects from arbitrary natural language descriptions, offering the flexibility
to handle novel, fine-grained, or functionally defined categories beyond fixed
label sets. While this capability is crucial for large-scale urban point clouds
that support applications such as digital twins, smart city management, and
urban analytics, it remains largely unexplored in this domain. The main
obstacles are the frequent absence of high-quality, well-aligned multi-view
imagery in large-scale urban point cloud datasets and the poor generalization
of existing three-dimensional (3D) segmentation pipelines across diverse urban
environments with substantial variation in geometry, scale, and appearance. To
address these challenges, we present OpenUrban3D, the first 3D open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that operates
without aligned multi-view images, pre-trained point cloud segmentation
networks, or manual annotations. Our approach generates robust semantic
features directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity
rendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced
fusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model. This design enables
zero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing both semantic
richness and geometric priors. Extensive experiments on large-scale urban
benchmarks, including SensatUrban and SUM, show that OpenUrban3D achieves
significant improvements in both segmentation accuracy and cross-scene
generalization over existing methods, demonstrating its potential as a flexible
and scalable solution for 3D urban scene understanding.

Abstract: Animal health monitoring and population management are critical aspects of
wildlife conservation and livestock management that increasingly rely on
automated detection and tracking systems. While Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
based systems combined with computer vision offer promising solutions for
non-invasive animal monitoring across challenging terrains, limited
availability of labeled training data remains an obstacle in developing
effective deep learning (DL) models for these applications. Transfer learning
has emerged as a potential solution, allowing models trained on large datasets
to be adapted for resource-limited scenarios such as those with limited data.
However, the vast landscape of pre-trained neural network architectures makes
it challenging to select optimal models, particularly for researchers new to
the field. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based
transfer learning framework that employs an upper confidence bound (UCB)
algorithm to automatically select the most suitable pre-trained model for
animal detection tasks. Our approach systematically evaluates and ranks
candidate models based on their performance, streamlining the model selection
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a higher
detection rate while requiring significantly less computational time compared
to traditional methods.

Abstract: Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is pivotal for analyzing complex, weakly
labeled datasets, such as whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology,
where bags comprise unordered collections of instances with sparse diagnostic
relevance. Traditional MIL approaches, including early statistical methods and
recent attention-based frameworks, struggle with instance redundancy and lack
explicit mechanisms for discarding non-informative instances, limiting their
robustness and interpretability. We propose Cluster-level Sparse MIL (csMIL), a
novel framework that integrates global-local instance clustering,
within-cluster attention, and cluster-level sparsity induction to address these
challenges. Our csMIL first performs global clustering across all bags to
establish $K$ cluster centers, followed by local clustering within each bag to
assign cluster labels. Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and
sparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective
retention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones.
This approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability
by identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that csMIL requires $O(s log K)$ bags to
recover $s$ relevant clusters, aligning with compressed sensing principles.
Empirically, csMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public
histopathology benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC).

Abstract: Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Detection (ZS-VAD) requires temporally localizing
anomalies without target domain training data, which is a crucial task due to
various practical concerns, e.g., data privacy or new surveillance deployments.
Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving
ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human
appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton
representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot
generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection
framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and
uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic
typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic
space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors
during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis
module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton
snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training
samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results
against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech,
UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has shown significant performance boost compared to
ordinary unimodal models across various domains. However, in real-world
scenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor
failures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models'
operation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to
reconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote
sensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first
examine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the
heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture
semantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class
variation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy
dependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model
robustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we
propose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with
three key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn
modality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness
(HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3)
Complementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by
encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks. Our method, GEMMNet,
outperforms both generative baselines AE, cGAN (conditional GAN), and
state-of-the-art non-generative approaches - mmformer and shaspec - on two
challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and
Potsdam). Source code is made available.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a critical task in
autonomous driving systems, assessing voxel-level geometry and semantics for
holistic scene perception. While existing voxel-based and plane-based SSC
methods have achieved considerable progress, they struggle to capture physical
regularities for realistic geometric details. On the other hand, neural
reconstruction methods like NeRF and 3DGS demonstrate superior physical
awareness, but suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence when
handling large-scale, complex autonomous driving scenes, leading to inferior
semantic accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-PHysical
Engaged REpresentation (SPHERE) for camera-based SSC, which integrates voxel
and Gaussian representations for joint exploitation of semantic and physical
information. First, the Semantic-guided Gaussian Initialization (SGI) module
leverages dual-branch 3D scene representations to locate focal voxels as
anchors to guide efficient Gaussian initialization. Then, the Physical-aware
Harmonics Enhancement (PHE) module incorporates semantic spherical harmonics to
model physical-aware contextual details and promote semantic-geometry
consistency through focal distribution alignment, generating SSC results with
realistic details. Extensive experiments and analyses on the popular
SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
SPHERE. The code is available at

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) remains highly sensitive to
geometric variability, where objects appear under arbitrary orientations,
scales, and perspective distortions. While equivariant architectures address
this issue, they typically require substantial computational resources and
restrict the hypothesis space. We revisit Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs)
as a canonicalization tool for transformer-based vision pipelines, emphasizing
their flexibility, backbone-agnostic nature, and lack of architectural
constraints. We propose a probabilistic, component-wise extension that improves
robustness. Specifically, we decompose affine transformations into rotation,
scaling, and shearing, and regress each component under geometric constraints
using a shared localization encoder. To capture uncertainty, we model each
component with a Gaussian variational posterior and perform sampling-based
canonicalization during inference.A novel component-wise alignment loss
leverages augmentation parameters to guide spatial alignment. Experiments on
challenging moth classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently improves robustness compared to other STNs.

Conclusion: 通过属性建模和跨域对齐，无需记忆样本即可有效减少知识遗忘同时缓解领域偏移，为CI-UDA任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a
model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the
sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint
and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in
avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes
during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works
cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store
and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid
catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between
classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will
continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in
knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve
domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task.
Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we
name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent
an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value
is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each
corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across
domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention
consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and
cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting
while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on
three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of synthetic dataset generation techniques,
evaluating the quality of synthetic data has become a critical research focus.
Robust evaluation not only drives innovations in data generation methods but
also guides researchers in optimizing the utilization of these synthetic
resources. However, current evaluation studies for synthetic datasets remain
limited, lacking a universally accepted standard framework. To address this,
this paper proposes a novel evaluation framework integrating generalized
cross-validation experiments and domain transfer learning principles, enabling
generalizable and comparable assessments of synthetic dataset quality. The
framework involves training task-specific models (e.g., YOLOv5s) on both
synthetic datasets and multiple real-world benchmarks (e.g., KITTI, BDD100K),
forming a cross-performance matrix. Following normalization, a Generalized
Cross-Validation (GCV) Matrix is constructed to quantify domain
transferability. The framework introduces two key metrics. One measures the
simulation quality by quantifying the similarity between synthetic data and
real-world datasets, while another evaluates the transfer quality by assessing
the diversity and coverage of synthetic data across various real-world
scenarios. Experimental validation on Virtual KITTI demonstrates the
effectiveness of our proposed framework and metrics in assessing synthetic data
fidelity. This scalable and quantifiable evaluation solution overcomes
traditional limitations, providing a principled approach to guide synthetic

Abstract: Unaligned Scene Change Detection aims to detect scene changes between image
pairs captured at different times without assuming viewpoint alignment. To
handle viewpoint variations, current methods rely solely on 2D visual cues to
establish cross-image correspondence to assist change detection. However, large
viewpoint changes can alter visual observations, causing appearance-based
matching to drift or fail. Additionally, supervision limited to 2D change masks
from small-scale SCD datasets restricts the learning of generalizable
multi-view knowledge, making it difficult to reliably identify visual overlaps
and handle occlusions. This lack of explicit geometric reasoning represents a
critical yet overlooked limitation. In this work, we are the first to leverage
geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model to address the core
challenges of unaligned SCD, including reliable identification of visual
overlaps, robust correspondence establishment, and explicit occlusion
detection. Building on these priors, we propose a training-free framework that
integrates them with the powerful representations of a visual foundation model
to enable reliable change detection under viewpoint misalignment. Through
extensive evaluation on the PSCD, ChangeSim, and PASLCD datasets, we
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior and robust performance. Our

Abstract: We present Stable Part Diffusion 4D (SP4D), a framework for generating paired
RGB and kinematic part videos from monocular inputs. Unlike conventional part
segmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns
to produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object
articulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch
diffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part
segmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different
part counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks
to continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to
share the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to
be recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion
Fusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a
contrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of
part predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted
to 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few
manual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K,
a curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from
Objaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part
video sequences. Experiments show that SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse
scenarios, including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare
articulated poses, producing kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream
animation and motion-related tasks.

training models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and
5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data
compared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the
granularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a
detrimental effect on performance. Our results highlight the importance of the
granularity of FST groups when training lesion classification models. Given the
question marks over possible human biases in the choice of categories in the
FST scale, this paper provides evidence for a move away from the FST scale in
fair AI research and a transition to an alternative scale that better
represents the diversity of human skin tones.

Abstract: 3D structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans are commonly
acquired in clinical settings to monitor a wide range of neurological
conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and stroke. While deep
learning models have shown promising results analyzing 3D MRI across a number
of brain imaging tasks, most are highly tailored for specific tasks with
limited labeled data, and are not able to generalize across tasks and/or
populations. The development of self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled the
creation of large medical foundation models that leverage diverse, unlabeled
datasets ranging from healthy to diseased data, showing significant success in
2D medical imaging applications. However, even the very few foundation models
for 3D brain MRI that have been developed remain limited in resolution, scope,
or accessibility. In this work, we present a general, high-resolution
SimCLR-based SSL foundation model for 3D brain structural MRI, pre-trained on
18,759 patients (44,958 scans) from 11 publicly available datasets spanning
diverse neurological diseases. We compare our model to Masked Autoencoders
(MAE), as well as two supervised baselines, on four diverse downstream
prediction tasks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Our
fine-tuned SimCLR model outperforms all other models across all tasks. Notably,
our model still achieves superior performance when fine-tuned using only 20% of
labeled training samples for predicting Alzheimer's disease. We use publicly
available code and data, and release our trained model at
https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/3D-Neuro-SimCLR, contributing a broadly
applicable and accessible foundation model for clinical brain MRI analysis.

Motivation: 解决从单张RGB图像重建高光谱图像这一病态问题，传统方法在相机光谱敏感性和场景光照信息不准确时会导致物理不一致性

Method: 将RGB-to-HSI重建建模为物理约束的逆问题，使用可学习变换域中的核范数正则化，显式估计CSS和光照参数，引入数据自适应的低秩子空间SVT操作器避免完整SVD计算

Result: 在标准基准测试中相比最先进的RGB-based方法在重建精度上取得一致改进

Conclusion: USCTNet通过物理约束和深度展开框架有效解决了RGB到HSI重建的物理一致性问题，同时保持了计算效率

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a single RGB image is
ill-posed and can become physically inconsistent when the camera spectral
sensitivity (CSS) and scene illumination are misspecified. We formulate
RGB-to-HSI reconstruction as a physics-grounded inverse problem regularized by
a nuclear norm in a learnable transform domain, and we explicitly estimate CSS
and illumination to define the forward operator embedded in each iteration,
ensuring colorimetric consistency. To avoid the cost and instability of full
singular-value decompositions (SVDs) required by singular-value thresholding
(SVT), we introduce a data-adaptive low-rank subspace SVT operator. Building on
these components, we develop USCTNet, a deep unfolding solver tailored to HSI
that couples a parameter estimation module with learnable proximal updates.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art RGB-based methods in reconstruction accuracy. Code:

Conclusion: SegSLR通过有效结合RGB和姿态信息，专注于关键身体部位的分割和处理，在孤立手语识别任务中取得了优异性能，验证了设计选择的有效性。

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) approaches primarily rely on RGB
data or signer pose information. However, combining these modalities often
results in the loss of crucial details, such as hand shape and orientation, due
to imprecise representations like bounding boxes. Therefore, we propose the
ISLR system SegSLR, which combines RGB and pose information through promptable
zero-shot video segmentation. Given the rough localization of the hands and the
signer's body from pose information, we segment the respective parts through
the video to maintain all relevant shape information. Subsequently, the
segmentations focus the processing of the RGB data on the most relevant body
parts for ISLR. This effectively combines RGB and pose information. Our
evaluation on the complex ChaLearn249 IsoGD dataset shows that SegSLR
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, ablation studies indicate
that SegSLR strongly benefits from focusing on the signer's body and hands,
justifying our design choices.

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效生成具有物理精确相机效应的训练数据，解决了现有数据生成方法成本高、仿真到真实差距大或无法准确建模相机效应的问题

Abstract: Common computer vision systems typically assume ideal pinhole cameras but
fail when facing real-world camera effects such as fisheye distortion and
rolling shutter, mainly due to the lack of learning from training data with
camera effects. Existing data generation approaches suffer from either high
costs, sim-to-real gaps or fail to accurately model camera effects. To address
this bottleneck, we propose 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing (4D-GRT), a novel two-stage
pipeline that combines 4D Gaussian Splatting with physically-based ray tracing
for camera effect simulation. Given multi-view videos, 4D-GRT first
reconstructs dynamic scenes, then applies ray tracing to generate videos with
controllable, physically accurate camera effects. 4D-GRT achieves the fastest
rendering speed while performing better or comparable rendering quality
compared to existing baselines. Additionally, we construct eight synthetic
dynamic scenes in indoor environments across four camera effects as a benchmark
to evaluate generated videos with camera effects.

Abstract: The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D
scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However,
existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity,

these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale
simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes
by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally
generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and

massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts
with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing
pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world
scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these
scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate
the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout
generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the
complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for
scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and
navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the
data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.

Abstract: LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation is essential for interpreting 3D
environments in applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Recent
methods achieve strong performance by exploiting different point cloud
representations or incorporating data from other sensors, such as cameras or
external datasets. However, these approaches often suffer from high
computational complexity and require large amounts of training data, limiting
their generalization in data-scarce scenarios. In this paper, we improve the
performance of point-based methods by effectively learning features from 2D
representations through point-plane projections, enabling the extraction of
complementary information while relying solely on LiDAR data. Additionally, we
introduce a geometry-aware technique for data augmentation that aligns with
LiDAR sensor properties and mitigates class imbalance. We implemented and
evaluated our method that applies point-plane projections onto multiple
informative 2D representations of the point cloud. Experiments demonstrate that
this approach leads to significant improvements in limited-data scenarios,
while also achieving competitive results on two publicly available standard
datasets, as SemanticKITTI and PandaSet. The code of our method is available at

Abstract: The burgeoning of online education has created an urgent need for robust and
scalable systems to ensure academic integrity during remote examinations.
Traditional human proctoring is often not feasible at scale, while existing
automated solutions can be intrusive or fail to detect a wide range of cheating
behaviors. This paper introduces AutoOEP (Automated Online Exam Proctoring), a
comprehensive, multi-modal framework that leverages computer vision and machine
learning to provide effective, automated proctoring. The system utilizes a
dual-camera setup to capture both a frontal view of the examinee and a side
view of the workspace, minimizing blind spots. Our approach integrates several
parallel analyses: the Face Module performs continuous identity verification
using ArcFace, along with head pose estimation, gaze tracking, and mouth
movement analysis to detect suspicious cues. Concurrently, the Hand Module
employs a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for detecting prohibited items (e.g., mobile
phones, notes) and tracks hand proximity to these objects. Features from these
modules are aggregated and fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
that analyzes temporal patterns to calculate a real-time cheating probability
score. We evaluate AutoOEP on a custom-collected dataset simulating diverse
exam conditions. Our system achieves an accuracy of 90.7% in classifying
suspicious activities. The object detection component obtains a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.57 for prohibited items, and the entire framework
processes video streams at approximately 2.4 frames per second without a GPU.
The results demonstrate that AutoOEP is an effective and resource-efficient
solution for automated proctoring, significantly reducing the need for human
intervention and enhancing the integrity of online assessments.

Abstract: Spectral imaging technology has long-faced fundamental challenges in
balancing spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. While compressive
sensing-based Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) mitigates this
trade-off through optical encoding, high compression ratios result in ill-posed
reconstruction problems. Traditional model-based methods exhibit limited
performance due to reliance on handcrafted inherent image priors, while deep
learning approaches are constrained by their black-box nature, which
compromises physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose
a dual-camera CASSI reconstruction framework that integrates total variation
(TV) subgradient theory. By establishing an end-to-end SD-CASSI mathematical
model, we reduce the computational complexity of solving the inverse problem
and provide a mathematically well-founded framework for analyzing multi-camera
systems. A dynamic regularization strategy is introduced, incorporating
normalized gradient constraints from RGB/panchromatic-derived reference images,
which constructs a TV subgradient similarity function with strict convex
optimization guarantees. Leveraging spatial priors from auxiliary cameras, an
adaptive reference generation and updating mechanism is designed to provide
subgradient guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively preserves spatial-spectral structural consistency. The theoretical
framework establishes an interpretable mathematical foundation for
computational spectral imaging, demonstrating robust performance across diverse
reconstruction scenarios. The source code is available at

Abstract: The FungiCLEF 2025 competition addresses the challenge of automatic fungal
species recognition using realistic, field-collected observational data.
Accurate identification tools support both mycologists and citizen scientists,
greatly enhancing large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Effective recognition
systems in this context must handle highly imbalanced class distributions and
provide reliable performance even when very few training samples are available
for many species, especially rare and under-documented taxa that are often
missing from standard training sets. According to competition organizers, about
20\% of all verified fungi observations, representing nearly 20,000 instances,
are associated with these rarely recorded species. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a robust deep learning method based on prototypical networks, which
enhances prototype representations for few-shot fungal classification. Our
prototypical network approach exceeds the competition baseline by more than 30
percentage points in Recall@5 on both the public (PB) and private (PR)
leaderboards. This demonstrates strong potential for accurately identifying
both common and rare fungal species, supporting the main objectives of

Abstract: We present a robust multi-modal framework for predicting traversability
costmaps for planetary rovers. Our model fuses camera and LiDAR data to produce
a bird's-eye-view (BEV) terrain costmap, trained self-supervised using
IMU-derived labels. Key updates include a DINOv3-based image encoder,
FiLM-based sensor fusion, and an optimization loss combining Huber and
smoothness terms. Experimental ablations (removing image color, occluding
inputs, adding noise) show only minor changes in MAE/MSE (e.g. MAE increases
from ~0.0775 to 0.0915 when LiDAR is sparsified), indicating that geometry
dominates the learned cost and the model is highly robust. We attribute the
small performance differences to the IMU labeling primarily reflecting terrain
geometry rather than semantics and to limited data diversity. Unlike prior work
claiming large gains, we emphasize our contributions: (1) a high-fidelity,
reproducible simulation environment; (2) a self-supervised IMU-based labeling
pipeline; and (3) a strong multi-modal BEV costmap prediction model. We discuss
limitations and future work such as domain generalization and dataset

Conclusion: LoRA方法能有效解决全景视频生成的适应问题，提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating high-quality 360{\deg} panoramic videos remains a significant
challenge due to the fundamental differences between panoramic and traditional
perspective-view projections. While perspective videos rely on a single
viewpoint with a limited field of view, panoramic content requires rendering
the full surrounding environment, making it difficult for standard video
generation models to adapt. Existing solutions often introduce complex
architectures or large-scale training, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal
results. Motivated by the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in style
transfer tasks, we propose treating panoramic video generation as an adaptation
problem from perspective views. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that LoRA can effectively model the transformation between these projections
when its rank exceeds the degrees of freedom in the task. Our approach
efficiently fine-tunes a pretrained video diffusion model using only
approximately 1,000 videos while achieving high-quality panoramic generation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains proper projection
geometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality,
left-right consistency, and motion diversity.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables fast, high-quality novel view synthesis
but typically relies on densification followed by pruning to optimize the
number of Gaussians. Existing mask-based pruning, such as MaskGS, regularizes
the global mean of the mask, which is misaligned with the local per-pixel
(per-ray) reconstruction loss that determines image quality along individual
camera rays. This paper introduces SVR-GS, a spatially variant regularizer that
renders a per-pixel spatial mask from each Gaussian's effective contribution
along the ray, thereby applying sparsity pressure where it matters: on
low-importance Gaussians. We explore three spatial-mask aggregation strategies,
implement them in CUDA, and conduct a gradient analysis to motivate our final
design. Extensive experiments on Tanks\&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360
datasets demonstrate that, on average across the three datasets, the proposed
SVR-GS reduces the number of Gaussians by 1.79\(\times\) compared to MaskGS and
5.63\(\times\) compared to 3DGS, while incurring only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR
drops, respectively. These gains translate into significantly smaller, faster,
and more memory-efficient models, making them well-suited for real-time
applications such as robotics, AR/VR, and mobile perception.

virtual reality systems. Traditional 3D reconstruction techniques based on 2D
images typically relies on RGB spectral information. With advances in sensor
technology, additional spectral bands beyond RGB have been increasingly
incorporated into 3D reconstruction workflows. Existing methods that integrate
these expanded spectral data often suffer from expensive scheme prices, low
accuracy and poor geometric features. Three - dimensional reconstruction based
on NeRF can effectively address the various issues in current multispectral 3D
reconstruction methods, producing high - precision and high - quality
reconstruction results. However, currently, NeRF and some improved models such
as NeRFacto are trained on three - band data and cannot take into account the
multi - band information. To address this problem, we propose
Multispectral-NeRF, an enhanced neural architecture derived from NeRF that can
effectively integrates multispectral information. Our technical contributions
comprise threefold modifications: Expanding hidden layer dimensionality to
accommodate 6-band spectral inputs; Redesigning residual functions to optimize
spectral discrepancy calculations between reconstructed and reference images;
Adapting data compression modules to address the increased bit-depth
requirements of multispectral imagery. Experimental results confirm that
Multispectral-NeRF successfully processes multi-band spectral features while
accurately preserving the original scenes' spectral characteristics.

Abstract: Image hiding is often referred to as steganography, which aims to hide a
secret image in a cover image of the same resolution. Many steganography models
are based on genera-tive adversarial networks (GANs) and variational
autoencoders (VAEs). However, most existing models suffer from mode collapse.
Mode collapse will lead to an information imbalance between the cover and
secret images in the stego image and further affect the subsequent extraction.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes StegOT, an autoencoder-based
steganography model incorporating optimal transport theory. We designed the
multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module to transform the feature
distribution, which exhibits multiple peaks, into a single peak to achieve the
trade-off of information. Experiments demonstrate that we not only achieve a
trade-off between the cover and secret images but also enhance the quality of
both the stego and recovery images. The source code will be released on

Abstract: Accurate tree segmentation is a key step in extracting individual tree
metrics from forest laser scans, and is essential to understanding ecosystem
functions in carbon cycling and beyond. Over the past decade, tree segmentation
algorithms have advanced rapidly due to developments in AI. However existing,
public, 3D forest datasets are not large enough to build robust tree
segmentation systems. Motivated by the success of synthetic data in other
domains such as self-driving, we investigate whether similar approaches can
help with tree segmentation. In place of expensive field data collection and
annotation, we use synthetic data during pretraining, and then require only
minimal, real forest plot annotation for fine-tuning.
  We have developed a new synthetic data generation pipeline to do this for
forest vision tasks, integrating advances in game-engines with physics-based
LiDAR simulation. As a result, we have produced a comprehensive, diverse,
annotated 3D forest dataset on an unprecedented scale. Extensive experiments
with a state-of-the-art tree segmentation algorithm and a popular real dataset
show that our synthetic data can substantially reduce the need for labelled
real data. After fine-tuning on just a single, real, forest plot of less than
0.1 hectare, the pretrained model achieves segmentations that are competitive
with a model trained on the full scale real data. We have also identified
critical factors for successful use of synthetic data: physics, diversity, and
scale, paving the way for more robust 3D forest vision systems in the future.
Our data generation pipeline and the resulting dataset are available at

Abstract: This paper presents MIS-LSTM, a hybrid framework that joins CNN encoders with
an LSTM sequence model for sleep quality and stress prediction at the day level
from multimodal lifelog data. Continuous sensor streams are first partitioned
into N-hour blocks and rendered as multi-channel images, while sparse discrete
events are encoded with a dedicated 1D-CNN. A Convolutional Block Attention
Module fuses the two modalities into refined block embeddings, which an LSTM
then aggregates to capture long-range temporal dependencies. To further boost
robustness, we introduce UALRE, an uncertainty-aware ensemble that overrides
lowconfidence majority votes with high-confidence individual predictions.
Experiments on the 2025 ETRI Lifelog Challenge dataset show that Our base
MISLSTM achieves Macro-F1 0.615; with the UALRE ensemble, the score improves to

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (ReID) has several challenges in real-world
surveillance systems due to clothing changes (CCReID) and the need for
maintaining continual learning (LReID). Previous existing methods either
develop models specifically for one application, which is mostly a same-cloth

will introduce the LReID-Hybrid task with the goal of developing a model to
achieve both SC and CC while learning in a continual setting. Mismatched
representations and forgetting from one task to the next are significant
issues, we address this with CMLReID, a CLIP-based framework composed of two
novel tasks: (1) Context-Aware Semantic Prompt (CASP) that generates adaptive
prompts, and also incorporates context to align richly multi-grained visual
cues with semantic text space; and (2) Adaptive Knowledge Fusion and Projection
(AKFP) which produces robust SC/CC prototypes through the use of a dual-path

Experiments performed on a wide range of datasets and illustrate that CMLReID

Conclusion: ROSGS通过结合2DGS几何重建和混合光照模型，有效解决了室外场景重光照的挑战，在精度和效率方面都表现出色

Abstract: Image data captured outdoors often exhibit unbounded scenes and
unconstrained, varying lighting conditions, making it challenging to decompose
them into geometry, reflectance, and illumination. Recent works have focused on
achieving this decomposition using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or the 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation but remain hindered by two key
limitations: the high computational overhead associated with neural networks of
NeRF and the use of low-frequency lighting representations, which often result
in inefficient rendering and suboptimal relighting accuracy. We propose ROSGS,
a two-stage pipeline designed to efficiently reconstruct relightable outdoor
scenes using the Gaussian Splatting representation. By leveraging monocular
normal priors, ROSGS first reconstructs the scene's geometry with the compact
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) representation, providing an efficient and
accurate geometric foundation. Building upon this reconstructed geometry, ROSGS
then decomposes the scene's texture and lighting through a hybrid lighting
model. This model effectively represents typical outdoor lighting by employing
a spherical Gaussian function to capture the directional, high-frequency
components of sunlight, while learning a radiance transfer function via
Spherical Harmonic coefficients to model the remaining low-frequency skylight
comprehensively. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons
demonstrate that ROSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting
outdoor scenes and highlight its ability to deliver superior relighting
accuracy and rendering efficiency.

Abstract: Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT).
  It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their
positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and
identity switches.
  The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of
the most commonly used methods in MOT.
  However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are
mismatched and objects move in non-stationary.
  In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion
estimation of MOT.
  In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet
(SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a
Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps.
  First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves
along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state
vectors to encode independent semantic information.
  Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to
encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between
heterogeneous-semantic elements.
  To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in
MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several
open-source MOT datasets.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the
traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing
learning-aided filters.

Abstract: Diminished reality (DR) refers to the digital removal of real-world objects
by compositing background content in their place. This thesis presents a
real-time, inpainting-based DR system designed to enable privacy control in
shared-space mixed reality (MR) meetings. The system allows a primary headset
user to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment,
ensuring that those objects are no longer visible to other participants.
Removal is achieved through semantic segmentation and precise object selection,
followed by real-time inpainting from the viewpoint of a secondary observer,
implemented using a mobile ZED 2i depth camera. The solution is designed to be
portable and robust, requiring neither a fixed secondary viewpoint nor prior 3D
scanning of the environment. The system utilises YOLOv11 for object detection
and a modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model for
high-quality video inpainting. At 720p resolution, the pipeline sustains frame
rates exceeding 20 fps, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time diminished
reality for practical privacy-preserving MR applications.

Abstract: Glioma, an aggressive brain malignancy characterized by rapid progression and
its poor prognosis, poses significant challenges for accurate evolution
prediction. These challenges are exacerbated by sparse, irregularly acquired
longitudinal MRI data in clinical practice, where incomplete follow-up
sequences create data imbalances and make reliable modeling difficult. In this
paper, we present a multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic, pixel-wise
prediction of glioma progression. The model simultaneously generates future
FLAIR sequences at any chosen time point and estimates spatial probabilistic
tumor evolution maps derived using signed distance fields (SDFs), allowing
uncertainty quantification. To capture temporal dynamics of tumor evolution
across arbitrary intervals, we integrate a pretrained deformation module that
models inter-scan changes using deformation fields. Regarding the common
clinical limitation of data scarcity, we implement a targeted augmentation
pipeline that synthesizes complete sequences of three follow-up scans and
imputes missing MRI modalities from available patient studies, improving the
stability and accuracy of predictive models. Based on merely two follow-up
scans at earlier timepoints, our framework produces flexible time-depending
probability maps, enabling clinicians to interrogate tumor progression risks at
any future temporal milestone. We further introduce a radiotherapy-weighted
focal loss term that leverages radiation dose maps, as these highlight regions
of greater clinical importance during model training. The proposed method was
trained on a public dataset and evaluated on an internal private dataset,
achieving promising results in both cases

Abstract: Rigid-motion artifacts, such as cortical bone streaking and trabecular
smearing, hinder in vivo assessment of bone microstructures in high-resolution
peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Despite various motion
grading techniques, no motion correction methods exist due to the lack of
standardized degradation models. We optimize a conventional sinogram-based
method to simulate motion artifacts in HR-pQCT images, creating paired datasets
of motion-corrupted images and their corresponding ground truth, which enables
seamless integration into supervised learning frameworks for motion correction.
As such, we propose an Edge-enhanced Self-attention Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (ESWGAN-GP) to address motion
artifacts in both simulated (source) and real-world (target) datasets. The
model incorporates edge-enhancing skip connections to preserve trabecular edges
and self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, facilitating
motion correction. A visual geometry group (VGG)-based perceptual loss is used
to reconstruct fine micro-structural features. The ESWGAN-GP achieves a mean
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 26.78, structural similarity index measure
(SSIM) of 0.81, and visual information fidelity (VIF) of 0.76 for the source
dataset, while showing improved performance on the target dataset with an SNR
of 29.31, SSIM of 0.87, and VIF of 0.81. The proposed methods address a
simplified representation of real-world motion that may not fully capture the
complexity of in vivo motion artifacts. Nevertheless, because motion artifacts
present one of the foremost challenges to more widespread adoption of this
modality, these methods represent an important initial step toward implementing
deep learning-based motion correction in HR-pQCT.

and dynamical abundances, which emphasizes the critical temporal information.
However, existing methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependency,
thus fail to capture the dynamical material evolution. Motivated by the ability
of copula theory in modeling dependency structure explicitly, in this paper, we
propose a copula-guided temporal dependency method (Cog-TD) for multitemporal
hyperspectral unmixing. Cog-TD defines new mathematical model, constructs
copula-guided framework and provides two key modules with theoretical support.
The mathematical model provides explicit formulations for MTHU problem
definition, which describes temporal dependency structure by incorporating
copula theory. The copula-guided framework is constructed for utilizing copula
function, which estimates dynamical endmembers and abundances with temporal
dependency. The key modules consist of copula function estimation and temporal
dependency guidance, which computes and employs temporal information to guide
unmixing process. Moreover, the theoretical support demonstrates that estimated
copula function is valid and the represented temporal dependency exists in
hyperspectral images. The major contributions of this paper include redefining
MTHU problem with temporal dependency, proposing a copula-guided framework,
developing two key modules and providing theoretical support. Our experimental
results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of
the proposed method.

TL;DR: 3DAeroRelief是第一个专门为灾后评估设计的3D基准数据集，使用低成本无人机采集飓风灾区数据，包含密集3D点云和语义标注，用于评估3D分割模型在灾害响应中的表现。


<details>

Motivation: 现有3D基准主要关注城市或室内场景，缺乏针对灾区的3D数据集。2D图像在灾害评估中存在深度缺失、遮挡和空间上下文有限的问题，需要3D语义分割提供更丰富的替代方案。

Method: 使用低成本无人机在飓风灾区采集数据，通过运动结构和多视角立体技术重建密集3D点云。通过手动2D标注并投影到3D空间生成语义标注。

Result: 创建了3DAeroRelief数据集，包含大规模室外环境的3D点云和细粒度结构损伤标注。评估了多个先进3D分割模型，展示了在灾害响应中3D场景理解的挑战和机遇。

Conclusion: 该数据集为推进灾后场景中稳健3D视觉系统的实际应用提供了宝贵资源，无人机在危险区域的低成本、灵活和安全数据收集使其特别适合应急场景。

Abstract: Timely assessment of structural damage is critical for disaster response and
recovery. However, most prior work in natural disaster analysis relies on 2D
imagery, which lacks depth, suffers from occlusions, and provides limited
spatial context. 3D semantic segmentation offers a richer alternative, but
existing 3D benchmarks focus mainly on urban or indoor scenes, with little
attention to disaster-affected areas. To address this gap, we present
3DAeroRelief--the first 3D benchmark dataset specifically designed for
post-disaster assessment. Collected using low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) over hurricane-damaged regions, the dataset features dense 3D point
clouds reconstructed via Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo
techniques. Semantic annotations were produced through manual 2D labeling and
projected into 3D space. Unlike existing datasets, 3DAeroRelief captures 3D
large-scale outdoor environments with fine-grained structural damage in
real-world disaster contexts. UAVs enable affordable, flexible, and safe data
collection in hazardous areas, making them particularly well-suited for
emergency scenarios. To demonstrate the utility of 3DAeroRelief, we evaluate
several state-of-the-art 3D segmentation models on the dataset to highlight
both the challenges and opportunities of 3D scene understanding in disaster
response. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing robust 3D
vision systems in real-world applications for post-disaster scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a pipeline to extract and reconstruct dynamic 3D smoke assets from

smoke design and editing. Recent developments in 3D vision have significantly
improved reconstructing and rendering fluid dynamics, supporting realistic and
temporally consistent view synthesis. However, current fluid reconstructions
rely heavily on carefully controlled clean lab environments, whereas real-world
videos captured in the wild are largely underexplored. We pinpoint three key
challenges of reconstructing smoke in real-world videos and design targeted
techniques, including smoke extraction with background removal, initialization
of smoke particles and camera poses, and inferring multi-view videos. Our
method not only outperforms previous reconstruction and generation methods with
high-quality smoke reconstructions (+2.22 average PSNR on wild videos), but
also enables diverse and realistic editing of fluid dynamics by simulating our

Abstract: Effective reef monitoring requires the quantification of coral growth via
accurate volumetric and surface area estimates, which is a challenging task due
to the complex morphology of corals. We propose a novel, lightweight, and
scalable learning framework that addresses this challenge by predicting the 3D
volume and surface area of coral-like objects from 2D multi-view RGB images.
Our approach utilizes a pre-trained module (VGGT) to extract dense point maps
from each view; these maps are merged into a unified point cloud and enriched
with per-view confidence scores. The resulting cloud is fed to two parallel
DGCNN decoder heads, which jointly output the volume and the surface area of
the coral, as well as their corresponding confidence estimate. To enhance
prediction stability and provide uncertainty estimates, we introduce a
composite loss function based on Gaussian negative log-likelihood in both real
and log domains. Our method achieves competitive accuracy and generalizes well
to unseen morphologies. This framework paves the way for efficient and scalable
coral geometry estimation directly from a sparse set of images, with potential
applications in coral growth analysis and reef monitoring.

Abstract: Cattle identification is critical for efficient livestock farming management,
currently reliant on radio-frequency identification (RFID) ear tags. However,
RFID-based systems are prone to failure due to loss, damage, tampering, and
vulnerability to external attacks. As a robust alternative, biometric
identification using cattle muzzle patterns similar to human fingerprints has
emerged as a promising solution. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated
success in leveraging these unique patterns for accurate identification. But
deep learning models face significant challenges, including limited data
availability, disruptions during data collection, and dynamic herd compositions
that require frequent model retraining. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework for real-time cattle
identification using Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with
Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as a feature extractor model. This
model offers great model adaptability to new data through efficient learning
from few data samples without retraining. The proposed approach has been
rigorously evaluated against current state-of-the-art few-shot learning
techniques applied in cattle identification. Comprehensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF has superior cattle
identification performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores.

Conclusion: SMILE提供了渐进式理论支持，设计了超分辨率指导下的解混新框架，实验证明了其有用性。

Abstract: The performance of hyperspectral unmixing may be constrained by low spatial
resolution, which can be enhanced using super-resolution in a multitask
learning way. However, integrating super-resolution and unmixing directly may
suffer two challenges: Task affinity is not verified, and the convergence of
unmixing is not guaranteed. To address the above issues, in this paper, we
provide theoretical analysis and propose super-resolution guided multi-task
learning method for hyperspectral unmixing (SMILE). The provided theoretical
analysis validates feasibility of multitask learning way and verifies task
affinity, which consists of relationship and existence theorems by proving the
positive guidance of super-resolution. The proposed framework generalizes
positive information from super-resolution to unmixing by learning both shared
and specific representations. Moreover, to guarantee the convergence, we
provide the accessibility theorem by proving the optimal solution of unmixing.
The major contributions of SMILE include providing progressive theoretical
support, and designing a new framework for unmixing under the guidance of
super-resolution. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have

TL;DR: 研究发现不同GPT模型在评估视觉语言描述时展现出独特的"评估个性"：GPT-4o-mini系统一致但方差小，GPT-4o擅长错误检测，GPT-5极度保守且变异性高。所有GPT模型都表现出2:1的负面评估偏好，这种模式是家族特性而非通用AI架构特征。

Motivation: 随着AI系统越来越多地评估其他AI输出，理解其评估行为对于防止级联偏见变得至关重要。研究旨在揭示不同AI模型在评估任务中表现出的固有评估策略和偏见。

Result: GPT模型展现出不同的评估个性：GPT-4o-mini系统一致，GPT-4o擅长错误检测，GPT-5极度保守。所有GPT模型都表现出2:1的负面评估偏见。跨家族分析显示GPT模型高度相似而Gemini评估策略显著不同。

Conclusion: 评估能力并不随通用能力线性扩展，稳健的AI评估需要多样化的架构视角。评估个性是模型的固有属性而非人为产物。

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly evaluate other AI outputs, understanding their
assessment behavior becomes crucial for preventing cascading biases. This study
analyzes vision-language descriptions generated by NVIDIA's Describe Anything
Model and evaluated by three GPT variants (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5) to
uncover distinct "evaluation personalities" the underlying assessment
strategies and biases each model demonstrates. GPT-4o-mini exhibits systematic
consistency with minimal variance, GPT-4o excels at error detection, while
GPT-5 shows extreme conservatism with high variability. Controlled experiments
using Gemini 2.5 Pro as an independent question generator validate that these
personalities are inherent model properties rather than artifacts. Cross-family
analysis through semantic similarity of generated questions reveals significant
divergence: GPT models cluster together with high similarity while Gemini
exhibits markedly different evaluation strategies. All GPT models demonstrate a
consistent 2:1 bias favoring negative assessment over positive confirmation,
though this pattern appears family-specific rather than universal across AI
architectures. These findings suggest that evaluation competence does not scale
with general capability and that robust AI assessment requires diverse
architectural perspectives.

Conclusion: HaPLa揭示了LLM安全防护的根本性挑战，现有方法难以平衡安全性和实用性，需要更深入的安全机制研究

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, but their potential misuse for harmful purposes remains a
significant concern. To strengthen defenses against such vulnerabilities, it is
essential to investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic
weaknesses in the architecture and learning paradigms of LLMs. In response, we
propose \textbf{H}armful \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{La}undering (HaPLa), a novel
and broadly applicable jailbreaking technique that requires only black-box
access to target models. HaPLa incorporates two primary strategies: 1)
\textit{abductive framing}, which instructs LLMs to infer plausible
intermediate steps toward harmful activities, rather than directly responding
to explicit harmful queries; and 2) \textit{symbolic encoding}, a lightweight
and flexible approach designed to obfuscate harmful content, given that current
LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords. Experimental
results show that HaPLa achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series
models and 70% across all targets. Further analysis with diverse symbolic
encoding rules also reveals a fundamental challenge: it remains difficult to
safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in
responding to benign queries.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown
remarkable performance across various tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, recent studies have highlighted the risk of private data leakage
through the prompt in ICL, especially when LLMs are exposed to malicious
attacks. While differential privacy (DP) provides strong privacy guarantees, it
often significantly reduces the utility of in-context learning (ICL). To
address this challenge, we incorporate task-related public data into the ICL
framework while maintaining the DP guarantee. Based on this approach, we
propose a private in-context learning algorithm that effectively balances
privacy protection and model utility. Through experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach significantly improves the utility of private ICL with the
assistance of public data. Additionally, we show that our method is robust

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate natural language rationales --
free-form explanations that help improve performance on complex reasoning tasks
and enhance interpretability for human users. However, evaluating these
rationales remains challenging. While recent work has relied on binary
preference judgments from humans or LLM judges, such evaluations are often
opaque and coarse-grained, offering limited insight into what makes one
rationale better than another. In this work, we rethink preference evaluation
for LLM-generated rationales by asking: (1) What attributes define good
rationales? (2) Can human preferences be explained by these attributes? (3) Can
attribute-based evaluation overcome the limitations of binary comparisons? We
identify a set of key rationale attributes from prior literature and assess
them using automatic metrics, LLM judgments, and human annotations. We then
analyze two standard human preference datasets MT Bench and Chatbot Arena using
SHAP to identify which attributes best explain human preference outcomes.
Finally, we re-evaluate model-generated rationales using attribute-specific ELO
scores, revealing more nuanced model comparisons and insights. Our findings
suggest that fine-grained attribute evaluations can better characterize
rationale quality and guide future research toward more interpretable and
reliable evaluation practices.

Conclusion: Free-MAD通过消除共识需求和引入新的决策机制，有效解决了传统MAD方法的局限性，为LLM推理提供了更高效可靠的框架。

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) is an emerging approach to improving the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing MAD methods rely on
multiple rounds of interaction among agents to reach consensus, and the final
output is selected by majority voting in the last round. However, this
consensus-based design faces several limitations. First, multiple rounds of
communication increases token overhead and limits scalability. Second, due to
the inherent conformity of LLMs, agents that initially produce correct
responses may be influenced by incorrect ones during the debate process,
causing error propagation. Third, majority voting introduces randomness and
unfairness in the decision-making phase, and can degrade the reasoning
performance.
  To address these issues, we propose \textsc{Free-MAD}, a novel MAD framework
that eliminates the need for consensus among agents. \textsc{Free-MAD}
introduces a novel score-based decision mechanism that evaluates the entire
debate trajectory rather than relying on the last round only. This mechanism
tracks how each agent's reasoning evolves, enabling more accurate and fair
outcomes. In addition, \textsc{Free-MAD} reconstructs the debate phase by
introducing anti-conformity, a mechanism that enables agents to mitigate
excessive influence from the majority. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets
demonstrate that \textsc{Free-MAD} significantly improves reasoning performance
while requiring only a single-round debate and thus reducing token costs. We
also show that compared to existing MAD approaches, \textsc{Free-MAD} exhibits
improved robustness in real-world attack scenarios.

Abstract: The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) shifts rapidly towards dynamic,
multi-agent systems. This introduces a fundamental challenge in establishing
computational trust, specifically how one agent can verify that another's
output was genuinely produced by a claimed LLM, and not falsified or generated
by a cheaper or inferior model. To address this challenge, this paper proposes
a verification framework that achieves tractable asymmetric effort, where the
cost to verify a computation is substantially lower than the cost to perform
it. Our approach is built upon the principle of deterministic replicability, a
property inherent to autoregressive models that strictly necessitates a
computationally homogeneous environment where all agents operate on identical
hardware and software stacks. Within this defined context, our framework
enables multiple validators to probabilistically audit small, random segments
of an LLM's output and it distributes the verification workload effectively.
The simulations demonstrated that targeted verification can be over 12 times
faster than full regeneration, with tunable parameters to adjust the detection
probability. By establishing a tractable mechanism for auditable LLM systems,
our work offers a foundational layer for responsible AI and serves as a
cornerstone for future research into the more complex, heterogeneous
multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong
capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks
often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple
queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the
efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these

dynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM
assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three
interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty
estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM
router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows,
DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO
outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging large language models (LLMs),
but existing methods often rely on a single optimization trajectory, limiting
adaptability and efficiency while suffering from narrow perspectives, gradient
conflicts, and high computational cost. We propose MAPGD (Multi-Agent Prompt
Gradient Descent), a framework integrating multi-agent collaboration with
gradient-based optimization. MAPGD features specialized agents for task
clarity, example selection, format design, and stylistic refinement; semantic
gradient coordination to resolve conflicts; bandit-based candidate selection
for efficient exploration-exploitation; and theoretical convergence guarantees.
Experiments on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks show MAPGD
outperforms single-agent and random baselines in accuracy and efficiency.
Ablations confirm the benefits of gradient fusion, agent specialization, and
conflict resolution, providing a unified, gradient-inspired multi-agent
approach to robust and interpretable prompt optimization.

Motivation: 解决现有医疗信息系统学习使用困难、操作复杂的问题，利用LLM智能体技术实现自然语言驱动的临床工作流自动化

Method: 开发MedicalOS作为领域特定的抽象层，将人类指令翻译为预定义的医疗命令（患者查询、病史检索、检查管理等），使用Python、API等工具包装

Result: 在22个专科的214个病例上验证，表现出高诊断准确性、临床合理的检查请求、结构化报告和药物推荐的一致性生成

Conclusion: MedicalOS为临床实践中的工作流自动化提供了可信赖和可扩展的基础

Abstract: Decades' advances in digital health technologies, such as electronic health
records, have largely streamlined routine clinical processes. Yet, most these
systems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of
managing multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating
complicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on
administration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large
language model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding
and computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with
operating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing
agents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an
abstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language
into machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a
more domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical
guidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and
compliance. To address this need, we present \textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified
agent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract
layer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital
healthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam
management, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped
as off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP,
Linux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22
specialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically
sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and
medication recommendations. These results highlight MedicalOS as a trustworthy
and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice.

TL;DR: MCFR是一个神经符号框架，将LLMs与模型检查结合，通过将自然语言转换为形式规范并在转换模型上进行验证，提高封闭领域QA中的推理忠实性和可解释性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有LLMs在推理任务中生成的推理轨迹往往不忠实，更像是合理的解释而非因果推导。虽然LLMs与符号引擎结合提高了可靠性，但仍局限于静态逻辑形式，难以处理动态的、基于状态的多步推理和条件转换。

Method: 提出MCFR框架，整合LLMs和模型检查技术，将自然语言问题转换为形式规范，并在转换模型上进行属性验证。创建了EduMC-QA基准数据集进行评估。

Result: MCFR显著提高了推理的忠实性和可解释性，为高风险封闭领域应用中的可验证QA提供了可行路径。与ChatGPT、DeepSeek和Claude等先进LLMs相比表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: MCFR框架通过神经符号方法有效解决了LLMs在动态状态推理中的局限性，为高可靠性要求的封闭领域QA系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for closed-domain QA systems in which procedural
correctness and policy compliance are critical. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work
reveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful - serving more as
plausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to
combine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved
reliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with
dynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional
transitions.
  In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a
neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support
property verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal
specifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation,
we introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic
procedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and
interpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes
closed-domain applications. In addition to evaluating MCFR, we compare its
performance with state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude to
contextualize its effectiveness.

Motivation: 当前智能体研究主要关注模型和数据规模的扩展，但忽略了在环境中扩展智能体推理结构、保真度和逻辑一致性的重要性。环境不仅是测试场地，更是需要智能体展现自适应、复杂和自主决策能力的挑战性条件。

Method: 采用神经符号多智能体架构，将个体智能体的信念状态形式化为Kripke模型，使用模态逻辑进行可能性与必然性推理。利用不可变的领域特定知识作为逻辑约束，指导语言模型的假设生成，防止得出物理或逻辑上不可行的结论。

Abstract: The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language
models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require
intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing
grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit
very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous
capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets
has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the
structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these
environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This
paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief
states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This
foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of
\emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal
logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make
infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for
proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively
guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from
reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity
simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses
complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs
with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world
model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable
autonomous agents.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to the implicit
reasoning risk, wherein innocuous unimodal inputs synergistically assemble into
risky multimodal data that produce harmful outputs. We attribute this
vulnerability to the difficulty of MLLMs maintaining safety alignment through
long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce
Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI), the first dataset featuring
interpretable reasoning paths tailored for such a cross-modal challenge. A
novel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is
also designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning
process with human safety values. Experimental results show that our

Conclusion: 最优协作存在于人类和AI能力的交集而非并集，验证了从单方向对齐到共对齐范式的转变必要性。

Abstract: Current AI alignment through RLHF follows a single directional paradigm that
AI conforms to human preferences while treating human cognition as fixed. We
propose a shift to co-alignment through Bidirectional Cognitive Alignment

representation mapping, and KL-budget constraints for controlled co-evolution.
In collaborative navigation, BiCA achieved 85.5% success versus 70.3% baseline,
with 230% better mutual adaptation and 332% better protocol convergence.
Emergent protocols outperformed handcrafted ones by 84%, while bidirectional
adaptation unexpectedly improved safety (+23% out-of-distribution robustness).

Result: GPT-4在60%的案例中排名第一诊断，84%进入前十，超越20名医生基线；在图像任务上准确率为67%；医生在盲测中74%无法区分AI和人类生成的鉴别诊断。

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂文本诊断方面超越医生表现，能有效模拟专家医学演示，但图像解释和文献检索仍是弱点。CPC-Bench和CaBot有助于持续追踪医学AI进展。

Abstract: BACKGROUND: For over a century, the New England Journal of Medicine
Clinicopathological Conferences (CPCs) have tested the reasoning of expert
physicians and, recently, artificial intelligence (AI). However, prior AI
evaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted
reasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.
  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025),
we conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create
CPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and
multimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models
(LLMs). Then, we developed "Dr. CaBot," an AI discussant designed to produce
written and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,
modeling the role of the human expert in these cases.
  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the
final diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,
outperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached
98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per
unit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image
tasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image
challenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text,
physicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of
trials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote
research, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.
  CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based
differential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations,
but image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and
CaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI.

Abstract: Current general-purpose large language models (LLMs) commonly exhibit
knowledge hallucination and insufficient domain-specific adaptability in
domain-specific tasks, limiting their effectiveness in specialized question
answering scenarios. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) effectively tackles
these challenges by integrating external knowledge to enhance accuracy and
relevance. However, traditional RAG still faces limitations in domain knowledge
accuracy and context modeling.To enhance domain-specific question answering
performance, this work focuses on a graph-based RAG framework, emphasizing the
critical role of knowledge graph quality during the generation process. We
propose DSRAG (Domain-Specific RAG), a multimodal knowledge graph-driven
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed for domain-specific
applications. Our approach leverages domain-specific documents as the primary
knowledge source, integrating heterogeneous information such as text, images,
and tables to construct a multimodal knowledge graph covering both conceptual
and instance layers. Building on this foundation, we introduce semantic pruning
and structured subgraph retrieval mechanisms, combining knowledge graph context
and vector retrieval results to guide the language model towards producing more
reliable responses. Evaluations using the Langfuse multidimensional scoring
mechanism show that our method excels in domain-specific question answering,
validating the efficacy of integrating multimodal knowledge graphs with
retrieval-augmented generation.

orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function

significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with
the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the

Abstract: Difficult decision-making problems abound in various disciplines and domains.
The proliferation of generative techniques, especially large language models
(LLMs), has excited interest in using them for decision support. However, LLMs
cannot yet resolve missingness in their training data, leading to
hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by
incorporating external information retrieval, reducing hallucinations and
improving accuracy. Yet, RAG and related methods are only partial solutions, as
they may lack access to all necessary sources or key missing information. Even
everyday issues often challenge LLMs' abilities. Submitting longer prompts with
context and examples is one approach to address knowledge gaps, but designing
effective prompts is non-trivial and may not capture complex mental models of
domain experts. For tasks with missing critical information, LLMs are
insufficient, as are many existing systems poorly represented in available
documents. This paper explores how LLMs can make decision-making more
efficient, using a running example of evaluating whether to respond to a call
for proposals. We propose a technology based on optimized human-machine
dialogue and monotone Boolean and k-valued functions to discover a
computationally tractable personal expert mental model (EMM) of
decision-making. Our EMM algorithm for LLM prompt engineering has four steps:
(1) factor identification, (2) hierarchical structuring of factors, (3)
generating a generalized expert mental model specification, and (4) generating
a detailed generalized expert mental model from that specification.

hierarchical medical knowledge injection without real medical records. Then, to
optimize the virtual patient's interaction abilities with humans, Patient-Zero
designs a dynamic updating mechanism to improve the consistency and

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in emulating
human-like responses across a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel alignment framework that treats LLMs as agent proxies for human survey
respondents, affording a cost-effective and steerable solution to two pressing
challenges in the social sciences: the rising cost of survey deployment and the
growing demographic imbalance in survey response data. Drawing inspiration from
the theory of revealed preference, we formulate alignment as a two-stage
problem: constructing diverse agent personas called endowments that simulate
plausible respondent profiles, and selecting a representative subset to
approximate a ground-truth population based on observed data. To implement the
paradigm, we introduce P2P, a system that steers LLM agents toward
representative behavioral patterns using structured prompt engineering,
entropy-based sampling, and regression-based selection. Unlike
personalization-heavy approaches, our alignment approach is
demographic-agnostic and relies only on aggregate survey results, offering
better generalizability and parsimony. Beyond improving data efficiency in
social science research, our framework offers a testbed for studying the
operationalization of pluralistic alignment. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach on real-world opinion survey datasets, showing that our aligned agent
populations can reproduce aggregate response patterns with high fidelity and
exhibit substantial response diversity, even without demographic conditioning.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical diagnostic
workflows requires robust and consistent evaluation methods to ensure
reliability, clinical relevance, and the inherent variability in expert
judgments. Traditional metrics like precision and recall often fail to account
for the inherent variability in expert judgments, leading to inconsistent
assessments of AI performance. Inter-rater agreement statistics like Cohen's
Kappa are more reliable but they lack interpretability. We introduce Relative
Precision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD and RRAD) - a new
evaluation metrics that compare AI outputs against multiple expert opinions
rather than a single reference. By normalizing performance against inter-expert
disagreement, these metrics provide a more stable and realistic measure of the
quality of predicted diagnosis. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of
diagnostic quality measures, our study contains a very important side result.
Our evaluation methodology allows us to avoid selecting diagnoses from a
limited list when evaluating a given case. Instead, both the models being
tested and the examiners verifying them arrive at a free-form diagnosis. In
this automated methodology for establishing the identity of free-form clinical
diagnoses, a remarkable 98% accuracy becomes attainable. We evaluate our
approach using 360 medical dialogues, comparing multiple large language models
(LLMs) against a panel of physicians. Large-scale study shows that
top-performing models, such as DeepSeek-V3, achieve consistency on par with or
exceeding expert consensus. Moreover, we demonstrate that expert judgments
exhibit significant variability - often greater than that between AI and

supports the need to adopt relative metrics in medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI新技术可以深入分析国家供应链，但真正有意义的洞察需要及时持续更新和聚合海量数据。LLMs虽然提供前所未有的分析机会，但其知识库受限于模型最后训练日期，无法处理依赖新兴及时信息的任务。

Method: 整合新兴的检索增强生成(RAG)预处理和检索技术与先进的网络爬虫技术，通过实验评估这些技术的组合效果在及时性和质量之间的权衡。

Result: 在供应链分析中应用RAG系统时，微调嵌入检索模型始终提供最显著的性能提升；自适应迭代检索根据上下文动态调整检索深度，进一步提升了性能；微调LLM改进有限且资源成本更高；向下查询抽象在实践中显著优于向上抽象。

Conclusion: 检索质量对RAG系统性能至关重要，微调嵌入模型和自适应检索策略是提升供应链分析时效性和质量的关键技术。

Abstract: New technologies in generative AI can enable deeper analysis into our
nation's supply chains but truly informative insights require the continual
updating and aggregation of massive data in a timely manner. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented analytical opportunities however, their
knowledge base is constrained to the models' last training date, rendering
these capabilities unusable for organizations whose mission impacts rely on
emerging and timely information. This research proposes an innovative approach
to supply chain analysis by integrating emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) preprocessing and retrieval techniques with advanced web-scraping
technologies. Our method aims to reduce latency in incorporating new
information into an augmented-LLM, enabling timely analysis of supply chain
disruptors. Through experimentation, this study evaluates the combinatorial
effects of these techniques towards timeliness and quality trade-offs. Our
results suggest that in applying RAG systems to supply chain analysis,
fine-tuning the embedding retrieval model consistently provides the most
significant performance gains, underscoring the critical importance of
retrieval quality. Adaptive iterative retrieval, which dynamically adjusts
retrieval depth based on context, further enhances performance, especially on
complex supply chain queries. Conversely, fine-tuning the LLM yields limited
improvements and higher resource costs, while techniques such as downward query
abstraction significantly outperforms upward abstraction in practice.

Conclusion: 这项工作为实现AI-生物学合作伙伴关系提供了具体步骤，其中语言可以替代数学目标函数、固定规则和领域特定编程。

Abstract: Human language is one of the most expressive tools for conveying intent, yet
most artificial or biological systems lack mechanisms to interpret or respond
meaningfully to it. Bridging this gap could enable more natural forms of
control over complex, decentralized systems. In AI and artificial life, recent
work explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still
depend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets,
limiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in
synthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often
genomic rather than environmental perturbation.
  A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be
guided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or
carefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by
showing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be
guided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative
prompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI
model scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and
the former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.
  Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness
functions or domain-specific prompt design. We show that the evolved system
generalizes to unseen prompts without retraining. By treating natural language
as a control layer, the system suggests a future in which spoken or written
prompts could direct computational, robotic, or biological systems to desired
behaviors. This work provides a concrete step toward this vision of AI-biology
partnerships, in which language replaces mathematical objective functions,
fixed rules, and domain-specific programming.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models, while offering immense creative potential, are
highly reliant on human intervention, posing significant usability challenges
that often necessitate manual, iterative prompt engineering over often
underspecified prompts. This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving
image generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve
generated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial
prompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where
specialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify
weaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide
interpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent
while preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge
for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing
problematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with
user intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models
demonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial
prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with
more advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and
effective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation.

Conclusion: LLMs与认知架构的协同组合是处理复杂认知建模的重要方向

Abstract: Computational cognitive architectures are broadly scoped models of the human
mind that combine different psychological functionalities (as well as often
different computational methods for these different functionalities) into one
unified framework. They structure them in a psychologically plausible and
validated way. However, such models thus far have only limited computational
capabilities, mostly limited by the computational tools and techniques that
were adopted. More recently, LLMs have proved to be more capable
computationally than any other tools. Thus, in order to deal with both
real-world complexity and psychological realism at the same time, incorporating
LLMs into cognitive architectures naturally becomes an important task. In the
present article, a synergistic combination of the Clarion cognitive
architecture and LLMs is discussed as a case study. The implicit-explicit
dichotomy that is fundamental to Clarion is leveraged for a seamless
integration of Clarion and LLMs. As a result, computational power of LLMs is
combined with psychological nicety of Clarion.

biological systems. Moreover, to ensure consistency and reliability, we
incorporate a dynamic evidence reconciliation module that resolves semantic

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
solutions across various domains, from political science to software
development. However, these models are constrained by their training data,
which is static and limited to information available up to a specific date.
Additionally, their generalized nature often necessitates fine-tuning --
whether for classification or instructional purposes -- to effectively perform
specific downstream tasks. AI agents, leveraging LLMs as their core, mitigate
some of these limitations by accessing external tools and real-time data,
enabling applications such as live weather reporting and data analysis. In
industrial settings, AI agents are transforming operations by enhancing
decision-making, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. For example,
in manufacturing, AI agents enable near-autonomous systems that boost
productivity and support real-time decision-making. Despite these advancements,
AI agents remain vulnerable to security threats, including prompt injection
attacks, which pose significant risks to their integrity and reliability. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for integrating
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents, providing a robust security
guardrail. This framework aims to support the effective and scalable deployment
of AI agents, with a focus on on-premises implementations.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist

representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly
proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using
the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics,
including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power
constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results
identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action
tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory
footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance
degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter
GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant
accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and
optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges

Abstract: Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates
intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem
and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct
reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and
branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The
topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including
traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal
inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag
set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling,
tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment
regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each
topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along
with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and
deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey).
Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are
highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty,
grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and
treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning
structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against
computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely
depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop
testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and
long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from
narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only
analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable
evidence and credible outcomes.

process that dynamically identifies user via face and voice, and gathers
relevant context from a long-term memory; (ii) an omnimodal dialog process that
generates personalized audio responses based on the retrieved context; and
(iii) a memory management process that automatically detects dialog boundaries
from omnimodal streams, and extracts necessary information to update the
long-term memory. Unlike existing memory agents for LLMs, EgoMem relies
entirely on raw audiovisual streams, making it especially suitable for
lifelong, real-time, and embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
that EgoMem's retrieval and memory management modules achieve over 95% accuracy
on the test set. When integrated with a fine-tuned RoboEgo omnimodal chatbot,
the system achieves fact-consistency scores above 87% in real-time personalized

Conclusion: DECOR通过统一的框架有效解决了目标不一致问题，既保留了预训练语义又增强了令牌嵌入的适应性

Abstract: Recent advances in generative recommenders adopt a two-stage paradigm: items
are first tokenized into semantic IDs using a pretrained tokenizer, and then
large language models (LLMs) are trained to generate the next item via
sequence-to-sequence modeling. However, these two stages are optimized for
different objectives: semantic reconstruction during tokenizer pretraining
versus user interaction modeling during recommender training. This objective
misalignment leads to two key limitations: (i) suboptimal static tokenization,
where fixed token assignments fail to reflect diverse usage contexts; and (ii)
discarded pretrained semantics, where pretrained knowledge - typically from
language model embeddings - is overwritten during recommender training on user
interactions. To address these limitations, we propose to learn DEcomposed
COntextual Token Representations (DECOR), a unified framework that preserves
pretrained semantics while enhancing the adaptability of token embeddings.
DECOR introduces contextualized token composition to refine token embeddings
based on user interaction context, and decomposed embedding fusion that
integrates pretrained codebook embeddings with newly learned collaborative

TL;DR: 提出了GEO-16框架来评估AI搜索引擎引用网页的质量，通过16个质量指标对三个主流AI引擎的引用行为进行分析，发现页面质量是引用的强预测因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI搜索引擎通过生成回答并引用网页来源来中介领域知识获取，需要系统评估这些引擎引用网页的质量标准和偏好。

Method: 使用70个产品意图提示词，收集了1,702个引用（来自Brave Summary、Google AI Overviews和Perplexity），审计了1,100个唯一URL，采用逻辑模型和域聚类标准误差分析。

Result: 不同引擎在引用页面质量上存在差异，元数据和新鲜度、语义HTML、结构化数据等指标与引用关联最强。总体页面质量是引用的强预测因子，G≥0.70且至少12个支柱命中的阈值与显著更高的引用率相关。

Conclusion: 研究提供了实用的发布者指南，但这是观察性研究，专注于英语B2B SaaS页面，存在局限性和有效性威胁。

Abstract: AI answer engines increasingly mediate access to domain knowledge by
generating responses and citing web sources. We introduce GEO-16, a 16 pillar
auditing framework that converts on page quality signals into banded pillar
scores and a normalized GEO score G that ranges from 0 to 1. Using 70 product
intent prompts, we collected 1,702 citations across three engines (Brave
Summary, Google AI Overviews, and Perplexity) and audited 1,100 unique URLs. In
our corpus, the engines differed in the GEO quality of the pages they cited,
and pillars related to Metadata and Freshness, Semantic HTML, and Structured
Data showed the strongest associations with citation. Logistic models with
domain clustered standard errors indicate that overall page quality is a strong
predictor of citation, and simple operating points (for example, G at least
0.70 combined with at least 12 pillar hits) align with substantially higher
citation rates in our data. We report per engine contrasts, vertical effects,
threshold analysis, and diagnostics, then translate findings into a practical
playbook for publishers. The study is observational and focuses on English
language B2B SaaS pages; we discuss limitations, threats to validity, and
reproducibility considerations.

Conclusion: 基于原则的多智能体编排和持续质量控制为复杂计算环境中的通用桌面自动化提供了卓越的可靠性。

Abstract: Autonomous agents for desktop automation struggle with complex multi-step
tasks due to poor coordination and inadequate quality control. We introduce
\textsc{Agentic Lybic}, a novel multi-agent system where the entire
architecture operates as a finite-state machine (FSM). This core innovation
enables dynamic orchestration. Our system comprises four components: a
Controller, a Manager, three Workers (Technician for code-based operations,
Operator for GUI interactions, and Analyst for decision support), and an
Evaluator. The critical mechanism is the FSM-based routing between these
components, which provides flexibility and generalization by dynamically
selecting the optimal execution strategy for each subtask. This principled
orchestration, combined with robust quality gating, enables adaptive replanning
and error recovery. Evaluated officially on the OSWorld benchmark,
\textsc{Agentic Lybic} achieves a state-of-the-art 57.07\% success rate in 50
steps, substantially outperforming existing methods. Results demonstrate that
principled multi-agent orchestration with continuous quality control provides
superior reliability for generalized desktop automation in complex computing
environments.

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large

`Divide and Conquer' framework consisting of a visual question-answering task,
a domain knowledge assessment task, and a patient education counseling
assessment task. Our investigation revealed limitations of MLLMs' ability in
interpreting complex spinal radiographs and comprehending AIS care knowledge.
To address these, we pioneered enhancing MLLMs with spinal keypoint prompting
and compiled an AIS knowledge base for retrieval augmented generation (RAG),
respectively. Results showed varying effectiveness of visual prompting across
different architectures, while RAG substantially improved models' performances
on the knowledge assessment task. Our findings indicate current MLLMs are far

Conclusion: 监督对比学习可以有效地应用于模仿学习，通过学习更好的状态表示来改善智能体在游戏环境中的性能表现。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Supervised Contrastive Learning
(SupCon) to Imitation Learning (IL), with a focus on learning more effective
state representations for agents in video game environments. The goal is to
obtain latent representations of the observations that capture better the
action-relevant factors, thereby modeling better the cause-effect relationship
from the observations that are mapped to the actions performed by the
demonstrator, for example, the player jumps whenever an obstacle appears ahead.
We propose an approach to integrate the SupCon loss with continuous output
spaces, enabling SupCon to operate without constraints regarding the type of
actions of the environment. Experiments on the 3D games Astro Bot and Returnal,

Motivation: 解决不完全知识图谱上复杂查询回答中逻辑完备性与计算效率之间的根本性权衡问题。传统基于Grounding的方法存在组合爆炸问题，而大多数基于Skolem化的方法忽视了显式建模Skolem函数并损害了逻辑一致性。

Method: 提出Logic-constrained Vector Symbolic Architecture (LVSA)框架，包含：1）可微Skolem化模块 2）神经否定器 3）逻辑约束驱动的优化协议，用于协调几何和逻辑需求。

Result: 理论上保证对所有EFO₁查询的普遍性；实证上超越最先进的基于Skolem化的方法，相比基于Grounding的基线方法将推理成本降低了数量级。

Conclusion: LVSA框架成功解决了复杂查询回答中的逻辑完备性与效率权衡问题，为神经符号推理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Complex Query Answering (CQA) over incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs),
typically formalized as reasoning with Existential First-Order predicate logic
with one free variable (EFO$_1$), faces a fundamental trade-off between logical
soundness and computational efficiency. This work establishes the
Grounding-Skolemization dichotomy for systematically analyzing CQA methods
through the lens of formal logic. While Grounding-based methods inherently
suffer from combinatorial explosion, most Skolemization-based methods neglect
to explicitly model Skolem functions and compromise logical consistency. To
address these limitations, we propose the Logic-constrained Vector Symbolic
Architecture (LVSA), a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies a differentiable
Skolemization module and a neural negator, as well as a logical
constraint-driven optimization protocol to harmonize geometric and logical
requirements. Theoretically, LVSA guarantees universality for all EFO$_1$
queries. Empirically, it outperforms state-of-the-art Skolemization-based
methods and reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude compared to
Grounding-based baselines.

Result: NCA不仅能重现生物启发式目标模式，还能泛化到新条件，表现出对扰动的鲁棒性、开放式适应能力和推理能力，在机器人形态控制和ARC-AGI-1等推理任务中显示良好性能。

Conclusion: NCA构成了一个统一的计算精简范式，不仅连接了多尺度生物学与现代生成式AI的见解，还有潜力设计真正具有层次推理和控制能力的生物启发式集体智能。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) represent a powerful framework for modeling
biological self-organization, extending classical rule-based systems with
trainable, differentiable (or evolvable) update rules that capture the adaptive
self-regulatory dynamics of living matter. By embedding Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs) as local decision-making centers and interaction rules between
localized agents, NCA can simulate processes across molecular, cellular,
tissue, and system-level scales, offering a multiscale competency architecture
perspective on evolution, development, regeneration, aging, morphogenesis, and
robotic control. These models not only reproduce biologically inspired target
patterns but also generalize to novel conditions, demonstrating robustness to
perturbations and the capacity for open-ended adaptation and reasoning. Given
their immense success in recent developments, we here review current literature
of NCAs that are relevant primarily for biological or bioengineering
applications. Moreover, we emphasize that beyond biology, NCAs display robust
and generalizing goal-directed dynamics without centralized control, e.g., in
controlling or regenerating composite robotic morphologies or even on
cutting-edge reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI-1. In addition, the same
principles of iterative state-refinement is reminiscent to modern generative
Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as probabilistic diffusion models. Their
governing self-regulatory behavior is constraint to fully localized
interactions, yet their collective behavior scales into coordinated
system-level outcomes. We thus argue that NCAs constitute a unifying
computationally lean paradigm that not only bridges fundamental insights from
multiscale biology with modern generative AI, but have the potential to design
truly bio-inspired collective intelligence capable of hierarchical reasoning
and control.

Abstract: Automating the generation of scientific videos is a crucial yet challenging
task for effective knowledge dissemination. However, existing works on document
automation primarily focus on static media such as posters and slides, lacking
mechanisms for personalized dynamic orchestration and multimodal content
synchronization. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoAgent, a novel
multi-agent framework that synthesizes personalized scientific videos through a
conversational interface. VideoAgent parses a source paper into a fine-grained
asset library and, guided by user requirements, orchestrates a narrative flow
that synthesizes both static slides and dynamic animations to explain complex
concepts. To enable rigorous evaluation, we also propose SciVidEval, the first
comprehensive suite for this task, which combines automated metrics for
multimodal content quality and synchronization with a Video-Quiz-based human
evaluation to measure knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing commercial scientific video
generation services and approaches human-level quality in scientific
communication.

Abstract: Healthcare and medicine are multimodal disciplines that deal with multimodal
data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. Although some multimodal
reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific
domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall
short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of
multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare
professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through
a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in
accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the
reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the
best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at
different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and
disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning
framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to
further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and
analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed
preliminary approach.

Abstract: Translating software between programming languages is a challenging task, for
which automated techniques have been elusive and hard to scale up to larger
programs. A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to
re-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic
constructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away
from the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall
functionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic
approach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a
framework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level
structure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing
lower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to
the target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different
ways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in
conjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly,
skeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual
fragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically
translated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a
whole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of
skeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show
promising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python
programs, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code
fragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual
effort. All the final translations are correct with respect to whole-program
test suites.

Abstract: Stock recommendation is critical in Fintech applications, which use price
series and alternative information to estimate future stock performance.
Although deep learning models are prevalent in stock recommendation systems,
traditional time-series forecasting training often fails to capture stock
trends and rankings simultaneously, which are essential consideration factors
for investors. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL)
framework for stock recommendation, \textbf{M}omentum-\textbf{i}ntegrated
\textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{Stoc}k \textbf{R}ecommendation with Converge-based
Optimization (\textbf{MiM-StocR}). To improve the model's ability to capture
short-term trends, we novelly invoke a momentum line indicator in model
training. To prioritize top-performing stocks and optimize investment
allocation, we propose a list-wise ranking loss function called Adaptive-k
ApproxNDCG. Moreover, due to the volatility and uncertainty of the stock
market, existing MTL frameworks face overfitting issues when applied to stock
time series. To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Converge-based
Quad-Balancing (CQB) method. We conducted extensive experiments on three stock
benchmarks: SEE50, CSI 100, and CSI 300. MiM-StocR outperforms state-of-the-art
MTL baselines across both ranking and profitable evaluations.

Conclusion: AlignKT通过显式建模和对齐知识状态，有效提升了知识追踪的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) serves as a fundamental component of Intelligent
Tutoring Systems (ITS), enabling these systems to monitor and understand
learners' progress by modeling their knowledge state. However, many existing KT
models primarily focus on fitting the sequences of learners' interactions, and
often overlook the knowledge state itself. This limitation leads to reduced
interpretability and insufficient instructional support from the ITS. To
address this challenge, we propose AlignKT, which employs a frontend-to-backend
architecture to explicitly model a stable knowledge state. In this approach,
the preliminary knowledge state is aligned with an additional criterion.
Specifically, we define an ideal knowledge state based on pedagogical theories
as the alignment criterion, providing a foundation for interpretability. We
utilize five encoders to implement this set-up, and incorporate a contrastive
learning module to enhance the robustness of the alignment process. Through
extensive experiments, AlignKT demonstrates superior performance, outperforming
seven KT baselines on three real-world datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art
results on two of these datasets and exhibits competitive performance on the
third. The code of this work is available at

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for AI-based building energy

across various control problems in building energy management. To address this
gap, we propose BuildingGym, an open-source tool designed as a
research-friendly and flexible framework for training RL control strategies for
common challenges in building energy management. BuildingGym integrates
EnergyPlus as its core simulator, making it suitable for both system-level and
room-level control. Additionally, BuildingGym is able to accept external
signals as control inputs instead of taking the building as a stand-alone
entity. This feature makes BuildingGym applicable for more flexible
environments, e.g. smart grid and EVs community. The tool provides several
built-in RL algorithms for control strategy training, simplifying the process
for building managers to obtain optimal control strategies. Users can achieve
this by following a few straightforward steps to configure BuildingGym for
optimization control for common problems in the building energy management
field. Moreover, AI specialists can easily implement and test state-of-the-art
control algorithms within the platform. BuildingGym bridges the gap between
building managers and AI specialists by allowing for the easy configuration and
replacement of RL algorithms, simulators, and control environments or problems.
With BuildingGym, we efficiently set up training tasks for cooling load
management, targeting both constant and dynamic cooling load management. The
built-in algorithms demonstrated strong performance across both tasks,
highlighting the effectiveness of BuildingGym in optimizing cooling strategies.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the remarkable efficiency,
flexibility, and adaptability of the human brain in artificial systems. Unlike
conventional digital approaches, which depend on massive computational and
energy resources, neuromorphic systems exploit brain-inspired principles of
computation to achieve orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency. By
drawing on insights from artificial intelligence, neuroscience, physics,
chemistry, and materials science, neuromorphic computing promises to deliver
intelligent systems that are sustainable, transparent, and widely accessible. A
central challenge, however, is to identify a unifying theoretical framework
capable of bridging these diverse disciplines. We argue that dynamical systems
theory provides such a foundation. Rooted in differential calculus, it offers a
principled language for modeling inference, learning, and control in both
natural and artificial substrates. Within this framework, noise can be
harnessed as a resource for learning, while differential genetic programming
enables the discovery of dynamical systems that implement adaptive behaviors.
Embracing this perspective paves the way toward emergent neuromorphic
intelligence, where intelligent behavior arises from the dynamics of physical
substrates, advancing both the science and sustainability of AI.

Motivation: 传统传感器选择方法依赖线性化可观测性指标或统计相关性，无法捕捉复杂系统的时序演化特性，需要新的动态因果分析方法

Conclusion: 该框架基于动态因果关系而非静态相关性进行传感器选择，提高了可解释性，在过程工程、生态监测和农业领域有重要应用价值

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for optimizing observer-based soft
sensors through dynamic causality analysis. Traditional approaches to sensor
selection often rely on linearized observability indices or statistical
correlations that fail to capture the temporal evolution of complex systems. We
address this gap by leveraging liquid-time constant (LTC) networks,
continuous-time neural architectures with input-dependent time constants, to
systematically identify and prune sensor inputs with minimal causal influence
on state estimation. Our methodology implements an iterative workflow: training
an LTC observer on candidate inputs, quantifying each input's causal impact
through controlled perturbation analysis, removing inputs with negligible
effect, and retraining until performance degradation occurs. We demonstrate
this approach on three mechanistic testbeds representing distinct physical
domains: a harmonically forced spring-mass-damper system, a nonlinear
continuous stirred-tank reactor, and a predator-prey model following the
structure of the Lotka-Volterra model, but with seasonal forcing and added
complexity. Results show that our causality-guided pruning consistently
identifies minimal sensor sets that align with underlying physics while
improving prediction accuracy. The framework automatically distinguishes
essential physical measurements from noise and determines when derived
interaction terms provide complementary versus redundant information. Beyond
computational efficiency, this approach enhances interpretability by grounding
sensor selection decisions in dynamic causal relationships rather than static
correlations, offering significant benefits for soft sensing applications
across process engineering, ecological monitoring, and agricultural domains.

Conclusion: 模块化设计提高了预测准确性和可解释性，同时开发了交互式可视化工具支持气候敏感部门的决策制定

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is indispensable in agriculture, disaster
management, and sustainable strategies. However, predicting rainfall has been
challenging due to the complexity of climate systems and the heterogeneous
nature of multi-source observational data, including radar, satellite imagery,
and surface-level measurements. The multi-source data vary in spatial and
temporal resolution, and they carry domain-specific features, making it
challenging for effective integration in conventional deep learning models.
Previous research has explored various machine learning techniques for weather
prediction; however, most struggle with the integration of data with
heterogeneous modalities. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive
Mixture of Experts (MoE) model tailored for precipitation rate prediction. Each
expert within the model specializes in a specific modality or spatio-temporal
pattern. We also incorporated a dynamic router that learns to assign inputs to
the most relevant experts. Our results show that this modular design enhances
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In addition to the modeling
framework, we introduced an interactive web-based visualization tool that
enables users to intuitively explore historical weather patterns over time and
space. The tool was designed to support decision-making for stakeholders in
climate-sensitive sectors. We evaluated our approach using a curated multimodal
climate dataset capturing real-world conditions during Hurricane Ian in 2022.
The benchmark results show that the Adaptive MoE significantly outperformed all
the baselines.

Abstract: Machine learning has been extensively used in various applications related to
eye-tracking research. Understanding eye movement is one of the most
significant subsets of eye-tracking research that reveals the scanning pattern
of an individual. Researchers have thoroughly analyzed eye movement data to
understand various eye-tracking applications, such as attention mechanisms,
navigational behavior, task understanding, etc. The outcome of traditional
machine learning algorithms used for decoding tasks based on eye movement data
has received a mixed reaction to Yarbus' claim that it is possible to decode
the observer's task from their eye movements. In this paper, to support the
hypothesis by Yarbus, we are decoding tasks categories while generating
synthetic data samples using well-known Synthetic Data Generators CTGAN and its
variations such as CopulaGAN and Gretel AI Synthetic Data generators on
available data from an in-person user study. Our results show that augmenting
more eye movement data combined with additional synthetically generated

algorithms. We see a significant improvement in task decoding accuracy from
28.1% using Random Forest to 82% using Inception Time when five times more data
is added in addition to the 320 real eye movement dataset sample. Our proposed
framework outperforms all the available studies on this dataset because of the
use of additional synthetic datasets. We validated our claim with various
algorithms and combinations of real and synthetic data to show how decoding
accuracy increases with the increase in the augmentation of generated data to
real data.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction in autonomous driving requires a
comprehensive understanding of complex social dynamics. Existing methods,
however, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics,
particularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse
behaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling
heterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global
context, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each
agent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and
complex group-wise interactions (\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or
pedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of
agent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme
and type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced,
type-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a
principled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and
expressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
HeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for
key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE. Our work demonstrates that a
locality-grounded architecture, which explicitly models multi-scale and
heterogeneous interactions, is a highly effective strategy for advancing motion
forecasting.

Abstract: Engineering models created in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
environments contain detailed information about system structure and behavior.
However, they typically lack symbolic planning semantics such as preconditions,
effects, and constraints related to resource availability and timing. This
limits their ability to evaluate whether a given system variant can fulfill
specific tasks and how efficiently it performs compared to alternatives.
  To address this gap, this paper presents a model-driven method that enables
the specification and automated generation of symbolic planning artifacts
within SysML-based engineering models. A dedicated SysML profile introduces
reusable stereotypes for core planning constructs. These are integrated into
existing model structures and processed by an algorithm that generates a valid
domain file and a corresponding problem file in Planning Domain Definition
Language (PDDL). In contrast to previous approaches that rely on manual
transformations or external capability models, the method supports native
integration and maintains consistency between engineering and planning
artifacts.
  The applicability of the method is demonstrated through a case study from
aircraft assembly. The example illustrates how existing engineering models are
enriched with planning semantics and how the proposed workflow is applied to
generate consistent planning artifacts from these models. The generated
planning artifacts enable the validation of system variants through AI
planning.

Abstract: The concept of the 'agent' has profoundly shaped Artificial Intelligence (AI)
research, guiding development from foundational theories to contemporary
applications like Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems. This paper
critically re-evaluates the necessity and optimality of this agent-centric
paradigm. We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent
anthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish
between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g.,
LLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems,
currently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the
impression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant
literature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks,
highlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and
goal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems,
while heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying
computational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an
alternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in
system-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence. We conclude
that investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks, inspired by complex
systems, biology, and unconventional computing, is essential for advancing
towards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general
intelligence. This requires not only new architectures but also a fundamental
reconsideration of our understanding of intelligence itself, moving beyond the
agent metaphor.

Abstract: The stability of recursively trained large language models (LLMs) is a
foundational problem for AI safety. Prevailing theory predicts model collapse,
a progressive degradation when models are trained on their own output. We
challenge this narrative by introducing a selective feedback mechanism.
Contrary to expectation, instead of merely slowing decay, our experiments
provide strong evidence that this pressure reverses it, inducing a
statistically significant performance improvement in a Gemma 2B model on a
complex summarization task. We name this phenomenon the Anti-Ouroboros Effect.
We contrast this with a foundational experiment using a simple classifier,
where the theoretical degenerative loop was validated, highlighting the unique
dynamics of high-dimensional models. Our findings establish that systemic
resilience can be an emergent property of LLMs under simple selection pressure,
suggesting a powerful and scalable principle for developing safer and more
robust AI systems. Across five generations, a quality-filtered condition
improved by 6.6% in ROUGE-L F1 score, whereas an unfiltered control degraded by
3.5% and a random-filter control degraded by 4.2%

Conclusion: MoCE方法通过聚类专家和双阶段路由成功解决了MoE架构的专家专业化挑战，为大规模语言模型的高效扩展提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: A sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a highly
scalable solution by conditionally activating sub-modules without a
proportional increase in computational costs. However, improving expert
specialization to enhance performance and generalization remains a challenge
for MoE, especially in instruction tuning scenarios characterized by
significant input heterogeneity. In this work, we propose the
Mixture-of-Clustered-Experts (MoCE) to address this limitation through a
dual-stage routing mechanism. The first stage in the mechanism performs expert
group routing based on sequence-level features, while the second stage
activates the top-$k$ experts within the group at the token level. This
approach enables the effective partitioning of heterogeneous inputs based on
their knowledge requirements, encouraging expert group specialization while
maintaining the advantages of token-level routing. We evaluate MoCE across a
comprehensive set of benchmarks, demonstrating its consistent superiority over
strong baselines and its enhanced generalization capabilities. Detailed
analysis further highlights the robustness and effectiveness of MoCE.

Abstract: Offline preference optimization methods are efficient for large language
models (LLMs) alignment. Direct Preference optimization (DPO)-like learning,
one of the most popular approaches, stands out for its efficiency in reward
modeling. However, these methods typically follow the convention to use
Bradley-Terry (BT) reward modeling that faces several critical assumptions,
including the requirement for pairwise training data, model distribution
shifting, human rationality assumption, etc. To address these limitations, we
propose a general framework for offline preference optimization methods,
Adaptive Preference Optimization with Utility Anchor (UAPO), which introduces
an anchoring function to estimate the uncertainties brought from preference
data annotation. Our method enables training even in scenarios where the data
is unpaired, significantly enhancing data utilization efficiency. Moreover, the
anchor design makes UAPO more robust in the training process. Experimental
results demonstrate that UAPO achieves competitive outcomes without the strict
dependency on data pairing, paving the way for more flexible and effective

Conclusion: HKM为公共大型语言模型提供了范式转变，支持无需重新训练的持续适应，未来可扩展到多模态融合和量子硬件，有望将微调成本降低60-80%。

Abstract: We introduce the Holographic Knowledge Manifold (HKM), a four-phase pipeline
that achieves zero catastrophic forgetting in AI knowledge representation while
maintaining minimal memory growth and high efficiency. Leveraging fractal
quantization, probabilistic entanglement, and dynamic diffraction chipping, HKM
compresses knowledge substrates by 3x with 67% storage savings, integrates
holographically at 100%, and supports over 1,020 updates with 1% growth per
increment. In experiments on combined WikiText and FB15k datasets (scaled to
2,997 nodes), we demonstrate industry-leading performance: 0% forgetting
(infinite improvement over GEM baselines), 3x compression, and 53% training
time reduction on consumer GPU hardware. Hypothetical cost analyses project
$92.4M savings over 5 years at petabyte scale, with 21.2% energy reduction and
33% lower carbon footprint. This work hypothesizes a paradigm shift for public
large language models (LLMs), enabling "eternal" adaptation without retraining.
Future extensions to multimodal fusion and quantum hardware could further
democratize scalable AI, potentially reducing fine-tuning costs by 60-80% for
models like Llama-3 or Grok-4. Code, datasets, and full results are publicly
available for reproducibility.

Motivation: 现有基于MoE架构的Transformer模型在计算效率和长距离依赖捕获方面仍有不足，特别是在专家资源分配的动态适应性方面存在缺陷。

Method: 1) 使用分组多头注意力(GMHA)降低长序列计算复杂度；2) 设计双尺度共享专家结构(DSSE)，浅层专家处理低维特征，深层专家处理高维语义；3) 提出分层自适应动态路由(ADR)机制，根据特征复杂度动态选择专家级别。

Result: 在多个长序列基准数据集上的实验表明，DASG-MoE模型优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: 该模型通过三个模块的有效整合，在长序列建模中实现了效率与精度的动态平衡，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Transformer models based on the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture have
made significant progress in long-sequence modeling, but existing models still
have shortcomings in computational efficiency and the ability to capture
long-range dependencies, especially in terms of the dynamic adaptability of
expert resource allocation. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive Shared
Expert and Grouped Multi-Head Attention Hybrid Model (DASG-MoE) to enhance
long-sequence modeling capabilities by integrating three modules. First, we
employ the Grouped Multi-Head Attention (GMHA) mechanism to effectively reduce
the computational complexity of long sequences. By parallel processing through
sequence grouping, local sliding window attention, and feature aggregation, we
address long-range dependency issues and the model's lack of generalization for
local information. Second, we design a Dual-Scale Shared Expert Structure
(DSSE), where shallow experts use lightweight computations to quickly respond
to low-dimensional features, while deep experts process high-dimensional
complex semantics through pre-training transfer and post-training optimization,
achieving a dynamic balance between efficiency and accuracy. Third, we propose
a hierarchical Adaptive Dynamic Routing (ADR) mechanism that dynamically
selects expert levels based on feature complexity and task requirements, and
optimizes resource allocation through a local expert activation strategy.
Experiments on multiple long-sequence benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
DASG-MoE model outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Method: 提出Polar Coordinate Position Embeddings (PoPE)方法，消除内容和位置信息的混淆，通过极坐标方式分离what和where信息

Result: PoPE在诊断任务上显著优于RoPE，在音乐、基因组和自然语言的自回归建模中表现更好，在124M到774M参数规模的语言模型上都保持优势，并展现出强大的零样本长度外推能力

Conclusion: PoPE是一种有效的RoPE改进方案，能够解决位置编码中的内容-位置纠缠问题，提升模型性能和外推能力

Abstract: The attention mechanism in a Transformer architecture matches key to query
based on both content -- the what -- and position in a sequence -- the where.
We present an analysis indicating that what and where are entangled in the
popular RoPE rotary position embedding. This entanglement can impair
performance particularly when decisions require independent matches on these
two factors. We propose an improvement to RoPE, which we call Polar Coordinate
Position Embeddings or PoPE, that eliminates the what-where confound. PoPE is
far superior on a diagnostic task requiring indexing solely by position or by
content. On autoregressive sequence modeling in music, genomic, and natural
language domains, Transformers using PoPE as the positional encoding scheme
outperform baselines using RoPE with respect to evaluation loss (perplexity)
and downstream task performance. On language modeling, these gains persist
across model scale, from 124M to 774M parameters. Crucially, PoPE shows strong
zero-shot length extrapolation capabilities, whereas RoPE's performance
degrades significantly on longer sequences at test time without fine tuning or
the use of position-interpolation methods.

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病案例中，DualAlign生成的情境化症状级句子更好地反映真实临床文档。结合人工标注数据的微调模型相比仅使用黄金数据或非指导合成基线的模型获得显著性能提升

Conclusion: 虽然DualAlign未能完全捕捉纵向复杂性，但为生成临床基础、隐私保护的合成数据支持低资源临床文本分析提供了实用方法

Abstract: Synthetic clinical data are increasingly important for advancing AI in
healthcare, given strict privacy constraints on real-world EHRs, limited
availability of annotated rare-condition data, and systemic biases in
observational datasets. While large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent
clinical text, producing synthetic data that is both realistic and clinically
meaningful remains challenging. We introduce DualAlign, a framework that
enhances statistical fidelity and clinical plausibility through dual alignment:
(1) statistical alignment, which conditions generation on patient demographics
and risk factors; and (2) semantic alignment, which incorporates real-world
symptom trajectories to guide content generation. Using Alzheimer's disease
(AD) as a case study, DualAlign produces context-grounded symptom-level
sentences that better reflect real-world clinical documentation. Fine-tuning an
LLaMA 3.1-8B model with a combination of DualAlign-generated and
human-annotated data yields substantial performance gains over models trained
on gold data alone or unguided synthetic baselines. While DualAlign does not
fully capture longitudinal complexity, it offers a practical approach for
generating clinically grounded, privacy-preserving synthetic data to support
low-resource clinical text analysis.

Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生不准确或不可靠的内容（幻觉），这限制了其在高风险应用中的部署，因此需要一种通用的幻觉检测方法。

Conclusion: 通过物理视角建模LLM行为，HalluField提供了一种原理性的幻觉检测方法，具有优异的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning and
question-answering capabilities. However, they often produce inaccurate or
unreliable content known as hallucinations. This unreliability significantly
limits their deployment in high-stakes applications. Thus, there is a growing
need for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this
work, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for
hallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and
thermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM's response
to a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood
token paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By
analyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under
changes in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic
stability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying
unstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is
computationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the
model's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural
networks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical
interpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics.
Remarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField
achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and
datasets.

Abstract: Transformers have become the foundation for a wide range of

injecting diverse classes of faults--such as weight corruption, activation

Conclusion: 通过针对去噪扩散模型噪声估计问题的对抗性训练方法，有效解决了协变量偏移问题，提升了随机平滑方法的鲁棒性性能。

Abstract: Randomized smoothing is a well-established method for achieving certified
robustness against l2-adversarial perturbations. By incorporating a denoiser
before the base classifier, pretrained classifiers can be seamlessly integrated
into randomized smoothing without significant performance degradation. Among
existing methods, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing - where a pretrained denoising
diffusion model serves as the denoiser - has produced state-of-the-art results.
However, we show that employing a denoising diffusion model introduces a
covariate shift via misestimation of the added noise, ultimately degrading the
smoothed classifier's performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel
adversarial objective function focused on the added noise of the denoising
diffusion model. This approach is inspired by our understanding of the origin
of the covariate shift. Our goal is to train the base classifier to ensure it
is robust against the covariate shift introduced by the denoiser. Our method
significantly improves certified accuracy across three standard classification
benchmarks - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet - achieving new state-of-the-art
performance in l2-adversarial perturbations. Our implementation is publicly

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has transformed sequential decision-making, but
traditional algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) often struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and
adaptability in dynamic environments. This study presents LogGuardQ (Adaptive

LogGuardQ achieves a 96.0% detection rate (versus 93.0% for DQN and 47.1% for
PPO), with precision of 0.4776, recall of 0.9996, and an F1-score of 0.6450.
The mean reward is 20.34 \pm 44.63 across all episodes (versus 18.80 \pm 43.98

significant performance advantages (e.g., p = 0.0002 vs. DQN with negligible
effect size, p < 0.0001 vs. PPO with medium effect size, and p < 0.0001 for DQN
vs. PPO with small effect size). By bridging cognitive science and RL,
LogGuardQ offers a scalable approach to adaptive learning in uncertain

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated strong generalization
capabilities across a variety of tasks for efficiently fine-tuning AI models,
especially on resource-constrained edges. However, in real-world applications,
edge users often exhibit task-specific preferences that are difficult to handle
with a unified model trained under a closed-world assumption, and the challenge
may further increase when there are significant domain shifts between training
and deployment. Meanwhile, retraining/fine-tuning models for each user is also
impractical due to its cost-intensive nature and privacy concerns over raw data
utilization from edges. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-guided
LoRA Parameter Generation (SG-LoRA), the first of its kind framework to
efficiently produce user-specific LoRA parameters without any additional
training on user tasks or access to user-specific data. Concretely, SG-LoRA
uses task descriptions as the semantic bridge, measuring their proximity to a
set of known expert tasks in a shared embedding space. Based on this semantic
guidance, it models the target task's LoRA parameter distribution to generate
high-performing parameters for novel tasks. SG-LoRA enables the real-time
construction of LoRA models aligned with individual intents by distilling
knowledge from prominent LoRA experts and, meanwhile, offering a
privacy-preserving solution for personalized model adaptation in a novel
zero-shot open-world setting proposed in this work. Extensive experiments on
multiple challenging tasks confirm the superior performance and remarkable
adaptability of SG-LoRA. Code is available at

Conclusion: 测试时预热方法能有效增强MLLMs在不同推理任务上的鲁棒性，证明了在推理前进行'预热'的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced
reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully
realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder,
and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text
embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with
billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only
thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on
complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on
extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup
method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly
supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative
performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on
the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up'

Abstract: For groups of autonomous agents to achieve a particular goal, they must
engage in coordination and long-horizon reasoning. However, designing reward
functions to elicit such behavior is challenging. In this paper, we study how
self-supervised goal-reaching techniques can be leveraged to enable agents to
cooperate. The key idea is that, rather than have agents maximize some scalar
reward, agents aim to maximize the likelihood of visiting a certain goal. This
problem setting enables human users to specify tasks via a single goal state
rather than implementing a complex reward function. While the feedback signal
is quite sparse, we will demonstrate that self-supervised goal-reaching
techniques enable agents to learn from such feedback. On MARL benchmarks, our
proposed method outperforms alternative approaches that have access to the same
sparse reward signal as our method. While our method has no explicit mechanism
for exploration, we observe that self-supervised multi-agent goal-reaching
leads to emergent cooperation and exploration in settings where alternative
approaches never witness a single successful trial.

Conclusion: 提出的贝叶斯框架为顺序微调提供了有效的解决方案，能够处理分布漂移和资源受限场景

Abstract: Sequential fine-tuning of transformers is useful when new data arrive
sequentially, especially with shifting distributions. Unlike batch learning,
sequential learning demands that training be stabilized despite a small amount
of data by balancing new information and previously learned knowledge in the
pre-trained models. This challenge is further complicated when training is to
be completed in latency-critical environments and learning must additionally
quantify and be mediated by uncertainty. Motivated by these challenges, we
propose a novel method that frames sequential fine-tuning as a posterior
inference problem within a Bayesian framework. Our approach integrates
closed-form moment propagation of random variables, Kalman Bayesian Neural
Networks, and Taylor approximations of the moments of softmax functions. By
explicitly accounting for pre-trained models as priors and adaptively balancing
them against new information based on quantified uncertainty, our method
achieves robust and data-efficient sequential learning. The effectiveness of
our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations involving sequential
adaptation of a decision transformer to tasks characterized by distribution
shifts and limited memory resources.

Evaluated LLMs achieved 12-class zero- and one-shot classification F1-scores

classification via LLM-based fusion from modality-specific models can enable
multimodal temporal applications where there is limited aligned training data

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven valuable due to their ability to
provide interpretable and steerable representations. Current debiasing methods
based on SAEs manipulate these sparse activations presuming that feature
representations are housed within decoder weights. We challenge this
fundamental assumption and introduce an encoder-focused alternative for
representation debiasing, contributing three key findings: (i) we highlight an
unconventional SAE feature selection strategy, (ii) we propose a novel SAE
debiasing methodology that orthogonalizes input embeddings against encoder
weights, and (iii) we establish a performance-preserving mechanism during
debiasing through encoder weight interpolation. Our Selection and Projection
framework, termed S\&P TopK, surpasses conventional SAE usage in fairness
metrics by a factor of up to 3.2 and advances state-of-the-art test-time VLM
debiasing results by a factor of up to 1.8 while maintaining downstream
performance.

TL;DR: FACTORS是一个结合实验设计和Shapley分解的框架，用于解决对训练因素组合敏感的性能和稳定性问题，通过风险调整目标函数在固定预算下可靠选择配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练涉及众多因素组合，传统方法难以有效处理因素间的交互效应和预算约束下的配置选择问题。

Method: 采用实验设计与Shapley分解相结合的方法，通过两条互补路径（基于条件均值的插件路径和基于最小二乘的路径）估计主效应和双因素交互效应，并整合到风险调整目标函数中。

Result: 在多样化数据集和设计条件下，该方法提高了排名保持和最优配置识别能力，降低了决策风险，在预算约束下提供可解释的稳定性能提升。

Conclusion: FACTORS框架为大规模因素空间的配置调优提供了理论基础和实践工具，能够同时处理不确定性、成本和性能优化问题。

Abstract: We propose FACTORS, a framework that combines design of experiments with
Shapley decomposition to address performance and stability issues that are
sensitive to combinations of training factors. Our approach consistently
estimates main effects and two-factor interactions, then integrates them into a
risk-adjusted objective function that jointly accounts for uncertainty and
cost, enabling reliable selection of configurations under a fixed budget.
Effect estimation is implemented through two complementary paths: a plug-in
path based on conditional means, and a least-squares path that reconstructs
Shapley contributions from samples. These paths are designed to work
complementarily even when design density and bias levels differ. By
incorporating standardization of estimates, bias correction, and uncertainty
quantification, our procedure ensures comparability across heterogeneous factor
spaces and designs, while a lightweight search routine yields configurations
within practical time even for large factor spaces. On the theoretical side, we
provide error decompositions, sample complexity analysis, and upper bounds on
optimality gaps. On the interpretive side, we summarize main effects and
interactions in map form, highlighting adjustment priorities and safe
improvement pathways. Across diverse datasets and design conditions, our
approach improves rank preservation and optimal configuration identification,
reduces decision-making risks, and offers a tuning foundation that delivers
interpretable justification alongside stable performance gains even under
budget constraints.

Conclusion: Latent Replay为生成式AI模型实现了高效的持续学习，为能够随用户需求演化而不产生过高计算成本的个性化文本到图像模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Continual learning -- the ability to acquire knowledge incrementally without
forgetting previous skills -- is fundamental to natural intelligence. While the
human brain excels at this, artificial neural networks struggle with
"catastrophic forgetting," where learning new tasks erases previously acquired
knowledge. This challenge is particularly severe for text-to-image diffusion
models, which generate images from textual prompts. Additionally, these models
face "mode collapse," where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over
time. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a
neuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods
mitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically
requiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only
compact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal
architecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity
patterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving
critical information. Through experiments with five sequentially learned visual
concepts, we demonstrate that Latent Replay significantly outperforms existing
methods in maintaining model versatility. After learning all concepts, our
approach retained 77.59% Image Alignment (IA) on the earliest concept, 14%
higher than baseline methods, while maintaining diverse outputs. Surprisingly,
random selection of stored latent examples outperforms similarity-based
strategies. Our findings suggest that Latent Replay enables efficient continual
learning for generative AI models, paving the way for personalized
text-to-image models that evolve with user needs without excessive
computational costs.

Abstract: Predicting the success of start-up companies, defined as achieving an exit
through acquisition or IPO, is a critical problem in entrepreneurship and
innovation research. Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured
information (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and
unstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this
heterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine
learning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate
accuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but
struggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data. We present
\textbf{CrunchLLM}, a domain-adapted LLM framework for startup success
prediction. CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with
unstructured textual narratives and applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning
strategies alongside prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for
entrepreneurship data. Our approach achieves accuracy exceeding 80\% on
Crunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional
classifiers and baseline LLMs. Beyond predictive performance, CrunchLLM
provides interpretable reasoning traces that justify its predictions, enhancing
transparency and trustworthiness for financial and policy decision makers. This
work demonstrates how adapting LLMs with domain-aware fine-tuning and
structured--unstructured data fusion can advance predictive modeling of
entrepreneurial outcomes. CrunchLLM contributes a methodological framework and
a practical tool for data-driven decision making in venture capital and
innovation policy.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to neural network pruning by integrating
a graph-based observation space into an AutoML framework to address the
limitations of existing methods. Traditional pruning approaches often depend on
hand-crafted heuristics and local optimization perspectives, which can lead to
suboptimal performance and inefficient pruning strategies. Our framework
transforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the
target neural network that captures complete topological relationships between
layers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a
global view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph
Attention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph
representation and generates a rich embedding. Additionally, for the action
space we transition from continuous pruning ratios to fine-grained binary
action spaces which enables the agent to learn optimal channel importance
criteria directly from data, moving away from predefined scoring functions.
These contributions are modelled within a Constrained Markov Decision Process
(CMDP) framework, allowing the agent to make informed pruning decisions while
adhering to resource constraints such as target compression rates. For this, we
design a self-competition reward system that encourages the agent to outperform
its previous best performance while satisfying the defined constraints. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The experiments
show that our method consistently outperforms traditional pruning techniques,
showing state-of-the-art results while learning task-specific pruning
strategies that identify functionally redundant connections beyond simple
weight magnitude considerations.

predicting reward, it learns to recognize which action led to a successful

Abstract: Describing the world behavior through mathematical functions help scientists
to achieve a better understanding of the inner mechanisms of different
phenomena. Traditionally, this is done by deriving new equations from first
principles and careful observations. A modern alternative is to automate part
of this process with symbolic regression (SR). The SR algorithms search for a
function that adequately fits the observed data while trying to enforce
sparsity, in the hopes of generating an interpretable equation. A particularly
interesting extension to these algorithms is the Multi-view Symbolic Regression
(MvSR). It searches for a parametric function capable of describing multiple
datasets generated by the same phenomena, which helps to mitigate the common
problems of overfitting and data scarcity. Recently, multiple implementations
added support to MvSR with small differences between them. In this paper, we
test and compare MvSR as supported in Operon, PySR, phy-SO, and eggp, in
different real-world datasets. We show that they all often achieve good
accuracy while proposing solutions with only few free parameters. However, we
find that certain features enable a more frequent generation of better models.
We conclude by providing guidelines for future MvSR developments.

Conclusion: 该工作为计算逆合成规划提供了重要进展，证明了最差路径优化框架的有效性和实用性

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning aims to decompose target molecules into available
building blocks, forming a synthesis tree where each internal node represents
an intermediate compound and each leaf ideally corresponds to a purchasable
reactant. However, this tree becomes invalid if any leaf node is not a valid
building block, making the planning process vulnerable to the "weakest link" in
the synthetic route. Existing methods often optimise for average performance
across branches, failing to account for this worst-case sensitivity. In this
paper, we reframe retrosynthesis as a worst-path optimisation problem within
tree-structured Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that this
formulation admits a unique optimal solution and offers monotonic improvement
guarantees. Building on this insight, we introduce Interactive Retrosynthesis
Planning (InterRetro), a method that interacts with the tree MDP, learns a
value function for worst-path outcomes, and improves its policy through
self-imitation, preferentially reinforcing past decisions with high estimated
advantage. Empirically, InterRetro achieves state-of-the-art results, solving
100% of targets on the Retro*-190 benchmark, shortening synthetic routes by
4.9%, and achieving promising performance using only 10% of the training data -
representing a significant advance in computational retrosynthesis planning.

Abstract: Forecasting product demand in retail supply chains presents a complex
challenge due to noisy, heterogeneous features and rapidly shifting consumer
behavior. While traditional gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) offer
strong predictive performance on structured data, they often lack adaptive
mechanisms to identify and emphasize the most relevant features under changing
conditions. In this work, we propose AttnBoost, an interpretable learning
framework that integrates feature-level attention into the boosting process to
enhance both predictive accuracy and explainability. Specifically, the model
dynamically adjusts feature importance during each boosting round via a
lightweight attention mechanism, allowing it to focus on high-impact variables
such as promotions, pricing, and seasonal trends. We evaluate AttnBoost on a
large-scale retail sales dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms standard
machine learning and deep tabular models, while also providing actionable
insights for supply chain managers. An ablation study confirms the utility of
the attention module in mitigating overfitting and improving interpretability.
Our results suggest that attention-guided boosting represents a promising
direction for interpretable and scalable AI in real-world forecasting
applications.

Abstract: Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a novel framework for
distributed model training. In FL, the task publisher (TP) releases tasks, and
local model owners (LMOs) use their local data to train models. Sometimes, FL
suffers from the lack of training data, and thus workers are recruited for
gathering data. To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive incentive
mechanism from a service-oriented perspective, with the objective of maximizing
the utilities of TP, LMOs and workers. Specifically, a Stackelberg game is
theoretically established between the LMOs and TP, positioning TP as the leader
and the LMOs as followers. An analytical Nash equilibrium solution is derived
to maximize their utilities. The interaction between LMOs and workers is
formulated by a multi-agent Markov decision process (MAMDP), with the optimal
strategy identified via deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Additionally, an
Adaptively Searching the Optimal Strategy Algorithm (ASOSA) is designed to
stabilize the strategies of each participant and solve the coupling problems.
Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Continuous attractors are critical for information processing in both
biological and artificial neural systems, with implications for spatial
navigation, memory, and deep learning optimization. However, existing research
lacks a unified framework to analyze their properties across diverse dynamical

continuous attractors in artificial neural networks. It verifies compatibility

of singular value stratification in common classification models and datasets.
These findings suggest continuous attractors may be ubiquitous in general
neural networks, highlighting the need for a general theory, with the proposed

Motivation: 医疗数据隐私约束和统计异质性限制了机器学习模型在院内死亡率预测中的应用，需要研究联邦学习在非IID和不平衡条件下的性能。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据集，按临床护理单元划分模拟非IID环境，应用SMOTE-Tomek技术处理类别不平衡，比较FedAvg、FedProx、FedAdagrad、FedAdam和FedCluster五种联邦学习策略。

Result: FedProx在50轮通信中表现最稳定且性能最佳（F1=0.8831），FedAvg计算效率最高但预测性能较差。

Abstract: Machine learning models hold significant potential for predicting in-hospital
mortality, yet data privacy constraints and the statistical heterogeneity of
real-world clinical data often hamper their development. Federated Learning
(FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but its performance under
non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) and imbalanced conditions
requires rigorous investigation. The study presents a comparative benchmark of
five federated learning strategies: FedAvg, FedProx, FedAdagrad, FedAdam, and
FedCluster for mortality prediction. Using the large-scale MIMIC-IV dataset, we
simulate a realistic non-IID environment by partitioning data by clinical care
unit. To address the inherent class imbalance of the task, the SMOTE-Tomek
technique is applied to each client's local training data. Our experiments,
conducted over 50 communication rounds, reveal that the regularization-based
strategy, FedProx, consistently outperformed other methods, achieving the
highest F1-Score of 0.8831 while maintaining stable convergence. While the
baseline FedAvg was the most computationally efficient, its predictive
performance was substantially lower. Our findings indicate that
regularization-based FL algorithms like FedProx offer a more robust and
effective solution for heterogeneous and imbalanced clinical prediction tasks
than standard or server-side adaptive aggregation methods. The work provides a
crucial empirical benchmark for selecting appropriate FL strategies for
real-world healthcare applications.

Motivation: 解决个性化联邦学习在标签倾斜和非平稳性下的失败问题，传统单一全局参数化忽略了客户端特定的几何结构。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) often fails under label skew and
non-stationarity because a single global parameterization ignores
client-specific geometry. We introduce VGM$^2$ (Variational Gaussian Mixture
Manifold), a geometry-centric PFL framework that (i) learns client-specific
parametric UMAP embeddings, (ii) models latent pairwise distances with mixture
relation markers for same and different class pairs, and (iii) exchanges only
variational, uncertainty-aware marker statistics. Each client maintains a
Dirichlet-Normal-Inverse-Gamma (Dir-NIG) posterior over marker weights, means,
and variances; the server aggregates via conjugate moment matching to form
global priors that guide subsequent rounds. We prove that this aggregation
minimizes the summed reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence from client posteriors
within the conjugate family, yielding stability under heterogeneity. We further
incorporate a calibration term for distance-to-similarity mapping and report
communication and compute budgets. Across eight vision datasets with non-IID
label shards, VGM$^2$ achieves competitive or superior test F1 scores compared
to strong baselines while communicating only small geometry summaries. Privacy
is strengthened through secure aggregation and optional differential privacy
noise, and we provide a membership-inference stress test. Code and
configurations will be released to ensure full reproducibility.

Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition
characterized by atypical brain maturation. However, the adaptation of transfer
learning paradigms in machine learning for ASD research remains notably
limited. In this study, we propose a computer-aided diagnostic framework with
two modules. This chapter presents a two-module framework combining deep
learning and explainable AI for ASD diagnosis. The first module leverages a
deep learning model fine-tuned through cross-domain transfer learning for ASD
classification. The second module focuses on interpreting the model decisions
and identifying critical brain regions. To achieve this, we employed three
explainable AI (XAI) techniques: saliency mapping, Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. This
framework demonstrates that cross-domain transfer learning can effectively
address data scarcity in ASD research. In addition, by applying three
established explainability techniques, the approach reveals how the model makes
diagnostic decisions and identifies brain regions most associated with ASD.
These findings were compared against established neurobiological evidence,
highlighting strong alignment and reinforcing the clinical relevance of the
proposed approach.

Abstract: We propose a geometric extension of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) by
allowing weights to take values in abstract groups such as \(
\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{R}) \), \( \mathrm{SU}(2) \), or even
infinite-dimensional operator groups. This generalization enables the modeling
of complex relational structures, including projective transformations, spinor
dynamics, and functional symmetries, with direct applications to vision,
language, and quantum learning.
  A central contribution of this work is the introduction of a
\emph{contextuality index} based on group-valued holonomies computed along
cycles in the RBM graph. This index quantifies the global inconsistency or
"curvature" induced by local weights, generalizing classical notions of
coherence, consistency, and geometric flatness. We establish links with
sheaf-theoretic contextuality, gauge theory, and noncommutative geometry, and
provide numerical and diagrammatic examples in both finite and infinite

  This framework opens novel directions in AI, from curvature-aware learning

Abstract: Efficient Federated learning (FL) is crucial for training deep networks over
devices with limited compute resources and bounded networks. With the advent of
big data, devices either generate or collect multimodal data to train either
generic or local-context aware networks, particularly when data privacy and
locality is vital. FL algorithms generally trade-off between parallel and
statistical performance, improving model quality at the cost of higher
communication frequency, or vice versa. Under frequent synchronization
settings, FL over a large cluster of devices may perform more work per-training
iteration by processing a larger global batch-size, thus attaining considerable
training speedup. However, this may result in poor test performance (i.e., low
test loss or accuracy) due to generalization degradation issues associated with
large-batch training. To address these challenges with large-batches, this work
proposes our vision of exploiting the trade-offs between small and large-batch
training, and explore new directions to enjoy both the parallel scaling of
large-batches and good generalizability of small-batch training. For the same
number of iterations, we observe that our proposed large-batch training
technique attains about 32.33% and 3.74% higher test accuracy than small-batch
training in ResNet50 and VGG11 models respectively.

Abstract: Nonlinear system identification often involves a fundamental trade-off
between interpretability and flexibility, often requiring the incorporation of
physical constraints. We propose a unified data-driven framework that combines
the mathematical structure of the governing differential equations with the
flexibility of neural networks (NNs). At the core of our approach is the
concept of characteristic curves (CCs), which represent individual nonlinear
functions (e.g., friction and restoring components) of the system. Each CC is
modeled by a dedicated NN, enabling a modular and interpretable representation
of the system equation. To demonstrate the versatility of the CC-based
formalism, we introduce three identification strategies: (1) SINDy-CC, which
extends the sparse regression approach of SINDy by incorporating the
mathematical structure of the governing equations as constraints; (2) Poly-CC,
which represents each CC using high-degree polynomials; and (3) NN-CC, which
uses NNs without requiring prior assumptions about basis functions. Our results
show that all three approaches are well-suited for systems with simple
polynomial nonlinearities, such as the van der Pol oscillator. In contrast,
NN-CC demonstrates superior performance in modeling systems with complex
nonlinearities and discontinuities, such as those observed in stick-slip
systems. The key contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the CC-based
framework, particularly the NN-CC approach, can capture complex nonlinearities
while maintaining interpretability through the explicit representation of the
CCs. This balance makes it well-suited for modeling systems with
discontinuities and complex nonlinearities that are challenging to assess using
traditional polynomial or sparse regression methods, providing a powerful tool
for nonlinear system identification.

Abstract: Machine learning has shown promise in facial dysmorphology, where
characteristic facial features provide diagnostic clues for rare genetic
disorders. GestaltMatcher, a leading framework in this field, has demonstrated
clinical utility across multiple studies, but its reliance on centralized
datasets limits further development, as patient data are siloed across
institutions and subject to strict privacy regulations. We introduce a
federated GestaltMatcher service based on a cross-silo horizontal federated
learning framework, which allows hospitals to collaboratively train a global
ensemble feature extractor without sharing patient images. Patient data are
mapped into a shared latent space, and a privacy-preserving kernel matrix
computation framework enables syndrome inference and discovery while
safeguarding confidentiality. New participants can directly benefit from and
contribute to the system by adopting the global feature extractor and kernel
configuration from previous training rounds. Experiments show that the
federated service retains over 90% of centralized performance and remains
robust to both varying silo numbers and heterogeneous data distributions.

Conclusion: M4GN通过创新的分段策略和分层架构，在保持计算效率的同时显著提高了物理模拟的准确性

Abstract: Mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have become effective surrogates for
PDE simulations, yet their deep message passing incurs high cost and
over-smoothing on large, long-range meshes; hierarchical GNNs shorten
propagation paths but still face two key obstacles: (i) building coarse graphs
that respect mesh topology, geometry, and physical discontinuities, and (ii)
maintaining fine-scale accuracy without sacrificing the speed gained from
coarsening. We tackle these challenges with M4GN, a three-tier, segment-centric
hierarchical network. M4GN begins with a hybrid segmentation strategy that
pairs a fast graph partitioner with a superpixel-style refinement guided by
modal-decomposition features, producing contiguous segments of dynamically
consistent nodes. These segments are encoded by a permutation-invariant
aggregator, avoiding the order sensitivity and quadratic cost of aggregation
approaches used in prior works. The resulting information bridges a micro-level
GNN, which captures local dynamics, and a macro-level transformer that reasons
efficiently across segments, achieving a principled balance between accuracy
and efficiency. Evaluated on multiple representative benchmark datasets, M4GN
improves prediction accuracy by up to 56% while achieving up to 22% faster
inference than state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Multi-label learning often requires identifying all relevant labels for
training instances, but collecting full label annotations is costly and
labor-intensive. In many datasets, only a single positive label is annotated
per training instance, despite the presence of multiple relevant labels. This
setting, known as single-positive multi-label learning (SPMLL), presents a
significant challenge due to its extreme form of partial supervision. We
propose a model-agnostic approach to SPMLL that draws on conformal prediction
to produce calibrated set-valued outputs, enabling reliable multi-label
predictions at test time. Our method bridges the supervision gap between
single-label training and multi-label evaluation without relying on label
distribution assumptions. We evaluate our approach on 12 benchmark datasets,
demonstrating consistent improvements over existing baselines and practical
applicability.

CogGNN, which endows GNNs with cognitive capabilities (e.g., visual memory) to
generate brain networks that preserve cognitive features. While broadly
applicable, we present CogGNN, a specific variant designed to integrate visual
input, a key factor in brain functions like pattern recognition and memory
recall. As a proof of concept, we use our model to learn connectional brain
templates (CBTs), population-level fingerprints from multi-view brain networks.
Unlike prior work that overlooks cognitive properties, CogGNN generates CBTs
that are both cognitively and structurally meaningful. Our contributions are:
(i) a novel cognition-aware generative model with a visual-memory-based loss;
(ii) a CBT-learning framework with a co-optimization strategy to yield
well-centered, discriminative, cognitively enhanced templates. Extensive

Abstract: Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is an inherently challenging
problem, as it requires the identification of rare nodes that deviate from the
majority in both their structural and behavioral characteristics. Existing
methods, such as those based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), often
suffer from over-smoothing, which causes the learned node representations to
become indistinguishable. Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches
are vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction
process, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a
novel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key
components: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction
mechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components
work synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and
global structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and
assess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity. Anomaly scores are
computed by combining reconstruction errors and memory matching signals,
resulting in a more robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, offering a comprehensive and generalizable solution for anomaly
detection across various graph domains.

Abstract: Strategies to improve the predicting performance of Message-Passing
Neural-Networks for molecular property predictions can be achieved by
simplifying how the message is passed and by using descriptors that capture
multiple aspects of molecular graphs. In this work, we designed model
architectures that achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing more
complex models such as those pre-trained on external databases. We assessed
dataset diversity to complement our performance results, finding that
structural diversity influences the need for additional components in our MPNNs
and feature sets.
  In most datasets, our best architecture employs bidirectional message-passing
with an attention mechanism, applied to a minimalist message formulation that
excludes self-perception, highlighting that relatively simpler models, compared
to classical MPNNs, yield higher class separability. In contrast, we found that
convolution normalization factors do not benefit the predictive power in all
the datasets tested. This was corroborated in both global and node-level
outputs. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of both adding spatial
features and working with 3D graphs, finding that 2D molecular graphs are
sufficient when complemented with appropriately chosen 3D descriptors. This
approach not only preserves predictive performance but also reduces
computational cost by over 50%, making it particularly advantageous for
high-throughput screening campaigns.

Abstract: Federated Object Detection (FOD) enables clients to collaboratively train a
global object detection model without accessing their local data from diverse
domains. However, significant variations in environment, weather, and other
domain specific factors hinder performance, making cross domain generalization
a key challenge. Existing FOD methods often overlook the hardware constraints
of edge devices and introduce local training regularizations that incur high
computational costs, limiting real-world applicability. In this paper, we
propose FEDEXCHANGE, a novel FOD framework that bridges domain gaps without
introducing additional local computational overhead. FEDEXCHANGE employs a
server side dynamic model exchange strategy that enables each client to gain
insights from other clients' domain data without direct data sharing.
Specifically, FEDEXCHANGE allows the server to alternate between model
aggregation and model exchange. During aggregation rounds, the server
aggregates all local models as usual. In exchange rounds, FEDEXCHANGE clusters
and exchanges local models based on distance measures, allowing local models to
learn from a variety of domains. As all operations are performed on the server
side, clients can achieve improved cross domain utility without any additional
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FEDEXCHANGE
enhances FOD performance, achieving 1.6X better mean average precision in
challenging domains, such as rainy conditions, while requiring only 0.8X the
computational resources compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Signature-based methods have recently gained significant traction in machine
learning for sequential data. In particular, signature kernels have emerged as
powerful discriminators and training losses for generative models on
time-series, notably in quantitative finance. However, existing implementations
do not scale to the dataset sizes and sequence lengths encountered in practice.
We present pySigLib, a high-performance Python library offering optimised
implementations of signatures and signature kernels on CPU and GPU, fully
compatible with PyTorch's automatic differentiation. Beyond an efficient
software stack for large-scale signature-based computation, we introduce a
novel differentiation scheme for signature kernels that delivers accurate
gradients at a fraction of the runtime of existing libraries.

TL;DR: 提出了Zero Inflation Diffusion Framework (ZIDF)来处理降水预测中的零膨胀数据问题，通过高斯扰动、Transformer预测和扩散去噪技术，在多个指标上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水预测数据中存在大量零值和稀疏非零事件，这种零膨胀分布给传统预测方法带来巨大挑战，需要专门的处理框架。

Method: ZIDF整合了三个关键技术：1）高斯扰动平滑零膨胀分布；2）基于Transformer的时间模式预测；3）扩散去噪恢复原始数据结构。使用南澳大利亚观测数据和合成零膨胀数据进行实验。

Result: 相比基准Non-stationary Transformer，ZIDF实现了MSE降低56.7%，MAE降低21.1%的显著性能提升，在稀疏时间序列数据处理方面表现出色。

Conclusion: ZIDF能够鲁棒地处理稀疏时间序列数据，并具有推广到其他零膨胀问题领域的潜力。

Abstract: Zero-inflated data pose significant challenges in precipitation forecasting
due to the predominance of zeros with sparse non-zero events. To address this,
we propose the Zero Inflation Diffusion Framework (ZIDF), which integrates
Gaussian perturbation for smoothing zero-inflated distributions,
Transformer-based prediction for capturing temporal patterns, and
diffusion-based denoising to restore the original data structure. In our
experiments, we use observational precipitation data collected from South
Australia along with synthetically generated zero-inflated data. Results show
that ZIDF demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple
state-of-the-art precipitation forecasting models, achieving up to 56.7\%
reduction in MSE and 21.1\% reduction in MAE relative to the baseline
Non-stationary Transformer. These findings highlight ZIDF's ability to robustly
handle sparse time series data and suggest its potential generalizability to
other domains where zero inflation is a key challenge.

Conclusion: 联邦学习方法能在不集中敏感学生数据的情况下提供高效内容推荐，为教育平台的个性化-隐私困境提供可行解决方案

Abstract: The increasing digitalization of education presents unprecedented
opportunities for data-driven personalization, yet it introduces significant
student data privacy challenges. Conventional recommender systems rely on
centralized data, a paradigm often incompatible with modern data protection
regulations. A novel privacy-preserving recommender system is proposed and
evaluated to address this critical issue using Federated Learning (FL). The
approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features
from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative
analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx
as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous
student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model
achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28\%, corresponding to 82.85\% of
the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings
validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content
recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data. Consequently, our
work presents a viable and robust solution to the personalization-privacy
dilemma in modern educational platforms.

Motivation: 近似乘法器(AppMults)在深度学习加速器中广泛应用以减少面积、延迟和功耗，但会引入算术误差，需要重训练来恢复精度。现有方法使用精确乘法器的梯度进行估计，导致重训练结果不理想

Method: 提出两种方法：1) LUT-2D使用二维查找表精细表征近似乘法器梯度；2) LUT-1D使用一维查找表作为更高效的变体

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，LUT-2D和LUT-1D分别平均提高重训练精度3.83%和3.72%；在ImageNet上，LUT-1D平均提高23.69%

Conclusion: 所提方法能显著提高使用近似乘法器的深度学习模型的重训练精度，LUT-2D精度最高，LUT-1D效率更优

Abstract: Approximate multipliers (AppMults) are widely used in deep learning
accelerators to reduce their area, delay, and power consumption. However,
AppMults introduce arithmetic errors into deep learning models, necessitating a
retraining process to recover accuracy. A key step in retraining is computing
the gradient of the AppMult, i.e., the partial derivative of the approximate
product with respect to each input operand. Existing approaches typically
estimate this gradient using that of the accurate multiplier (AccMult), which
can lead to suboptimal retraining results. To address this, we propose two
methods to obtain more precise gradients of AppMults. The first, called LUT-2D,
characterizes the AppMult gradient with 2-dimensional lookup tables (LUTs),
providing fine-grained estimation and achieving the highest retraining
accuracy. The second, called LUT-1D, is a compact and more efficient variant
that stores gradient values in 1-dimensional LUTs, achieving comparable
retraining accuracy with shorter runtime. Experimental results show that on
CIFAR-10 with convolutional neural networks, our LUT-2D and LUT-1D methods
improve retraining accuracy by 3.83% and 3.72% on average, respectively. On
ImageNet with vision transformer models, our LUT-1D method improves retraining
accuracy by 23.69% on average, compared to a state-of-the-art retraining
framework.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is essential for balancing risk and return in
financial decision-making. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has stood out as a
cutting-edge tool for portfolio optimization that learns dynamic asset
allocation using trial-and-error interactions. However, most DRL-based methods
are restricted to allocating assets within a pre-defined investment universe
and overlook exploring new opportunities. This study introduces an investment
landscape that integrates exploiting existing assets with exploring new
investment opportunities in an extended universe. The proposed approach
leverages two DRL agents and dynamically balances these objectives to adapt to
evolving markets while enhancing portfolio performance. One agent allocates
assets within the existing universe, while another assists in exploring new
opportunities in the extended universe. The effciency of the proposed
methodology is determined using two real-world market data sets. The
experiments demonstrate the superiority of the suggested approach against the
state-of-the-art portfolio strategies and baseline methods.

Abstract: Geodetic time series -- such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
positions, satellite altimetry-derived sea surface height (SSH), and tide gauge
(TG) records -- is essential for monitoring surface deformation and sea level
change. Accurate forecasts of these variables can enhance early warning systems
and support hazard mitigation for earthquakes, landslides, coastal storm surge,
and long-term sea level. However, the nonlinear, non-stationary, and incomplete
nature of such variables presents significant challenges for classic models,
which often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex spatiotemporal
dynamics. We introduce GTS Forecaster, an open-source Python package for
geodetic time series forecasting. It integrates advanced deep learning models
-- including kernel attention networks (KAN), graph neural network-based gated
recurrent units (GNNGRU), and time-aware graph neural networks (TimeGNN) -- to
effectively model nonlinear spatial-temporal patterns. The package also
provides robust preprocessing tools, including outlier detection and a
reinforcement learning-based gap-filling algorithm, the Kalman-TransFusion
Interpolation Framework (KTIF). GTS Forecaster currently supports forecasting,
visualization, and evaluation of GNSS, SSH, and TG datasets, and is adaptable
to general time series applications. By combining cutting-edge models with an
accessible interface, it facilitates the application of deep learning in
geodetic forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Matched-pair experimental designs aim to detect treatment effects by pairing
participants and comparing within-pair outcome differences. In many situations,
the overall effect size is small across the entire population. Then, the focus
naturally shifts to identifying and targeting high treatment-effect regions
where the intervention is most effective. This paper proposes a matched-pair
experimental design that sequentially and actively enrolls patients in high
treatment-effect regions. Importantly, we frame the identification of the
target region as a classification problem and propose an active learning
framework tailored to matched-pair designs. The proposed design not only
reduces the experimental cost of detecting treatment efficacy, but also ensures
that the identified regions enclose the entire high-treatment-effect regions.
Our theoretical analysis of the framework's label complexity, along with
experiments in practical scenarios, demonstrates the efficiency and advantages
of the approach.

Abstract: This work proposes a bid shading strategy for first-price auctions as a
measure-valued optimization problem. We consider a standard parametric form for
bid shading and formulate the problem as convex optimization over the joint
distribution of shading parameters. After each auction, the shading parameter
distribution is adapted via a regularized Wasserstein-proximal update with a
data-driven energy functional. This energy functional is conditional on the
context, i.e., on publisher/user attributes such as domain, ad slot type,
device, or location. The proposed algorithm encourages the bid distribution to
place more weight on values with higher expected surplus, i.e., where the win
probability and the value gap are both large. We show that the resulting
measure-valued convex optimization problem admits a closed form solution. A
numerical example illustrates the proposed method.

Abstract: Volunteer-based food rescue platforms tackle food waste by matching surplus
food to communities in need. These platforms face the dual problem of
maintaining volunteer engagement and maximizing the food rescued. Existing
algorithms to improve volunteer engagement exacerbate geographical disparities,
leaving some communities systematically disadvantaged. We address this issue by
proposing Contextual Budget Bandit. Contextual Budget Bandit incorporates
context-dependent budget allocation in restless multi-armed bandits, a model of
decision-making which allows for stateful arms. By doing so, we can allocate
higher budgets to communities with lower match rates, thereby alleviating
geographical disparities. To tackle this problem, we develop an empirically
fast heuristic algorithm. Because the heuristic algorithm can achieve a poor
approximation when active volunteers are scarce, we design the Mitosis
algorithm, which is guaranteed to compute the optimal budget allocation.
Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms outperform baselines on both
synthetic and real-world food rescue datasets, and show how our algorithm
achieves geographical fairness in food rescue.

Abstract: The Multimarginal Schr\"odinger Bridge (MSB) finds the optimal coupling among
a collection of random vectors with known statistics and a known correlation
structure. In the MSB formulation, this correlation structure is specified
\emph{a priori} as an undirected connected graph with measure-valued vertices.
In this work, we formulate and solve the problem of finding the optimal MSB in
the sense we seek the optimal coupling over all possible graph structures. We
find that computing the optimal MSB amounts to solving the minimum spanning
tree problem over measure-valued vertices. We show that the resulting problem
can be solved in two steps. The first step constructs a complete graph with
edge weight equal to a sum of the optimal value of the corresponding bimarginal
SB and the entropies of the endpoints. The second step solves a standard
minimum spanning tree problem over that complete weighted graph. Numerical
experiments illustrate the proposed solution.
