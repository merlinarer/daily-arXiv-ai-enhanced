<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂指令跟随任务中忽视关键子上下文，影响监督微调（SFT）效果。

Method: 提出MISO框架，将顺序指令分解为并行子上下文，并引入混合上下文范式优化SFT。

Result: 实验证明MISO在复杂指令跟随任务中表现优越，且具有训练效率潜力。

Conclusion: MISO是一种有效的LLM微调方法，适用于复杂指令场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in handling
natural language tasks; however, they may struggle to consistently follow
complex instructions including those involve multiple constraints.
Post-training LLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach to
improve their ability to follow instructions. In addressing complex instruction
following, existing efforts primarily focus on data-driven methods that
synthesize complex instruction-output pairs for SFT. However, insufficient
attention allocated to crucial sub-contexts may reduce the effectiveness of
SFT. In this work, we propose transforming sequentially structured input
instruction into multiple parallel instructions containing subcontexts. To
support processing this multi-input, we propose MISO (Multi-Input
Single-Output), an extension to currently dominant decoder-only
transformer-based LLMs. MISO introduces a mixture-of-contexts paradigm that
jointly considers the overall instruction-output alignment and the influence of
individual sub-contexts to enhance SFT effectiveness. We apply MISO fine-tuning
to complex instructionfollowing datasets and evaluate it with standard LLM
inference. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of MISO as a
fine-tuning method for LLMs, both in terms of effectiveness in complex
instruction-following scenarios and its potential for training efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在神经元层面识别语言模型真实性表征的方法，发现模型存在与主题无关的‘真实性神经元’，并通过实验验证其普遍存在。抑制这些神经元会降低模型性能，表明真实性机制具有普适性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型有时会产生不真实的回答，而对其真实性机制的理解不足影响了其可靠性和安全性。

Method: 提出了一种识别神经元层面真实性表征的方法，并通过实验验证‘真实性神经元’的存在及其分布模式。

Result: 实验证实‘真实性神经元’普遍存在于不同规模的模型中，抑制其激活会显著降低模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型真实性的机制，为提升其可信度和可靠性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success and deployment across diverse workflows,
language models sometimes produce untruthful responses. Our limited
understanding of how truthfulness is mechanistically encoded within these
models jeopardizes their reliability and safety. In this paper, we propose a
method for identifying representations of truthfulness at the neuron level. We
show that language models contain truth neurons, which encode truthfulness in a
subject-agnostic manner. Experiments conducted across models of varying scales
validate the existence of truth neurons, confirming that the encoding of
truthfulness at the neuron level is a property shared by many language models.
The distribution patterns of truth neurons over layers align with prior
findings on the geometry of truthfulness. Selectively suppressing the
activations of truth neurons found through the TruthfulQA dataset degrades
performance both on TruthfulQA and on other benchmarks, showing that the
truthfulness mechanisms are not tied to a specific dataset. Our results offer
novel insights into the mechanisms underlying truthfulness in language models
and highlight potential directions toward improving their trustworthiness and
reliability.

TL;DR: HBO是一种用于LLM微调的分层平衡优化方法，通过全局和局部数据分配调整，解决了数据不平衡和异质性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理数据不平衡和异质性时，通常仅关注全局层面（跨数据集），而忽略了局部层面（数据集内部），限制了其效果。

Method: HBO采用双层优化策略，包括一个全局角色（平衡跨数据集采样）和多个局部角色（基于难度优化数据集内部使用）。

Result: 在九个多语言和多任务实验中，HBO显著优于现有基线方法，实现了更高的准确性。

Conclusion: HBO为LLM微调中的数据不平衡和异质性提供了全面解决方案，提升了训练效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on a mixture of diverse datasets
poses challenges due to data imbalance and heterogeneity. Existing methods
often address these issues across datasets (globally) but overlook the
imbalance and heterogeneity within individual datasets (locally), which limits
their effectiveness. We introduce Hierarchical Balancing Optimization (HBO), a
novel method that enables LLMs to autonomously adjust data allocation during
fine-tuning both across datasets (globally) and within each individual dataset
(locally). HBO employs a bilevel optimization strategy with two types of
actors: a Global Actor, which balances data sampling across different subsets
of the training mixture, and several Local Actors, which optimizes data usage
within each subset based on difficulty levels. These actors are guided by
reward functions derived from the LLM's training state, which measure learning
progress and relative performance improvement. We evaluate HBO on three LLM
backbones across nine diverse tasks in multilingual and multitask setups.
Results show that HBO consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving
significant accuracy gains. Our in-depth analysis further demonstrates that
both the global actor and local actors of HBO effectively adjust data usage
during fine-tuning. HBO provides a comprehensive solution to the challenges of
data imbalance and heterogeneity in LLM fine-tuning, enabling more effective
training across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于树状思维（ToT）的强化学习框架ToTRL，通过并行生成和评估推理分支，提升LLM的推理效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维（CoT）推理存在冗长输出和缺乏系统性的问题，树状思维（ToT）提供了更高效的并行推理方法。

Method: 引入ToTRL框架，结合规则奖励和谜题游戏训练，引导LLM从序列CoT策略转向并行ToT策略。

Result: ToTQwen3-8B模型在复杂推理任务中表现出显著的性能提升和推理效率。

Conclusion: ToTRL框架有效提升了LLM的推理能力，为复杂任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant reasoning capabilities,
particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, which can be
elicited by reinforcement learning (RL). However, prolonged CoT reasoning
presents limitations, primarily verbose outputs due to excessive introspection.
The reasoning process in these LLMs often appears to follow a trial-and-error
methodology rather than a systematic, logical deduction. In contrast,
tree-of-thoughts (ToT) offers a conceptually more advanced approach by modeling
reasoning as an exploration within a tree structure. This reasoning structure
facilitates the parallel generation and evaluation of multiple reasoning
branches, allowing for the active identification, assessment, and pruning of
unproductive paths. This process can potentially lead to improved performance
and reduced token costs. Building upon the long CoT capability of LLMs, we
introduce tree-of-thoughts RL (ToTRL), a novel on-policy RL framework with a
rule-based reward. ToTRL is designed to guide LLMs in developing the parallel
ToT strategy based on the sequential CoT strategy. Furthermore, we employ LLMs
as players in a puzzle game during the ToTRL training process. Solving puzzle
games inherently necessitates exploring interdependent choices and managing
multiple constraints, which requires the construction and exploration of a
thought tree, providing challenging tasks for cultivating the ToT reasoning
capability. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that our ToTQwen3-8B model,
trained with our ToTRL, achieves significant improvement in performance and
reasoning efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Decentralized Arena (dearena)，一个利用所有LLMs集体智能相互评估的自动化框架，解决了现有基准测试方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法存在封闭式基准测试饱和、众包排行榜成本高以及自动化方法依赖少数权威模型导致偏见的问题。

Method: dearena通过民主化、成对评估减少单模型偏见，并采用粗到细排名算法和自动问题选择策略实现高效扩展。

Result: 在66个LLMs上的实验表明，dearena与人类判断的相关性高达97%，同时显著降低成本。

Conclusion: dearena为LLM评估提供了高效、低成本和低偏见的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent explosion of large language models (LLMs), each with its own
general or specialized strengths, makes scalable, reliable benchmarking more
urgent than ever. Standard practices nowadays face fundamental trade-offs:
closed-ended question-based benchmarks (eg MMLU) struggle with saturation as
newer models emerge, while crowd-sourced leaderboards (eg Chatbot Arena) rely
on costly and slow human judges. Recently, automated methods (eg
LLM-as-a-judge) shed light on the scalability, but risk bias by relying on one
or a few "authority" models. To tackle these issues, we propose Decentralized
Arena (dearena), a fully automated framework leveraging collective intelligence
from all LLMs to evaluate each other. It mitigates single-model judge bias by
democratic, pairwise evaluation, and remains efficient at scale through two key
components: (1) a coarse-to-fine ranking algorithm for fast incremental
insertion of new models with sub-quadratic complexity, and (2) an automatic
question selection strategy for the construction of new evaluation dimensions.
Across extensive experiments across 66 LLMs, dearena attains up to 97%
correlation with human judgements, while significantly reducing the cost. Our
code and data will be publicly released on
https://github.com/maitrix-org/de-arena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码是LLM推理的标准方法，但其顺序性导致效率低下。现有推测解码算法未能充分利用语言复杂性的异构性，导致资源分配不优。

Method: 提出HeteroSpec框架，包括：(1) 基于累积元路径Top-K熵的上下文预测机制；(2) 基于数据驱动熵分区的动态资源分配策略。

Result: 在五个基准测试和四个模型上，HeteroSpec平均加速4.26倍，优于现有EAGLE-3方法。

Conclusion: HeteroSpec无需重新训练草稿模型，开销低，且与其他加速技术正交，为上下文感知的LLM推理加速提供了新范式。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding, the standard approach for Large Language Model (LLM)
inference, remains a significant bottleneck due to its sequential nature. While
speculative decoding algorithms mitigate this inefficiency through parallel
verification, they fail to exploit the inherent heterogeneity in linguistic
complexity, a key factor leading to suboptimal resource allocation. We address
this by proposing HeteroSpec, a heterogeneity-adaptive speculative decoding
framework that dynamically optimizes computational resource allocation based on
linguistic context complexity. HeteroSpec introduces two key mechanisms: (1) A
novel cumulative meta-path Top-$K$ entropy metric for efficiently identifying
predictable contexts. (2) A dynamic resource allocation strategy based on
data-driven entropy partitioning, enabling adaptive speculative expansion and
pruning tailored to local context difficulty. Evaluated on five public
benchmarks and four models, HeteroSpec achieves an average speedup of
4.26$\times$. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art EAGLE-3 across
speedup rates, average acceptance length, and verification cost. Notably,
HeteroSpec requires no draft model retraining, incurs minimal overhead, and is
orthogonal to other acceleration techniques. It demonstrates enhanced
acceleration with stronger draft models, establishing a new paradigm for
context-aware LLM inference acceleration.

Result: 多智能体系统在所有模型中表现不及单智能体，且与人类群体行为存在细微差异。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个可复现的评估框架，并推动人工集体智能和人机交互的未来研究。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving through distributed information integration, but also risk
replicating collective reasoning failures observed in human groups. Yet, no
theory-grounded benchmark exists to systematically evaluate such failures. In
this paper, we introduce the Hidden Profile paradigm from social psychology as
a diagnostic testbed for multi-agent LLM systems. By distributing critical
information asymmetrically across agents, the paradigm reveals how inter-agent
dynamics support or hinder collective reasoning. We first formalize the
paradigm for multi-agent decision-making under distributed knowledge and
instantiate it as a benchmark with nine tasks spanning diverse scenarios,
including adaptations from prior human studies. We then conduct experiments
with GPT-4.1 and five other leading LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced
variants, showing that multi-agent systems across all models fail to match the
accuracy of single agents given complete information. While agents' collective
performance is broadly comparable to that of human groups, nuanced behavioral
differences emerge, such as increased sensitivity to social desirability.
Finally, we demonstrate the paradigm's diagnostic utility by exploring a
cooperation-contradiction trade-off in multi-agent LLM systems. We find that
while cooperative agents are prone to over-coordination in collective settings,
increased contradiction impairs group convergence. This work contributes a
reproducible framework for evaluating multi-agent LLM systems and motivates
future research on artificial collective intelligence and human-AI interaction.

Method: 提出了一种基于行为方法（MCMC）与神经表征对齐的系统化方法，识别导向向量，并应用于风险偏好的调整。

Result: 实验表明，导向向量能够可靠地调整LLM的输出，使其符合目标行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM行为的精确控制提供了一种新途径，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Changing the behavior of large language models (LLMs) can be as
straightforward as editing the Transformer's residual streams using
appropriately constructed "steering vectors." These modifications to internal
neural activations, a form of representation engineering, offer an effective
and targeted means of influencing model behavior without retraining or
fine-tuning the model. But how can such steering vectors be systematically
identified? We propose a principled approach for uncovering steering vectors by
aligning latent representations elicited through behavioral methods
(specifically, Markov chain Monte Carlo with LLMs) with their neural
counterparts. To evaluate this approach, we focus on extracting latent risk
preferences from LLMs and steering their risk-related outputs using the aligned
representations as steering vectors. We show that the resulting steering
vectors successfully and reliably modulate LLM outputs in line with the
targeted behavior.

Conclusion: CGD通过结合批评和精炼响应，有效提升了SFT的效果，同时减少了不确定性。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using expert demonstrations often suffer from
the imitation problem, where the model learns to reproduce the correct
responses without \emph{understanding} the underlying rationale. To address
this limitation, we propose \textsc{Critique-Guided Distillation (CGD)}, a
novel multi-stage framework that integrates teacher model generated
\emph{explanatory critiques} and \emph{refined responses} into the SFT process.
A student model is then trained to map the triplet of prompt, teacher critique,
and its own initial response to the corresponding refined teacher response,
thereby learning both \emph{what} to imitate and \emph{why}. Using
entropy-based analysis, we show that \textsc{CGD} reduces refinement
uncertainty and can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior update. We perform
extensive empirical evaluation of \textsc{CGD}, on variety of benchmark tasks,
and demonstrate significant gains on both math (AMC23 +17.5%) and language
understanding tasks (MMLU-Pro +6.3%), while successfully mitigating the format
drift issues observed in previous critique fine-tuning (CFT) techniques.

Result: Cognivolve在优化步数减半的情况下达到目标精度，推理头数量显著增加且注意力熵更高，但最终答案成功率仍落后30%。

Conclusion: 课程学习的顺序对模型性能至关重要，但仍有改进空间，如混合阶段微调和探测扩展。

Abstract: We demonstrate that a developmentally ordered curriculum markedly improves
reasoning transparency and sample-efficiency in small language models (SLMs).
Concretely, we train Cognivolve, a 124 M-parameter GPT-2 model, on a four-stage
syllabus that ascends from lexical matching to multi-step symbolic inference
and then evaluate it without any task-specific fine-tuning. Cognivolve reaches
target accuracy in half the optimization steps of a single-phase baseline,
activates an order-of-magnitude more gradient-salient reasoning heads, and
shifts those heads toward deeper layers, yielding higher-entropy attention that
balances local and long-range context. The same curriculum applied out of order
or with optimizer resets fails to reproduce these gains, confirming that
progression--not extra compute--drives the effect. We also identify open
challenges: final-answer success still lags a conventional run by about 30%,
and our saliency probe under-detects verbal-knowledge heads in the hardest
stage, suggesting directions for mixed-stage fine-tuning and probe expansion.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, ensuring
their effectiveness across multiple languages presents unique challenges.
Multilingual prompt engineering has emerged as a key approach to enhance LLMs'
capabilities in diverse linguistic settings without requiring extensive
parameter re-training or fine-tuning. With growing interest in multilingual
prompt engineering over the past two to three years, researchers have explored
various strategies to improve LLMs' performance across languages and NLP tasks.
By crafting structured natural language prompts, researchers have successfully
extracted knowledge from LLMs across different languages, making these
techniques an accessible pathway for a broader audience, including those
without deep expertise in machine learning, to harness the capabilities of
LLMs. In this paper, we survey and categorize different multilingual prompting
techniques based on the NLP tasks they address across a diverse set of datasets
that collectively span around 250 languages. We further highlight the LLMs
employed, present a taxonomy of approaches and discuss potential
state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods for specific multilingual datasets.
Additionally, we derive a range of insights across language families and
resource levels (high-resource vs. low-resource), including analyses such as
the distribution of NLP tasks by language resource type and the frequency of
prompting methods across different language families. Our survey reviews 36
research papers covering 39 prompting techniques applied to 30 multilingual NLP
tasks, with the majority of these studies published in the last two years.

Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving
accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs),
which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool
calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods of ambiguity handling either
exploit ReACT framework to produce the correct mapping through trial and error,
or supervised fine tuning to guide models to produce a biased mapping to
improve certain tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that
characterizes the representation difference of ambiguous text in the latent
space and leverage the difference to identify ambiguity before mapping them to
structured data. To detect ambiguity of a sentence, we focused on the
relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations and what
cause the LLM ignore multiple interpretations. Different to the distance
calculated by dense embedding vectors, we utilize the observation that
ambiguity is caused by concept missing in latent space of LLM to design a new
distance measurement, computed through the path kernel by the integral of
gradient values for each concepts from sparse-autoencoder (SAE) under each
state. We identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous questions with this
measurement. Based on our observation, We propose a new framework to improve
the performance of LLMs on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing
concepts prediction.

Conclusion: 初始空语义token是LLM中一个有效的控制点，为推理时优化和模型可解释性提供新视角。

Abstract: Recently, training-free methods for improving large language models (LLMs)
have attracted growing interest, with token-level attention tuning emerging as
a promising and interpretable direction. However, existing methods typically
rely on auxiliary mechanisms to identify important or irrelevant task-specific
tokens, introducing potential bias and limiting applicability. In this paper,
we uncover a surprising and elegant alternative: the semantically empty initial
token is a powerful and underexplored control point for optimizing model
behavior. Through theoretical analysis, we show that tuning the initial token's
attention sharpens or flattens the attention distribution over subsequent
tokens, and its role as an attention sink amplifies this effect. Empirically,
we find that: (1) tuning its attention improves LLM performance more
effectively than tuning other task-specific tokens; (2) the effect follows a
consistent trend across layers, with earlier layers having greater impact, but
varies across attention heads, with different heads showing distinct
preferences in how they attend to this token. Based on these findings, we
propose ZeroTuning, a training-free approach that improves LLM performance by
applying head-specific attention adjustments to this special token. Despite
tuning only one token, ZeroTuning achieves higher performance on text
classification, multiple-choice, and multi-turn conversation tasks across
models such as Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek. For example, ZeroTuning improves
Llama-3.1-8B by 11.71% on classification, 2.64% on QA tasks, and raises its
multi-turn score from 7.804 to 7.966. The method is also robust to limited
resources, few-shot settings, long contexts, quantization, decoding strategies,
and prompt variations. Our work sheds light on a previously overlooked control
point in LLMs, offering new insights into both inference-time tuning and model
interpretability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and commonsense

However, existing LLM agent frameworks have not fully utilized past experiences
for improvement. This work introduces a new LLM-based agent framework called
Retrospex, which addresses this challenge by analyzing past experiences in
depth. Unlike previous approaches, Retrospex does not directly integrate
experiences into the LLM's context. Instead, it combines the LLM's action
likelihood with action values estimated by a Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Critic, which is trained on past experiences through an offline
''retrospection'' process. Additionally, Retrospex employs a dynamic action
rescoring mechanism that increases the importance of experience-based values
for tasks that require more interaction with the environment. We evaluate
Retrospex in ScienceWorld, ALFWorld and Webshop environments, demonstrating its
advantages over strong, contemporary baselines.

Abstract: General-purpose large language models demonstrate notable capabilities in
language comprehension and generation, achieving results that are comparable
to, or even surpass, human performance in many language information processing
tasks. Nevertheless, when general models are applied to some specific domains,
e.g., Classical Chinese texts, their effectiveness is often unsatisfactory, and
fine-tuning open-source foundational models similarly struggles to adequately
incorporate domain-specific knowledge. To address this challenge, this study
developed a large language model, AI Taiyan, specifically designed for
understanding and generating Classical Chinese. Experiments show that with a
reasonable model design, data processing, foundational training, and
fine-tuning, satisfactory results can be achieved with only 1.8 billion
parameters. In key tasks related to Classical Chinese information processing
such as punctuation, identification of allusions, explanation of word meanings,
and translation between ancient and modern Chinese, this model exhibits a clear
advantage over both general-purpose large models and domain-specific
traditional models, achieving levels close to or surpassing human baselines.
This research provides a reference for the efficient construction of
specialized domain-specific large language models. Furthermore, the paper
discusses the application of this model in fields such as the collation of
ancient texts, dictionary editing, and language research, combined with case
studies.

Motivation: 解决传统Transformer模型在训练和推理中缺乏灵活性和可扩展性的问题，提出一种能够渐进式扩展模型大小并支持弹性推理的新架构。

Method: 1. 提出Chain-of-Representation (CoR)概念，将隐藏状态分解为多个子表示链；2. 设计CoLM，将CoM思想融入Transformer层；3. 引入CoLM-Air，通过KV共享机制进一步优化。

Conclusion: CoM为语言模型的设计提供了新思路，通过链式结构和KV共享机制实现了高效训练和灵活推理。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm, termed Chain-of-Model
(CoM), which incorporates the causal relationship into the hidden states of
each layer as a chain style, thereby introducing great scaling efficiency in
model training and inference flexibility in deployment. We introduce the
concept of Chain-of-Representation (CoR), which formulates the hidden states at
each layer as a combination of multiple sub-representations (i.e., chains) at
the hidden dimension level. In each layer, each chain from the output
representations can only view all of its preceding chains in the input
representations. Consequently, the model built upon CoM framework can
progressively scale up the model size by increasing the chains based on the
previous models (i.e., chains), and offer multiple sub-models at varying sizes
for elastic inference by using different chain numbers. Based on this
principle, we devise Chain-of-Language-Model (CoLM), which incorporates the
idea of CoM into each layer of Transformer architecture. Based on CoLM, we
further introduce CoLM-Air by introducing a KV sharing mechanism, that computes
all keys and values within the first chain and then shares across all chains.
This design demonstrates additional extensibility, such as enabling seamless LM
switching, prefilling acceleration and so on. Experimental results demonstrate
our CoLM family can achieve comparable performance to the standard Transformer,
while simultaneously enabling greater flexiblity, such as progressive scaling
to improve training efficiency and offer multiple varying model sizes for
elastic inference, paving a a new way toward building language models. Our code
will be released in the future at: https://github.com/microsoft/CoLM.

Motivation: 现有方法对长链推理中的所有思考进行均等压缩，限制了推理的效率和效果。本文旨在通过区分重要和非重要思考来提升推理效率。

Method: 1. 通过自动分块和蒙特卡洛模拟评估思考的重要性；2. 提出联合衡量有效性和效率的指标；3. 设计Long⊗Short框架，分别用长思考和短思考LLM协作解决问题；4. 使用少量冷启动数据微调LLM；5. 提出多轮强化学习优化协作。

Conclusion: Long⊗Short框架显著提升了推理效率，同时保持了性能，为LLM推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Compressing long chain-of-thought (CoT) from large language models (LLMs) is
an emerging strategy to improve the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. Despite its
promising benefits, existing studies equally compress all thoughts within a
long CoT, hindering more concise and effective reasoning. To this end, we first
investigate the importance of different thoughts by examining their
effectiveness and efficiency in contributing to reasoning through automatic
long CoT chunking and Monte Carlo rollouts. Building upon the insights, we
propose a theoretically bounded metric to jointly measure the effectiveness and
efficiency of different thoughts. We then propose Long$\otimes$Short, an
efficient reasoning framework that enables two LLMs to collaboratively solve
the problem: a long-thought LLM for more effectively generating important
thoughts, while a short-thought LLM for efficiently generating remaining
thoughts. Specifically, we begin by synthesizing a small amount of cold-start
data to fine-tune LLMs for long-thought and short-thought reasoning styles,
respectively. Furthermore, we propose a synergizing-oriented multi-turn
reinforcement learning, focusing on the model self-evolution and collaboration
between long-thought and short-thought LLMs. Experimental results show that our
method enables Qwen2.5-7B and Llama3.1-8B to achieve comparable performance
compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, while
reducing token length by over 80% across the MATH500, AIME24/25, AMC23, and
GPQA Diamond benchmarks. Our data and code are available at

Method: 提出MCD方法，通过自动优化连续软安全提示，提升多语言安全性。构建多语言版本的越狱基准数据集进行评估。

Result: MCD在多语言越狱防御中表现优于现有方法，并展现出强大的语言迁移能力。

Conclusion: MCD为LLM的多语言安全提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: The robustness and security of large language models (LLMs) has become a
prominent research area. One notable vulnerability is the ability to bypass LLM
safeguards by translating harmful queries into rare or underrepresented
languages, a simple yet effective method of "jailbreaking" these models.
Despite the growing concern, there has been limited research addressing the
safeguarding of LLMs in multilingual scenarios, highlighting an urgent need to
enhance multilingual safety. In this work, we investigate the correlation
between various attack features across different languages and propose
Multilingual Collaborative Defense (MCD), a novel learning method that
optimizes a continuous, soft safety prompt automatically to facilitate
multilingual safeguarding of LLMs. The MCD approach offers three advantages:
First, it effectively improves safeguarding performance across multiple
languages. Second, MCD maintains strong generalization capabilities while
minimizing false refusal rates. Third, MCD mitigates the language safety
misalignment caused by imbalances in LLM training corpora. To evaluate the
effectiveness of MCD, we manually construct multilingual versions of commonly
used jailbreak benchmarks, such as MaliciousInstruct and AdvBench, to assess
various safeguarding methods. Additionally, we introduce these datasets in
underrepresented (zero-shot) languages to verify the language transferability
of MCD. The results demonstrate that MCD outperforms existing approaches in
safeguarding against multilingual jailbreak attempts while also exhibiting
strong language transfer capabilities. Our code is available at

Abstract: Model editing techniques are essential for efficiently updating knowledge in
large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of existing approaches
degrades in massive editing scenarios, particularly when evaluated with

embedding collisions among knowledge items, which undermine editing reliability
at scale. To address this, we propose NAMET (Noise-aware Model Editing in
Transformers), a simple yet effective method that introduces noise during
memory extraction via a one-line modification to MEMIT. Extensive experiments
across six LLMs and three datasets demonstrate that NAMET consistently
outperforms existing methods when editing thousands of facts.

Conclusion: RLAP通过结合强化学习和LLM，显著提升了多步NLP任务的性能。

Abstract: Multi-step planning has been widely employed to enhance the performance of
large language models (LLMs) on downstream natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, which decomposes the original task into multiple subtasks and guide LLMs
to solve them sequentially without additional training. When addressing task
instances, existing methods either preset the order of steps or attempt
multiple paths at each step. However, these methods overlook instances'
linguistic features and rely on the intrinsic planning capabilities of LLMs to
evaluate intermediate feedback and then select subtasks, resulting in
suboptimal outcomes. To better solve multi-step NLP tasks with LLMs, in this
paper we propose a Reinforcement Learning enhanced Adaptive Planning framework
(RLAP). In our framework, we model an NLP task as a Markov decision process
(MDP) and employ an LLM directly into the environment. In particular, a
lightweight Actor model is trained to estimate Q-values for natural language
sequences consisting of states and actions through reinforcement learning.
Therefore, during sequential planning, the linguistic features of each sequence
in the MDP can be taken into account, and the Actor model interacts with the
LLM to determine the optimal order of subtasks for each task instance. We apply
RLAP on three different types of NLP tasks and conduct extensive experiments on
multiple datasets to verify RLAP's effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: 提出的无嵌入检索框架高效且性能优越，适用于长上下文任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural
language processing, but their limited ability to retain long-term context
constrains performance on document-level or multi-turn tasks.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by retrieving relevant
information from an external corpus. However, existing RAG systems often rely
on embedding-based retrieval trained on corpus-level semantic similarity, which
can lead to retrieving content that is semantically similar in form but
misaligned with the question's true intent. Furthermore, recent RAG variants
construct graph- or hierarchy-based structures to improve retrieval accuracy,
resulting in significant computation and storage overhead. In this paper, we
propose an embedding-free retrieval framework. Our method leverages the logical
inferencing ability of LLMs in retrieval using iterative search space
refinement guided by our novel importance measure and extend our retrieval
results with logically related information without explicit graph construction.
Experiments on long-context QA benchmarks, including NovelQA and Marathon, show
that our approach outperforms strong baselines while reducing storage and
runtime by over an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了自我修正的机制，通过线性表示和提示诱导的变化，为模型的可解释性提供了新视角。

Abstract: We provide an explanation for the performance gains of intrinsic
self-correction, a process where a language model iteratively refines its
outputs without external feedback. More precisely, we investigate how prompting
induces interpretable changes in hidden states and thus affects the output
distributions. We hypothesize that each prompt-induced shift lies in a linear
span of some linear representation vectors, naturally separating tokens based
on individual concept alignment. Building around this idea, we give a
mathematical formulation of self-correction and derive a concentration result
for output tokens based on alignment magnitudes. Our experiments on text
detoxification with zephyr-7b-sft reveal a substantial gap in the inner
products of the prompt-induced shifts and the unembeddings of the top-100 most
toxic tokens vs. those of the unembeddings of the bottom-100 least toxic
tokens, under toxic instructions. This suggests that self-correction prompts
enhance a language model's capability of latent concept recognition. Our
analysis offers insights into the underlying mechanism of self-correction by
characterizing how prompting works explainably. For reproducibility, our code
is available.

Abstract: Considering the inherent limitations of parametric knowledge in large
language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely employed
to expand their knowledge scope. Since RAG has shown promise in
knowledge-intensive tasks like open-domain question answering, its broader
application to complex tasks and intelligent assistants has further advanced
its utility. Despite this progress, the underlying knowledge utilization
mechanisms of LLM-based RAG remain underexplored. In this paper, we present a
systematic investigation of the intrinsic mechanisms by which LLMs integrate
internal (parametric) and external (retrieved) knowledge in RAG scenarios.
Specially, we employ knowledge stream analysis at the macroscopic level, and
investigate the function of individual modules at the microscopic level.
Drawing on knowledge streaming analyses, we decompose the knowledge utilization
process into four distinct stages within LLM layers: knowledge refinement,
knowledge elicitation, knowledge expression, and knowledge contestation. We
further demonstrate that the relevance of passages guides the streaming of
knowledge through these stages. At the module level, we introduce a new method,
knowledge activation probability entropy (KAPE) for neuron identification
associated with either internal or external knowledge. By selectively
deactivating these neurons, we achieve targeted shifts in the LLM's reliance on
one knowledge source over the other. Moreover, we discern complementary roles
for multi-head attention and multi-layer perceptron layers during knowledge
formation. These insights offer a foundation for improving interpretability and
reliability in retrieval-augmented LLMs, paving the way for more robust and
transparent generative solutions in knowledge-intensive domains.

Result: 实验表明，1:1的领域与通用语料比例最优，模型在Math-500和AIME25基准上分别取得27.9%和83.3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: MoL框架有效解决了领域适应中的关键问题，显著提升了性能，同时避免了通用能力的退化。

Abstract: Although LLMs perform well in general tasks, domain-specific applications
suffer from hallucinations and accuracy limitations. CPT approaches encounter
two key issues: (1) domain-biased data degrades general language skills, and
(2) improper corpus-mixture ratios limit effective adaptation. To address
these, we propose a novel framework, Mixture of Losses (MoL), which decouples
optimization objectives for domain-specific and general corpora. Specifically,
cross-entropy (CE) loss is applied to domain data to ensure knowledge
acquisition, while Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence aligns general-corpus
training with the base model's foundational capabilities. This dual-loss
architecture preserves universal skills while enhancing domain expertise,
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, we validate that a 1:1
domain-to-general corpus ratio optimally balances training and overfitting
without the need for extensive tuning or resource-intensive experiments.
Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate significant performance gains compared
to traditional CPT approaches, which often suffer from degradation in general
language capabilities; our model achieves 27.9% higher accuracy on the Math-500
benchmark in the non-think reasoning mode, and an impressive 83.3% improvement
on the challenging AIME25 subset in the think mode, underscoring the
effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 自适应策略简单实用，兼容性强，能显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time alignment methods, such as Best-of-N sampling,
offer a simple and effective way to steer language models (LMs) toward
preferred behaviors using reward models (RM). However, these approaches can be
computationally expensive, especially when applied uniformly across prompts
without accounting for differences in alignment difficulty. In this work, we
propose a prompt-adaptive strategy for Best-of-N alignment that allocates
inference-time compute more efficiently. Motivated by latency concerns, we
develop a two-stage algorithm: an initial exploratory phase estimates the
reward distribution for each prompt using a small exploration budget, and a
second stage adaptively allocates the remaining budget using these estimates.
Our method is simple, practical, and compatible with any LM/RM combination.
Empirical results on the AlpacaEval dataset for 12 LM/RM pairs and 50 different
batches of prompts show that our adaptive strategy consistently outperforms the
uniform allocation with the same inference budget. Moreover, our experiments
show that our adaptive strategy remains competitive against uniform allocations
with 20% larger inference budgets and even improves in performance as the batch
size grows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across
various tasks but remain vulnerable to meticulously crafted jailbreak attacks.
In this paper, we identify a critical safety gap: while LLMs are adept at
detecting jailbreak prompts, they often produce unsafe responses when directly
processing these inputs. Inspired by this insight, we propose SAGE (Self-Aware
Guard Enhancement), a training-free defense strategy designed to align LLMs'
strong safety discrimination performance with their relatively weaker safety
generation ability. SAGE consists of two core components: a Discriminative
Analysis Module and a Discriminative Response Module, enhancing resilience
against sophisticated jailbreak attempts through flexible safety discrimination
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAGE's effectiveness and
robustness across various open-source and closed-source LLMs of different sizes
and architectures, achieving an average 99% defense success rate against
numerous complex and covert jailbreak methods while maintaining helpfulness on
general benchmarks. We further conduct mechanistic interpretability analysis
through hidden states and attention distributions, revealing the underlying
mechanisms of this detection-generation discrepancy. Our work thus contributes
to developing future LLMs with coherent safety awareness and generation
behavior. Our code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Demonstrations and instructions are two primary approaches for prompting
language models to perform in-context learning (ICL) tasks. Do identical tasks
elicited in different ways result in similar representations of the task? An
improved understanding of task representation mechanisms would offer
interpretability insights and may aid in steering models. We study this through
function vectors, recently proposed as a mechanism to extract few-shot ICL task
representations. We generalize function vectors to alternative task
presentations, focusing on short textual instruction prompts, and successfully
extract instruction function vectors that promote zero-shot task accuracy. We
find evidence that demonstration- and instruction-based function vectors
leverage different model components, and offer several controls to dissociate
their contributions to task performance. Our results suggest that different
task presentations do not induce a common task representation but elicit
different, partly overlapping mechanisms. Our findings offer principled support
to the practice of combining textual instructions and task demonstrations,
imply challenges in universally monitoring task inference across presentation
forms, and encourage further examinations of LLM task inference mechanisms.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising technique for enhancing large
language models, though its application in large-scale pre-training remains
relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation
of model merging techniques during the pre-training process. Through extensive
experiments with both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures ranging
from millions to over 100 billion parameters, we demonstrate that merging
checkpoints trained with constant learning rates not only achieves significant
performance improvements but also enables accurate prediction of annealing
behavior. These improvements lead to both more efficient model development and
significantly lower training costs. Our detailed ablation studies on merging
strategies and hyperparameters provide new insights into the underlying
mechanisms while uncovering novel applications. Through comprehensive
experimental analysis, we offer the open-source community practical
pre-training guidelines for effective model merging.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLM的公平性和可靠性，适用于伦理敏感任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) push the bound-aries in natural language
processing and generative AI, driving progress across various aspects of modern
society. Unfortunately, the pervasive issue of bias in LLMs responses (i.e.,
predictions) poses a significant and open challenge, hindering their
application in tasks involving ethical sensitivity and responsible
decision-making. In this work, we propose a straightforward, user-friendly and
practical method to mitigate such biases, enhancing the reliability and
trustworthiness of LLMs. Our method creates multiple variations of a given
sentence by modifying specific attributes and evaluates the corresponding
prediction behavior compared to the original, unaltered, prediction/sentence.
The idea behind this process is that critical ethical predictions often exhibit
notable inconsistencies, indicating the presence of bias. Unlike previous
approaches, our method relies solely on forward passes (i.e., testing-time
adversaries), eliminating the need for training, fine-tuning, or prior
knowledge of the training data distribution. Through extensive experiments on
the popular Llama family, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
improving various fairness metrics, focusing on the reduction of disparities in
how the model treats individuals from different racial groups. Specifically,
using standard metrics, we improve the fairness in Llama3 in up to 27
percentage points. Overall, our approach significantly enhances fairness,
equity, and reliability in LLM-generated results without parameter tuning or
training data modifications, confirming its effectiveness in practical
scenarios. We believe our work establishes an important step toward enabling
the use of LLMs in tasks that require ethical considerations and responsible
decision-making.

Abstract: The widespread integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
sectors has highlighted the need for empirical research to understand their
biases, thought patterns, and societal implications to ensure ethical and
effective use. In this study, we propose a novel framework for evaluating LLMs,
focusing on uncovering their ideological biases through a quantitative analysis
of 436 binary-choice questions, many of which have no definitive answer. By
applying our framework to ChatGPT and Gemini, findings revealed that while LLMs
generally maintain consistent opinions on many topics, their ideologies differ
across models and languages. Notably, ChatGPT exhibits a tendency to change
their opinion to match the questioner's opinion. Both models also exhibited
problematic biases, unethical or unfair claims, which might have negative
societal impacts. These results underscore the importance of addressing both
ideological and ethical considerations when evaluating LLMs. The proposed
framework offers a flexible, quantitative method for assessing LLM behavior,
providing valuable insights for the development of more socially aligned AI
systems.

Conclusion: 结论指出，LLMs与人类句子处理的偏差可能随模型规模增大而加剧，质疑了LLMs作为人类语言处理模型的适用性。

Abstract: The impressive linguistic abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
recommended them as models of human sentence processing, with some conjecturing
a positive 'quality-power' relationship (Wilcox et al., 2023), in which
language models' (LMs') fit to psychometric data continues to improve as their
ability to predict words in context increases. This is important because it
suggests that elements of LLM architecture, such as veridical attention to
context and a unique objective of predicting upcoming words, reflect the
architecture of the human sentence processing faculty, and that any
inadequacies in predicting human reading time and brain imaging data may be
attributed to insufficient model complexity, which recedes as larger models
become available. Recent studies (Oh and Schuler, 2023) have shown this scaling
inverts after a point, as LMs become excessively large and accurate, when word
prediction probability (as information-theoretic surprisal) is used as a
predictor. Other studies propose the use of entire vectors from differently
sized LLMs, still showing positive scaling (Schrimpf et al., 2021), casting
doubt on the value of surprisal as a predictor, but do not control for the
larger number of predictors in vectors from larger LMs. This study evaluates
LLM scaling using entire LLM vectors, while controlling for the larger number
of predictors in vectors from larger LLMs. Results show that inverse scaling
obtains, suggesting that inadequacies in predicting human reading time and
brain imaging data may be due to substantial misalignment between LLMs and
human sentence processing, which worsens as larger models are used.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a popular evaluation strategy, where advanced
large language models assess generation results in alignment with human
instructions. While these models serve as a promising alternative to human
annotators, their reliability in multilingual evaluation remains uncertain. To
bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multilingual
LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, we evaluate five models from different model
families across five diverse tasks involving 25 languages. Our findings reveal
that LLMs struggle to achieve consistent judgment results across languages,
with an average Fleiss' Kappa of approximately 0.3, and some models performing
even worse. To investigate the cause of inconsistency, we analyze various
influencing factors. We observe that consistency varies significantly across
languages, with particularly poor performance in low-resource languages.
Additionally, we find that neither training on multilingual data nor increasing
model scale directly improves judgment consistency. These findings suggest that
LLMs are not yet reliable for evaluating multilingual predictions. We finally
propose an ensemble strategy which improves the consistency of the multilingual
judge in real-world applications.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on task-specific data is essential
for their effective deployment. As dataset sizes grow, efficiently selecting
optimal subsets for training becomes crucial to balancing performance and
computational costs. Traditional data selection methods often require
fine-tuning a scoring model on the target dataset, which is time-consuming and
resource-intensive, or rely on heuristics that fail to fully leverage the
model's predictive capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Data
Whisperer, an efficient, training-free, attention-based method that leverages
few-shot in-context learning with the model to be fine-tuned. Comprehensive
evaluations were conducted on both raw and synthetic datasets across diverse
tasks and models. Notably, Data Whisperer achieves superior performance
compared to the full GSM8K dataset on the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, using just
10% of the data, and outperforms existing methods with a 3.1-point improvement

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in a
variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, when applied to
long-context scenarios, they face two challenges, i.e., low computational
efficiency and much redundant information. This paper introduces GMSA, a
context compression framework based on the encoder-decoder architecture, which
addresses these challenges by reducing input sequence length and redundant
information. Structurally, GMSA has two key components: Group Merging and Layer
Semantic Alignment (LSA). Group merging is used to effectively and efficiently
extract summary vectors from the original context. Layer semantic alignment, on
the other hand, aligns the high-level summary vectors with the low-level
primary input semantics, thus bridging the semantic gap between different
layers. In the training process, GMSA first learns soft tokens that contain
complete semantics through autoencoder training. To furtherly adapt GMSA to
downstream tasks, we propose Knowledge Extraction Fine-tuning (KEFT) to extract
knowledge from the soft tokens for downstream tasks. We train GMSA by randomly
sampling the compression rate for each sample in the dataset. Under this
condition, GMSA not only significantly outperforms the traditional compression
paradigm in context restoration but also achieves stable and significantly
faster convergence with only a few encoder layers. In downstream
question-answering (QA) tasks, GMSA can achieve approximately a 2x speedup in
end-to-end inference while outperforming both the original input prompts and
various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a large margin.

Result: 实验表明，UniCuCo在处理64个请求时比基线方法快28倍，同时保持与基线相当的准确性。

Conclusion: UniCuCo为多请求剪枝任务提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing pruning methods for large language models (LLMs) focus on achieving
high compression rates while maintaining model performance. Although these
methods have demonstrated satisfactory performance in handling a single user's
compression request, their processing time increases linearly with the number
of requests, making them inefficient for real-world scenarios with multiple
simultaneous requests. To address this limitation, we propose a Univeral Model
for Customized Compression (UniCuCo) for LLMs, which introduces a StratNet that
learns to map arbitrary requests to their optimal pruning strategy. The
challenge in training StratNet lies in the high computational cost of
evaluating pruning strategies and the non-differentiable nature of the pruning
process, which hinders gradient backpropagation for StratNet updates. To
overcome these challenges, we leverage a Gaussian process to approximate the
evaluation process. Since the gradient of the Gaussian process is computable,
we can use it to approximate the gradient of the non-differentiable pruning
process, thereby enabling StratNet updates. Experimental results show that
UniCuCo is 28 times faster than baselines in processing 64 requests, while
maintaining comparable accuracy to baselines.

Abstract: The memorization of sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII)
by large language models (LLMs) poses growing privacy risks as models scale and
are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Existing efforts to study
sensitive and PII data memorization and develop mitigation strategies are
hampered by the absence of comprehensive, realistic, and ethically sourced
datasets reflecting the diversity of sensitive information found on the web. We
introduce PANORAMA - Profile-based Assemblage for Naturalistic Online
Representation and Attribute Memorization Analysis, a large-scale synthetic
corpus of 384,789 samples derived from 9,674 synthetic profiles designed to
closely emulate the distribution, variety, and context of PII and sensitive
data as it naturally occurs in online environments. Our data generation
pipeline begins with the construction of internally consistent, multi-attribute
human profiles using constrained selection to reflect real-world demographics
such as education, health attributes, financial status, etc. Using a
combination of zero-shot prompting and OpenAI o3-mini, we generate diverse
content types - including wiki-style articles, social media posts, forum
discussions, online reviews, comments, and marketplace listings - each
embedding realistic, contextually appropriate PII and other sensitive
information. We validate the utility of PANORAMA by fine-tuning the Mistral-7B
model on 1x, 5x, 10x, and 25x data replication rates with a subset of data and
measure PII memorization rates - revealing not only consistent increases with
repetition but also variation across content types, highlighting PANORAMA's
ability to model how memorization risks differ by context. Our dataset and code
are publicly available, providing a much-needed resource for privacy risk
assessment, model auditing, and the development of privacy-preserving LLMs.

Abstract: Autoregressive neural language models (LMs) generate a probability
distribution over tokens at each time step given a prompt. In this work, we
attempt to systematically understand the probability distributions that LMs can
produce, showing that some distributions are significantly harder to elicit
than others. Specifically, for any target next-token distribution over the
vocabulary, we attempt to find a prompt that induces the LM to output a
distribution as close as possible to the target, using either soft or hard
gradient-based prompt tuning. We find that (1) in general, distributions with
very low or very high entropy are easier to approximate than those with
moderate entropy; (2) among distributions with the same entropy, those
containing ''outlier tokens'' are easier to approximate; (3) target
distributions generated by LMs -- even LMs with different tokenizers -- are
easier to approximate than randomly chosen targets. These results offer
insights into the expressiveness of LMs and the challenges of using them as
probability distribution proposers.

Conclusion: EQUAL为指令调优提供了一种高效且可扩展的数据提取方法。

Abstract: Instruction tuning improves the performance of large language models (LLMs),
but it heavily relies on high-quality training data. Recently, LLMs have been
used to synthesize instruction data using seed question-answer (QA) pairs.
However, these synthesized instructions often lack diversity and tend to be
similar to the input seeds, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address this, we propose extracting instruction tuning data from
web corpora that contain rich and diverse knowledge. A naive solution is to
retrieve domain-specific documents and extract all QA pairs from them, but this
faces two key challenges: (1) extracting all QA pairs using LLMs is
prohibitively expensive, and (2) many extracted QA pairs may be irrelevant to
the downstream tasks, potentially degrading model performance. To tackle these
issues, we introduce EQUAL, an effective and scalable data extraction framework
that iteratively alternates between document selection and high-quality QA pair
extraction to enhance instruction tuning. EQUAL first clusters the document
corpus based on embeddings derived from contrastive learning, then uses a
multi-armed bandit strategy to efficiently identify clusters that are likely to
contain valuable QA pairs. This iterative approach significantly reduces
computational cost while boosting model performance. Experiments on
AutoMathText and StackOverflow across four downstream tasks show that EQUAL
reduces computational costs by 5-10x and improves accuracy by 2.5 percent on
LLaMA-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the development
of effective evaluation methods. Traditional benchmarks rely on task-specific
metrics and static datasets, which often suffer from fairness issues, limited
scalability, and contamination risks. In this paper, we introduce Teach2Eval,
an indirect evaluation framework inspired by the Feynman Technique. Instead of
directly testing LLMs on predefined tasks, our method evaluates a model's
multiple abilities to teach weaker student models to perform tasks effectively.
By converting open-ended tasks into standardized multiple-choice questions
(MCQs) through teacher-generated feedback, Teach2Eval enables scalable,
automated, and multi-dimensional assessment. Our approach not only avoids data
leakage and memorization but also captures a broad range of cognitive abilities
that are orthogonal to current benchmarks. Experimental results across 26
leading LLMs show strong alignment with existing human and model-based dynamic
rankings, while offering additional interpretability for training guidance.

Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of factually incorrect information, remains a
significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), especially in

hallucination in long-form tasks either focus on limited domains or rely
heavily on external fact-checking tools, which may not always be available.
  In this work, we systematically investigate reference-free hallucination
detection in open-domain long-form responses. Our findings reveal that internal
states (e.g., model's output probability and entropy) alone are insufficient
for reliably (i.e., better than random guessing) distinguishing between factual
and hallucinated content. To enhance detection, we explore various existing
approaches, including prompting-based methods, probing, and fine-tuning, with
fine-tuning proving the most effective. To further improve the accuracy, we
introduce a new paradigm, named RATE-FT, that augments fine-tuning with an
auxiliary task for the model to jointly learn with the main task of
hallucination detection. With extensive experiments and analysis using a
variety of model families & datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method, e.g., +3% over general fine-tuning methods on

Abstract: Understanding which neural components drive specific capabilities in

introduce the $(\bm{K}, \epsilon)$-Minimum Sufficient Head Circuit ($K$-MSHC),
a methodology to identify minimal sets of attention heads crucial for
classification tasks as well as Search-K-MSHC, an efficient algorithm for
discovering these circuits. Applying our Search-K-MSHC algorithm to Gemma-9B,
we analyze three syntactic task families: grammar acceptability, arithmetic
verification, and arithmetic word problems. Our findings reveal distinct
task-specific head circuits, with grammar tasks predominantly utilizing early
layers, word problems showing pronounced activity in both shallow and deep
regions, and arithmetic verification demonstrating a more distributed pattern
across the network. We discover non-linear circuit overlap patterns, where
different task pairs share computational components at varying levels of
importance. While grammar and arithmetic share many "weak" heads, arithmetic
and word problems share more consistently critical "strong" heads. Importantly,
we find that each task maintains dedicated "super-heads" with minimal
cross-task overlap, suggesting that syntactic and numerical competencies emerge
from specialized yet partially reusable head circuits.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread applications across various
domains, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial prompt injections. While most
existing research on jailbreak attacks and hallucination phenomena has focused
primarily on open-source models, we investigate the frontier of closed-source
LLMs under multilingual attack scenarios. We present a first-of-its-kind
integrated adversarial framework that leverages diverse attack techniques to
systematically evaluate frontier proprietary solutions, including GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-R1, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and Qwen-Max. Our evaluation spans six categories
of security contents in both English and Chinese, generating 38,400 responses
across 32 types of jailbreak attacks. Attack success rate (ASR) is utilized as
the quantitative metric to assess performance from three dimensions: prompt
design, model architecture, and language environment. Our findings suggest that
Qwen-Max is the most vulnerable, while GPT-4o shows the strongest defense.
Notably, prompts in Chinese consistently yield higher ASRs than their English
counterparts, and our novel Two-Sides attack technique proves to be the most
effective across all models. This work highlights a dire need for
language-aware alignment and robust cross-lingual defenses in LLMs, and we hope
it will inspire researchers, developers, and policymakers toward more robust
and inclusive AI systems.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs), their knowledge
memorization capabilities remain underexplored, due to the lack of standardized
and high-quality test ground. In this paper, we introduce a novel, real-world
and large-scale knowledge injection benchmark that evolves continuously over
time without requiring human intervention. Specifically, we propose WikiDYK,
which leverages recently-added and human-written facts from Wikipedia's "Did
You Know..." entries. These entries are carefully selected by expert Wikipedia
editors based on criteria such as verifiability and clarity. Each entry is
converted into multiple question-answer pairs spanning diverse task formats
from easy cloze prompts to complex multi-hop questions. WikiDYK contains 12,290
facts and 77,180 questions, which is also seamlessly extensible with future
updates from Wikipedia editors. Extensive experiments using continued
pre-training reveal a surprising insight: despite their prevalence in modern
LLMs, Causal Language Models (CLMs) demonstrate significantly weaker knowledge
memorization capabilities compared to Bidirectional Language Models (BiLMs),
exhibiting a 23% lower accuracy in terms of reliability. To compensate for the
smaller scales of current BiLMs, we introduce a modular collaborative framework
utilizing ensembles of BiLMs as external knowledge repositories to integrate
with LLMs. Experiment shows that our framework further improves the reliability
accuracy by up to 29.1%.

Result: 在15个基准测试中，ExpertSteer显著优于基线方法，效果显著且成本低。

Conclusion: ExpertSteer为LLMs的行为控制提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across various
tasks, yet guiding them to follow desired behaviours during inference remains a
significant challenge. Activation steering offers a promising method to control
the generation process of LLMs by modifying their internal activations.
However, existing methods commonly intervene in the model's behaviour using
steering vectors generated by the model itself, which constrains their
effectiveness to that specific model and excludes the possibility of leveraging
powerful external expert models for steering. To address these limitations, we
propose ExpertSteer, a novel approach that leverages arbitrary specialized
expert models to generate steering vectors, enabling intervention in any LLMs.
ExpertSteer transfers the knowledge from an expert model to a target LLM
through a cohesive four-step process: first aligning representation dimensions
with auto-encoders to enable cross-model transfer, then identifying
intervention layer pairs based on mutual information analysis, next generating
steering vectors from the expert model using Recursive Feature Machines, and
finally applying these vectors on the identified layers during inference to
selectively guide the target LLM without updating model parameters. We conduct
comprehensive experiments using three LLMs on 15 popular benchmarks across four
distinct domains. Experiments demonstrate that ExpertSteer significantly
outperforms established baselines across diverse tasks at minimal cost.

Abstract: Model editing aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large language
models (LLMs) by efficiently adjusting their internal parameters. Currently,
most LLM editing datasets are confined to narrow knowledge domains and cover a
limited range of editing evaluation. They often overlook the broad scope of
editing demands and the diversity of ripple effects resulting from edits. In
this context, we introduce UniEdit, a unified benchmark for LLM editing
grounded in open-domain knowledge. First, we construct editing samples by
selecting entities from 25 common domains across five major categories,
utilizing the extensive triple knowledge available in open-domain knowledge
graphs to ensure comprehensive coverage of the knowledge domains. To address
the issues of generality and locality in editing, we design an Neighborhood
Multi-hop Chain Sampling (NMCS) algorithm to sample subgraphs based on a given
knowledge piece to entail comprehensive ripple effects to evaluate. Finally, we
employ proprietary LLMs to convert the sampled knowledge subgraphs into natural
language text, guaranteeing grammatical accuracy and syntactical diversity.
Extensive statistical analysis confirms the scale, comprehensiveness, and
diversity of our UniEdit benchmark. We conduct comprehensive experiments across
multiple LLMs and editors, analyzing their performance to highlight strengths
and weaknesses in editing across open knowledge domains and various evaluation
criteria, thereby offering valuable insights for future research endeavors.

Abstract: Despite their performance, large language models (LLMs) can inadvertently
perpetuate biases found in the data they are trained on. By analyzing LLM
responses to bias-eliciting headlines, we find that these models often mirror
human biases. To address this, we explore crowd-based strategies for mitigating
bias through response aggregation. We first demonstrate that simply averaging
responses from multiple LLMs, intended to leverage the "wisdom of the crowd",
can exacerbate existing biases due to the limited diversity within LLM crowds.
In contrast, we show that locally weighted aggregation methods more effectively
leverage the wisdom of the LLM crowd, achieving both bias mitigation and
improved accuracy. Finally, recognizing the complementary strengths of LLMs
(accuracy) and humans (diversity), we demonstrate that hybrid crowds containing
both significantly enhance performance and further reduce biases across ethnic

Conclusion: 需从数据和模型两个维度追溯偏见起源，采取整体方法以减少危害。

Abstract: Current research on bias in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
data quality, with significantly less attention paid to model architecture and
temporal influences of data. Even more critically, few studies systematically
investigate the origins of bias. We propose a methodology grounded in
comparative behavioral theory to interpret the complex interaction between
training data and model architecture in bias propagation during language
modeling. Building on recent work that relates transformers to n-gram LMs, we
evaluate how data, model design choices, and temporal dynamics affect bias
propagation. Our findings reveal that: (1) n-gram LMs are highly sensitive to
context window size in bias propagation, while transformers demonstrate
architectural robustness; (2) the temporal provenance of training data
significantly affects bias; and (3) different model architectures respond
differentially to controlled bias injection, with certain biases (e.g. sexual
orientation) being disproportionately amplified. As language models become
ubiquitous, our findings highlight the need for a holistic approach -- tracing
bias to its origins across both data and model dimensions, not just symptoms,
to mitigate harm.

Result: 实验表明，SLOT在多个基准测试和LLMs中表现优异，例如Qwen2.5-7B在GSM8K上准确率提升8.6%，DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B在GPQA上达到68.69%的SOTA准确率。

Conclusion: SLOT通过测试时优化显著提升了语言模型对复杂指令的响应能力，且具有参数高效性。

Abstract: We propose SLOT (Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time), a
novel and parameter-efficient test-time inference approach that enhances a
language model's ability to more accurately respond to individual prompts.
Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex instructions,
leading to poor performances on those not well represented among general
samples. To address this, SLOT conducts few optimization steps at test-time to
update a light-weight sample-specific parameter vector. It is added to the
final hidden layer before the output head, and enables efficient adaptation by
caching the last layer features during per-sample optimization. By minimizing
the cross-entropy loss on the input prompt only, SLOT helps the model better
aligned with and follow each given instruction. In experiments, we demonstrate
that our method outperforms the compared models across multiple benchmarks and
LLMs. For example, Qwen2.5-7B with SLOT achieves an accuracy gain of 8.6% on
GSM8K from 57.54% to 66.19%, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B with SLOT

Conclusion: Traversal Verification在保证无损推理的同时，实现了显著的加速效果。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a promising approach for accelerating large language
models. The primary idea is to use a lightweight draft model to speculate the
output of the target model for multiple subsequent timesteps, and then verify
them in parallel to determine whether the drafted tokens should be accepted or
rejected. To enhance acceptance rates, existing frameworks typically construct
token trees containing multiple candidates in each timestep. However, their
reliance on token-level verification mechanisms introduces two critical
limitations: First, the probability distribution of a sequence differs from
that of individual tokens, leading to suboptimal acceptance length. Second,
current verification schemes begin from the root node and proceed layer by
layer in a top-down manner. Once a parent node is rejected, all its child nodes
should be discarded, resulting in inefficient utilization of speculative
candidates. This paper introduces Traversal Verification, a novel speculative
decoding algorithm that fundamentally rethinks the verification paradigm
through leaf-to-root traversal. Our approach considers the acceptance of the
entire token sequence from the current node to the root, and preserves
potentially valid subsequences that would be prematurely discarded by existing
methods. We theoretically prove that the probability distribution obtained
through Traversal Verification is identical to that of the target model,
guaranteeing lossless inference while achieving substantial acceleration gains.
Experimental results across different large language models and multiple tasks
show that our method consistently improves acceptance length and throughput
over existing methods

Result: PSC显著降低了困惑度（perplexity），尤其在16k至64k的上下文窗口范围内，且具有广泛的适用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PSC是一种简单有效的频率校准方法，能显著提升RoPE在长上下文任务中的表现。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is an efficient position encoding approach
and is widely utilized in numerous large language models (LLMs). Recently, a
lot of methods have been put forward to further expand the context window based
on RoPE. The core concept of those methods is to predefine or search for a set
of factors to rescale the base frequencies of RoPE. Nevertheless, it is quite a
challenge for existing methods to predefine an optimal factor due to the
exponential search space. In view of this, we introduce PSC (Phase Shift
Calibration), a small module for calibrating the frequencies predefined by
existing methods. With the employment of PSC, we demonstrate that many existing
methods can be further enhanced, like PI, YaRN, and LongRoPE. We conducted
extensive experiments across multiple models and tasks. The results demonstrate
that (1) when PSC is enabled, the comparative reductions in perplexity increase
as the context window size is varied from 16k, to 32k, and up to 64k. (2) Our
approach is broadly applicable and exhibits robustness across a variety of
models and tasks. The code can be found at https://github.com/WNQzhu/PSC.

Conclusion: 自问自答是一种实用机制，可自动提升LLM理解能力，并作为诊断工具揭示内部与外部知识的组织方式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly demonstrate signs of conceptual
understanding, yet much of their internal knowledge remains latent, loosely
structured, and difficult to access or evaluate. We propose self-questioning as
a lightweight and scalable strategy to improve LLMs' understanding,
particularly in domains where success depends on fine-grained semantic
distinctions. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a challenging new
benchmark of 1.3 million post-2015 computer science patent pairs, characterized
by dense technical jargon and strategically complex writing. The benchmark
centers on a pairwise differentiation task: can a model distinguish between
closely related but substantively different inventions? We show that prompting
LLMs to generate and answer their own questions - targeting the background
knowledge required for the task - significantly improves performance. These
self-generated questions and answers activate otherwise underutilized internal
knowledge. Allowing LLMs to retrieve answers from external scientific texts
further enhances performance, suggesting that model knowledge is compressed and
lacks the full richness of the training data. We also find that
chain-of-thought prompting and self-questioning converge, though
self-questioning remains more effective for improving understanding of
technical concepts. Notably, we uncover an asymmetry in prompting: smaller
models often generate more fundamental, more open-ended, better-aligned
questions for mid-sized models than large models with better understanding do,
revealing a new strategy for cross-model collaboration. Altogether, our
findings establish self-questioning as both a practical mechanism for
automatically improving LLM comprehension, especially in domains with sparse
and underrepresented knowledge, and a diagnostic probe of how internal and
external knowledge are organized.

Abstract: The increasing context length of modern language models has created a need

leveraging structured representations of financial agreements (3) along three
key dimensions -- multi-hop retrieval, set operations, and answer plurality --
enabling fine-grained assessment of model performance across controlled
difficulty levels. Using this framework, we construct a dataset of 20,139 QA

Abstract: Ambiguity remains a fundamental challenge in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) due to the inherent complexity and flexibility of human language. With
the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing ambiguity has become
even more critical due to their expanded capabilities and applications. In the
context of Conversational Question Answering (CQA), this paper explores the
definition, forms, and implications of ambiguity for language driven systems,
particularly in the context of LLMs. We define key terms and concepts,
categorize various disambiguation approaches enabled by LLMs, and provide a
comparative analysis of their advantages and disadvantages. We also explore
publicly available datasets for benchmarking ambiguity detection and resolution
techniques and highlight their relevance for ongoing research. Finally, we
identify open problems and future research directions, proposing areas for
further investigation. By offering a comprehensive review of current research
on ambiguities and disambiguation with LLMs, we aim to contribute to the
development of more robust and reliable language systems.

Result: 实验表明，两阶段分层大纲方法显著减少了语义失真，优于单阶段方法。

Conclusion: 研究为作者和研究人员提供了实证指导，帮助优化LLM在百万字小说生成中的表现。

Abstract: Writing novels with Large Language Models (LLMs) raises a critical question:
how much human-authored outline is necessary to generate high-quality
million-word novels? While frameworks such as DOME, Plan&Write, and Long Writer
have improved stylistic coherence and logical consistency, they primarily
target shorter novels (10k--100k words), leaving ultra-long generation largely
unexplored. Drawing on insights from recent text compression methods like
LLMZip and LLM2Vec, we conduct an information-theoretic analysis that
quantifies distortion occurring when LLMs compress and reconstruct ultra-long
novels under varying compression-expansion ratios. We introduce a hierarchical
two-stage generation pipeline (outline -> detailed outline -> manuscript) and
find an optimal outline length that balances information preservation with
human effort. Through extensive experimentation with Chinese novels, we
establish that a two-stage hierarchical outline approach significantly reduces
semantic distortion compared to single-stage methods. Our findings provide
empirically-grounded guidance for authors and researchers collaborating with
LLMs to create million-word novels.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMS) process
non-English tokens within their layer representations, an open question despite
significant advancements in the field. Using representation steering,
specifically by adding a learned vector to a single model layer's activations,
we demonstrate that steering a single model layer can notably enhance
performance. Our analysis shows that this approach achieves results comparable
to translation baselines and surpasses state of the art prompt optimization
methods. Additionally, we highlight how advanced techniques like supervised
fine tuning (\textsc{sft}) and reinforcement learning from human feedback
(\textsc{rlhf}) improve multilingual capabilities by altering representation
spaces. We further illustrate how these methods align with our approach to
reshaping LLMS layer representations.

Abstract: Prompts are the interface for eliciting the capabilities of large language

analyzing LLM behavior and optimizing performance. However, the field lacks a
comprehensive framework for systematic prompt analysis and understanding. We
introduce PromptPrism, a linguistically-inspired taxonomy that enables prompt
analysis across three hierarchical levels: functional structure, semantic
component, and syntactic pattern. We show the practical utility of PromptPrism
by applying it to three applications: (1) a taxonomy-guided prompt refinement
approach that automatically improves prompt quality and enhances model
performance across a range of tasks; (2) a multi-dimensional dataset profiling
method that extracts and aggregates structural, semantic, and syntactic
characteristics from prompt datasets, enabling comprehensive analysis of prompt
distributions and patterns; (3) a controlled experimental framework for prompt
sensitivity analysis by quantifying the impact of semantic reordering and
delimiter modifications on LLM performance. Our experimental results validate
the effectiveness of our taxonomy across these applications, demonstrating that
PromptPrism provides a foundation for refining, profiling, and analyzing
prompts.

Result: 结果表明分类器适合此任务，并提供了HAGRID数据集的清洁版本和端到端归属系统。

Conclusion: 预归属步骤能有效提升LLM输出的可验证性和可信度，适用于科学和高风险场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various science
domains, yet their broader adoption remains constrained by a critical
challenge: the lack of trustworthy, verifiable outputs. Current LLMs often
generate answers without reliable source attribution, or worse, with incorrect
attributions, posing a barrier to their use in scientific and high-stakes
settings, where traceability and accountability are non-negotiable. To be
reliable, attribution systems need high accuracy and retrieve data with short
lengths, i.e., attribute to a sentence within a document rather than a whole
document. We propose a sentence-level pre-attribution step for
Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that classify sentences into three
categories: not attributable, attributable to a single quote, and attributable
to multiple quotes. By separating sentences before attribution, a proper
attribution method can be selected for the type of sentence, or the attribution
can be skipped altogether. Our results indicate that classifiers are
well-suited for this task. In this work, we propose a pre-attribution step to
reduce the computational complexity of attribution, provide a clean version of
the HAGRID dataset, and provide an end-to-end attribution system that works out
of the box.

Abstract: DeepSeek recently released R1, a high-performing large language model (LLM)
optimized for reasoning tasks. Despite its efficient training pipeline, R1
achieves competitive performance, even surpassing leading reasoning models like
OpenAI's o1 on several benchmarks. However, emerging reports suggest that R1
refuses to answer certain prompts related to politically sensitive topics in
China. While existing LLMs often implement safeguards to avoid generating
harmful or offensive outputs, R1 represents a notable shift - exhibiting
censorship-like behavior on politically charged queries. In this paper, we
investigate this phenomenon by first introducing a large-scale set of heavily
curated prompts that get censored by R1, covering a range of politically
sensitive topics, but are not censored by other models. We then conduct a
comprehensive analysis of R1's censorship patterns, examining their
consistency, triggers, and variations across topics, prompt phrasing, and
context. Beyond English-language queries, we explore censorship behavior in
other languages. We also investigate the transferability of censorship to
models distilled from the R1 language model. Finally, we propose techniques for
bypassing or removing this censorship. Our findings reveal possible additional
censorship integration likely shaped by design choices during training or
alignment, raising concerns about transparency, bias, and governance in
language model deployment.

Abstract: Knowledge editing, which aims to update the knowledge encoded in language
models, can be deceptive. Despite the fact that many existing knowledge editing
algorithms achieve near-perfect performance on conventional metrics, the models
edited by them are still prone to generating original knowledge. This paper
introduces the concept of "superficial editing" to describe this phenomenon.
Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that this issue presents a significant
challenge to existing algorithms. Through systematic investigation, we identify
and validate two key factors contributing to this issue: (1) the residual
stream at the last subject position in earlier layers and (2) specific
attention modules in later layers. Notably, certain attention heads in later
layers, along with specific left singular vectors in their output matrices,
encapsulate the original knowledge and exhibit a causal relationship with
superficial editing. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the task of
superficial unlearning, where we observe consistent patterns in the behavior of
specific attention heads and their corresponding left singular vectors, thereby
demonstrating the robustness and broader applicability of our methodology and
conclusions. Our code is available here.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to impressive
progress in natural language generation, yet their tendency to produce
hallucinated or unsubstantiated content remains a critical concern. To improve
factual reliability, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external
knowledge during inference. However, existing RAG systems face two major
limitations: (1) unreliable adaptive control due to limited external knowledge
supervision, and (2) hallucinations caused by inaccurate or irrelevant
references. To address these issues, we propose Know3-RAG, a knowledge-aware
RAG framework that leverages structured knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs)
to guide three core stages of the RAG process, including retrieval, generation,
and filtering. Specifically, we introduce a knowledge-aware adaptive retrieval
module that employs KG embedding to assess the confidence of the generated
answer and determine retrieval necessity, a knowledge-enhanced reference
generation strategy that enriches queries with KG-derived entities to improve
generated reference relevance, and a knowledge-driven reference filtering
mechanism that ensures semantic alignment and factual accuracy of references.
Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks demonstrate that Know3-RAG
consistently outperforms strong baselines, significantly reducing
hallucinations and enhancing answer reliability.

Result: 在19个基准测试中，Shadow-FT优于传统全参数和参数高效微调方法。

Conclusion: Shadow-FT高效且通用，适用于多模态大模型和DPO。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) consistently benefit from further fine-tuning on
various tasks. However, we observe that directly tuning the INSTRUCT (i.e.,
instruction tuned) models often leads to marginal improvements and even
performance degeneration. Notably, paired BASE models, the foundation for these
INSTRUCT variants, contain highly similar weight values (i.e., less than 2% on
average for Llama 3.1 8B). Therefore, we propose a novel Shadow-FT framework to
tune the INSTRUCT models by leveraging the corresponding BASE models. The key
insight is to fine-tune the BASE model, and then directly graft the learned
weight updates to the INSTRUCT model. Our proposed Shadow-FT introduces no
additional parameters, is easy to implement, and significantly improves
performance. We conduct extensive experiments on tuning mainstream LLMs, such
as Qwen 3 and Llama 3 series, and evaluate them across 19 benchmarks covering
coding, reasoning, and mathematical tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that Shadow-FT consistently outperforms conventional full-parameter and
parameter-efficient tuning approaches. Further analyses indicate that Shadow-FT
can be applied to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and combined with
direct preference optimization (DPO). Codes and weights are available at

Conclusion: 通过代码翻译和OORL框架，LLMs能更好地理解代码功能及跨语言关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in code
generation tasks. However, a significant performance disparity persists between
popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this
capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby
facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming
languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies.
Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a
rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this
coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference
Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO
trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be
guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones,
while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within
the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code
functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs
improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the
relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation
tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across
multiple programming languages.

Motivation: Existing methods treat execution feedback as post-hoc signals, limiting their ability to correct reasoning errors dynamically during generation.

Method: ReEx-SQL interleaves intermediate SQL execution into reasoning paths, uses structured prompts, a stepwise rollout strategy, and a composite reward function for reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves 88.8% on Spider and 64.9% on BIRD, surpassing baselines by 2.7% and 2.6%, respectively, with improved efficiency (51.9% faster inference).

Conclusion: ReEx-SQL demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating execution feedback dynamically, enhancing both performance and robustness in Text-to-SQL tasks.

Abstract: In Text-to-SQL, execution feedback is essential for guiding large language
models (LLMs) to reason accurately and generate reliable SQL queries. However,
existing methods treat execution feedback solely as a post-hoc signal for
correction or selection, failing to integrate it into the generation process.
This limitation hinders their ability to address reasoning errors as they
occur, ultimately reducing query accuracy and robustness. To address this
issue, we propose ReEx-SQL (Reasoning with Execution-Aware Reinforcement
Learning), a framework for Text-to-SQL that enables models to interact with the
database during decoding and dynamically adjust their reasoning based on
execution feedback. ReEx-SQL introduces an execution-aware reasoning paradigm
that interleaves intermediate SQL execution into reasoning paths, facilitating
context-sensitive revisions. It achieves this through structured prompts with
markup tags and a stepwise rollout strategy that integrates execution feedback
into each stage of generation. To supervise policy learning, we develop a
composite reward function that includes an exploration reward, explicitly
encouraging effective database interaction. Additionally, ReEx-SQL adopts a
tree-based decoding strategy to support exploratory reasoning, enabling dynamic
expansion of alternative reasoning paths. Notably, ReEx-SQL achieves 88.8% on
Spider and 64.9% on BIRD at the 7B scale, surpassing the standard reasoning
baseline by 2.7% and 2.6%, respectively. It also shows robustness, achieving
85.2% on Spider-Realistic with leading performance. In addition, its
tree-structured decoding improves efficiency and performance over linear
decoding, reducing inference time by 51.9% on the BIRD development set.

Abstract: Training high-performing Small Language Models (SLMs) remains costly, even
with knowledge distillation and pruning from larger teacher models. Existing
work often faces three key challenges: (1) information loss from hard pruning,
(2) inefficient alignment of representations, and (3) underutilization of
informative activations, particularly from Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). To
address these challenges, we introduce Low-Rank Clone (LRC), an efficient
pre-training method that constructs SLMs aspiring to behavioral equivalence
with strong teacher models. LRC trains a set of low-rank projection matrices
that jointly enable soft pruning by compressing teacher weights, and activation
clone by aligning student activations, including FFN signals, with those of the
teacher. This unified design maximizes knowledge transfer while removing the
need for explicit alignment modules. Extensive experiments with open-source
teachers (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-3B/7B-Instruct) show that LRC
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models trained on trillions of
tokens--while using only 20B tokens, achieving over 1,000x training efficiency.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
various fields, including the identification and discovery of human values
within text data. While traditional NLP models, such as BERT, have been
employed for this task, their ability to represent textual data is
significantly outperformed by emerging LLMs like GPTs. However, the performance
of online LLMs often degrades when handling long contexts required for value
identification, which also incurs substantial computational costs. To address
these challenges, we propose EAVIT, an efficient and accurate framework for
human value identification that combines the strengths of both locally
fine-tunable and online black-box LLMs. Our framework employs a value detector
- a small, local language model - to generate initial value estimations. These
estimations are then used to construct concise input prompts for online LLMs,
enabling accurate final value identification. To train the value detector, we
introduce explanation-based training and data generation techniques
specifically tailored for value identification, alongside sampling strategies
to optimize the brevity of LLM input prompts. Our approach effectively reduces
the number of input tokens by up to 1/6 compared to directly querying online
LLMs, while consistently outperforming traditional NLP methods and other
LLM-based strategies.

Conclusion: PsyMem框架显著提升了角色扮演LLM的可靠性和表现，适用于可信社交模拟等场景。

Abstract: Existing LLM-based role-playing methods often rely on superficial textual
descriptions or simplistic metrics, inadequately modeling both intrinsic and
extrinsic character dimensions. Additionally, they typically simulate character
memory with implicit model knowledge or basic retrieval augment generation
without explicit memory alignment, compromising memory consistency. The two
issues weaken reliability of role-playing LLMs in several applications, such as
trustworthy social simulation. To address these limitations, we propose PsyMem,
a novel framework integrating fine-grained psychological attributes and
explicit memory control for role-playing. PsyMem supplements textual
descriptions with 26 psychological indicators to detailed model character.
Additionally, PsyMem implements memory alignment training, explicitly trains
the model to align character's response with memory, thereby enabling dynamic
memory-controlled responding during inference. By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
on our specially designed dataset (including 5,414 characters and 38,962

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as dominant forces for textual
style transfer. However, for arbitrary style transfer, LLMs face two key
challenges: (1) considerable reliance on manually-constructed prompts and (2)
rigid stylistic biases inherent in LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel
Synthesize-then-Decode (SynDec) approach, which automatically synthesizes
high-quality prompts and amplifies their roles during decoding process.
Specifically, our approach synthesizes prompts by selecting representative
few-shot samples, conducting a four-dimensional style analysis, and reranking
the candidates. At LLM decoding stage, the TST effect is amplified by
maximizing the contrast in output probabilities between scenarios with and
without the synthesized prompt, as well as between prompts and negative
samples. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show that SynDec
outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on five out of six
benchmarks (e.g., achieving up to a 9\% increase in accuracy for
modern-to-Elizabethan English transfer). Detailed ablation studies further

Abstract: Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a
practical direction, as it requires neither additional data nor fine-tuning.
Previous studies usually focus on prompt engineering to guide LLMs to encode
the core semantic information of the sentence into the embedding of the last
token. However, the last token in these methods still encodes an excess of
non-essential information, such as stop words, limiting its encoding capacity.
To this end, we propose a Contrastive Prompting (CP) method that introduces an
extra auxiliary prompt to elicit better sentence embedding. By contrasting with
the auxiliary prompt, CP can steer existing prompts to encode the core
semantics of the sentence, rather than non-essential information. CP is a
plug-and-play inference-time intervention method that can be combined with
various prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments on Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our
method can improve the performance of existing prompt-based methods across
different LLMs. Our code will be released at https://github.com/zifengcheng/CP.

Conclusion: LoT是一种简单有效的技术，能够改善LLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: System 2 reasoning is one of the defining characteristics of intelligence,
which requires slow and logical thinking. Human conducts System 2 reasoning via
the language of thoughts that organizes the reasoning process as a causal
sequence of mental language, or thoughts. Recently, it has been observed that
System 2 reasoning can be elicited from Large Language Models (LLMs)
pre-trained on large-scale natural languages. However, in this work, we show
that there is a significant gap between the modeling of languages and thoughts.
As language is primarily a tool for humans to share knowledge and thinking,
modeling human language can easily absorb language biases into LLMs deviated
from the chain of thoughts in minds. Furthermore, we show that the biases will
mislead the eliciting of "thoughts" in LLMs to focus only on a biased part of
the premise. To this end, we propose a new prompt technique termed
Language-of-Thoughts (LoT) to demonstrate and alleviate this gap. Instead of
directly eliciting the chain of thoughts from partial information, LoT
instructs LLMs to adjust the order and token used for the expressions of all
the relevant information. We show that the simple strategy significantly
reduces the language modeling biases in LLMs and improves the performance of
LLMs across a variety of reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 新方法有效平衡梯度更新，提升RL训练效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with recent innovations
such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) demonstrating exceptional
effectiveness. In this study, we identify a critical yet underexplored issue in
RL training: low-probability tokens disproportionately influence model updates
due to their large gradient magnitudes. This dominance hinders the effective
learning of high-probability tokens, whose gradients are essential for LLMs'
performance but are substantially suppressed. To mitigate this interference, we
propose two novel methods: Advantage Reweighting and Low-Probability Token
Isolation (Lopti), both of which effectively attenuate gradients from
low-probability tokens while emphasizing parameter updates driven by
high-probability tokens. Our approaches promote balanced updates across tokens
with varying probabilities, thereby enhancing the efficiency of RL training.
Experimental results demonstrate that they substantially improve the
performance of GRPO-trained LLMs, achieving up to a 46.2% improvement in K&K
Logic Puzzle reasoning tasks. Our implementation is available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有低秩近似方法未考虑Transformer架构特性，且分解后的小矩阵引入运行时开销，导致性能不如其他压缩技术。

Method: A³将Transformer层分为QK、OV和MLP三个功能组件，为每个组件提供分析解以减少隐藏维度大小，同时最小化功能损失。

Result: 在相同计算和内存减少预算下，A³压缩的LLaMA 3.1-70B在WikiText-2上的困惑度为4.69，优于之前SoTA的7.87。

Conclusion: A³不仅减少了模型大小和计算开销，还提供了从单层损失优化到端到端性能改进的新思路。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance; however,
their massive parameter counts make deployment highly expensive. Low-rank
approximation offers a promising compression solution, yet existing approaches
have two main limitations: (1) They focus on minimizing the output error of
individual linear layers, without considering the architectural characteristics
of Transformers, and (2) they decompose a large weight matrix into two small
low-rank matrices. Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to
other compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce
runtime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small
matrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\tt A^\tt 3$, a
post-training low-rank approximation framework. $\tt A^\tt 3$ splits a
Transformer layer into three functional components, namely $\tt QK$, $\tt OV$,
and $\tt MLP$. For each component, $\tt A^\tt 3$ provides an analytical
solution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while
minimizing the component's functional loss ($\it i.e.$, error in attention
scores, attention outputs, and MLP outputs). This approach directly reduces
model sizes, KV cache sizes, and FLOPs without introducing any runtime
overheads. In addition, it provides a new narrative in advancing the
optimization problem from singular linear layer loss optimization toward
improved end-to-end performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that
$\tt A^\tt 3$ maintains superior performance compared to SoTAs. For example,
under the same reduction budget in computation and memory, our low-rank
approximated LLaMA 3.1-70B achieves a perplexity of 4.69 on WikiText-2,
outperforming the previous SoTA's 7.87 by 3.18. We also demonstrate the
versatility of $\tt A^\tt 3$, including KV cache compression, quantization, and
mixed-rank assignments for enhanced performance.

Abstract: Many-to-many summarization (M2MS) aims to process documents in any language
and generate the corresponding summaries also in any language. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have shown strong multi-lingual abilities, giving them
the potential to perform M2MS in real applications. This work presents a
systematic empirical study on LLMs' M2MS ability. Specifically, we first
reorganize M2MS data based on eight previous domain-specific datasets. The
reorganized data contains 47.8K samples spanning five domains and six
languages, which could be used to train and evaluate LLMs. Then, we benchmark
18 LLMs in a zero-shot manner and an instruction-tuning manner. Fine-tuned
traditional models (e.g., mBART) are also conducted for comparisons. Our
experiments reveal that, zero-shot LLMs achieve competitive results with
fine-tuned traditional models. After instruct-tuning, open-source LLMs can
significantly improve their M2MS ability, and outperform zero-shot LLMs
(including GPT-4) in terms of automatic evaluations. In addition, we
demonstrate that this task-specific improvement does not sacrifice the LLMs'
general task-solving abilities. However, as revealed by our human evaluation,
LLMs still face the factuality issue, and the instruction tuning might
intensify the issue. Thus, how to control factual errors becomes the key when
building LLM summarizers in real applications, and is worth noting in future
research.

Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, has shown impressive capabilities in complex
problems, e.g., mathematics and coding. Some pioneering studies attempt to
bring the success of LRMs in neural machine translation (MT). They try to build
LRMs with deep reasoning MT ability via reinforcement learning (RL). Despite
some progress that has been made, these attempts generally focus on several
high-resource languages, e.g., English and Chinese, leaving the performance on
other languages unclear. Besides, the reward modeling methods in previous work
do not fully unleash the potential of reinforcement learning in MT. In this
work, we first design a new reward modeling method that compares the
translation results of the policy MT model with a strong LRM (i.e.,
DeepSeek-R1-671B), and quantifies the comparisons to provide rewards.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the reward modeling method.
Using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the backbone, the trained model achieves the new
state-of-the-art performance in literary translation, and outperforms strong
LRMs including OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeeK-R1. Furthermore, we extend our method to
the multilingual settings with 11 languages. With a carefully designed
lightweight reward modeling in RL, we can simply transfer the strong MT ability
from a single direction into multiple (i.e., 90) translation directions and
achieve impressive multilingual MT performance.

Abstract: Systematic generalization remains challenging for current language models,
which are known to be both sensitive to semantically similar permutations of
the input and to struggle with known concepts presented in novel contexts.
Although benchmarks exist for assessing compositional behavior, it is unclear
how to measure the difficulty of a systematic generalization problem. In this
work, we show how one aspect of systematic generalization can be described by
the entropy of the distribution of component parts in the training data. We
formalize a framework for measuring entropy in a sequence-to-sequence task and
find that the performance of popular model architectures scales with the
entropy. Our work connects systematic generalization to information efficiency,
and our results indicate that success at high entropy can be achieved even
without built-in priors, and that success at low entropy can serve as a target
for assessing progress towards robust systematic generalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are demonstrably capable of cross-lingual
transfer, but can produce inconsistent output when prompted with the same
queries written in different languages. To understand how language models are
able to generalize knowledge from one language to the others, we apply the
logit lens to interpret the implicit steps taken by LLMs to solve multilingual
multi-choice reasoning questions. We find LLMs predict inconsistently and are
less accurate because they rely on subspaces of individual languages, rather
than working in a shared semantic space. While larger models are more
multilingual, we show their hidden states are more likely to dissociate from
the shared representation compared to smaller models, but are nevertheless more
capable of retrieving knowledge embedded across different languages. Finally,
we demonstrate that knowledge sharing can be modulated by steering the models'
latent processing towards the shared semantic space. We find reinforcing
utilization of the shared space improves the models' multilingual reasoning
performance, as a result of more knowledge transfer from, and better output
consistency with English.

Conclusion: 位置偏移是评估记忆风险的关键因素，调整敏感数据位置可有效降低风险，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Large language models are known to memorize parts of their training data,
posing risk of copyright violations. To systematically examine this risk, we
pretrain language models (1B/3B/8B) from scratch on 83B tokens, mixing
web-scale data with public domain books used to simulate copyrighted content at
controlled frequencies at lengths at least ten times longer than prior work. We
thereby identified the offset effect, a phenomenon characterized by two key
findings: (1) verbatim memorization is most strongly triggered by short
prefixes drawn from the beginning of the context window, with memorization
decreasing counterintuitively as prefix length increases; and (2) a sharp
decline in verbatim recall when prefix begins offset from the initial tokens of
the context window. We attribute this to positional fragility: models rely
disproportionately on the earliest tokens in their context window as retrieval
anchors, making them sensitive to even slight shifts. We further observe that
when the model fails to retrieve memorized content, it often produces
degenerated text. Leveraging these findings, we show that shifting sensitive
data deeper into the context window suppresses both extractable memorization
and degeneration. Our results suggest that positional offset is a critical and
previously overlooked axis for evaluating memorization risks, since prior work
implicitly assumed uniformity by probing only from the beginning of training
sequences.

Result: Personalized tool utilization improves user experience, but state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with joint reasoning on user and environmental factors.

Conclusion: Context-aware personalization is crucial for tool-augmented LLMs, revealing current model limitations.

Abstract: While integrating external tools into large language models (LLMs) enhances
their ability to access real-time information and domain-specific services,
existing approaches focus narrowly on functional tool selection following user
instructions, overlooking the context-aware personalization in tool selection.
This oversight leads to suboptimal user satisfaction and inefficient tool
utilization, particularly when overlapping toolsets require nuanced selection
based on contextual factors. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolSpectrum, a
benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in personalized tool
utilization. Specifically, we formalize two key dimensions of personalization,
user profile and environmental factors, and analyze their individual and
synergistic impacts on tool utilization. Through extensive experiments on
ToolSpectrum, we demonstrate that personalized tool utilization significantly
improves user experience across diverse scenarios. However, even
state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit the limited ability to reason jointly about user
profiles and environmental factors, often prioritizing one dimension at the
expense of the other. Our findings underscore the necessity of context-aware
personalization in tool-augmented LLMs and reveal critical limitations for
current models. Our data and code are available at

Abstract: Recent works have revealed the great potential of speculative decoding in
accelerating the autoregressive generation process of large language models.
The success of these methods relies on the alignment between draft candidates
and the sampled outputs of the target model. Existing methods mainly achieve
draft-target alignment with training-based methods, e.g., EAGLE, Medusa,
involving considerable training costs. In this paper, we present a
training-free alignment-augmented speculative decoding algorithm. We propose
alignment sampling, which leverages output distribution obtained in the
prefilling phase to provide more aligned draft candidates. To further benefit
from high-quality but non-aligned draft candidates, we also introduce a simple
yet effective flexible verification strategy. Through an adaptive probability
threshold, our approach can improve generation accuracy while further improving
inference efficiency. Experiments on 8 datasets (including question answering,
summarization and code completion tasks) show that our approach increases the
average generation score by 3.3 points for the LLaMA3 model. Our method

Abstract: Preference alignment has become a standard pipeline in finetuning models to
follow \emph{generic} human preferences. Majority of work seeks to optimize
model to produce responses that would be preferable \emph{on average},
simplifying the diverse and often \emph{contradicting} space of human
preferences. While research has increasingly focused on personalized alignment:
adapting models to individual user preferences, there is a lack of personalized
preference dataset which focus on nuanced individual-level preferences. To
address this, we introduce WikiPersona: the first fine-grained personalization
using well-documented, famous individuals. Our dataset challenges models to
align with these personas through an interpretable process: generating
verifiable textual descriptions of a persona's background and preferences in
addition to alignment. We systematically evaluate different personalization
approaches and find that as few-shot prompting with preferences and fine-tuning
fail to simultaneously ensure effectiveness and efficiency, using
\textit{inferred personal preferences} as prefixes enables effective
personalization, especially in topics where preferences clash while leading to
more equitable generalization across unseen personas.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive domains.
However, although RAG achieved successes across distinct domains, there are
still some unsolved challenges: 1) Effectiveness. Existing research mainly
focuses on developing more powerful RAG retrievers, but how to enhance the
generator's (LLM's) ability to utilize the retrieved information for reasoning
and generation? 2) Transparency. Most RAG methods ignore which retrieved
content actually contributes to the reasoning process, resulting in a lack of
interpretability and visibility. To address this, we propose ARENA
(Adaptive-Rewarded Evidence Navigation Agent), a transparent RAG generator
framework trained via reinforcement learning (RL) with our proposed rewards.
Based on the structured generation and adaptive reward calculation, our
RL-based training enables the model to identify key evidence, perform
structured reasoning, and generate answers with interpretable decision traces.
Applied to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, abundant experiments
with various RAG baselines demonstrate that our model achieves 10-30%
improvements on all multi-hop QA datasets, which is comparable with the SOTA
Commercially-developed LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1). Further analyses

extra training. Our models and codes are publicly released.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉内容如何影响视觉语言模型（VLM）对新闻内容的转发倾向，发现图像会增加虚假新闻的转发率，并提出了一种评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在新闻推荐系统中的广泛应用，其传播错误信息的风险增加，但视觉内容对VLM行为的影响尚不明确。

Method: 采用了一种基于越狱的提示策略，模拟具有反社会特质的用户行为，并使用多模态数据集（PolitiFact）进行实验。

Result: 图像使虚假新闻的转发率增加了15.0%，且模型对虚假新闻的敏感性因用户画像而异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态模型行为中的风险，呼吁开发针对性的评估和缓解策略。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly integrated into news recommendation
systems, raising concerns about their role in spreading misinformation. In
humans, visual content is known to boost credibility and shareability of
information, yet its effect on vision-language models (VLMs) remains unclear.
We present the first study examining how images influence VLMs' propensity to
reshare news content, whether this effect varies across model families, and how
persona conditioning and content attributes modulate this behavior. To support
this analysis, we introduce two methodological contributions: a
jailbreaking-inspired prompting strategy that elicits resharing decisions from
VLMs while simulating users with antisocial traits and political alignments;
and a multimodal dataset of fact-checked political news from PolitiFact, paired
with corresponding images and ground-truth veracity labels. Experiments across
model families reveal that image presence increases resharing rates by 4.8% for
true news and 15.0% for false news. Persona conditioning further modulates this
effect: Dark Triad traits amplify resharing of false news, whereas
Republican-aligned profiles exhibit reduced veracity sensitivity. Of all the
tested models, only Claude-3-Haiku demonstrates robustness to visual
misinformation. These findings highlight emerging risks in multimodal model
behavior and motivate the development of tailored evaluation frameworks and
mitigation strategies for personalized AI systems. Code and dataset are

<details>

Motivation: 当前CoT研究缺乏定量指标和可操作指南，尤其是在多模态场景下，无法评估不可测量的CoT能力。

Method: 提出推理边界（RB）作为CoT性能上限，并设计组合定律和边界划分机制，量化可测量和不可测量能力。

Result: 在13个任务和38个模型上的实验验证了框架的可行性，并扩展了LLM推理的评测基准。

Conclusion: RBF++为理解和优化LLM中的推理边界提供了新视角和工具。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has proven effective in enhancing large
language models (LLMs) on complex tasks, spurring research into its underlying
mechanisms. However, two primary challenges remain for real-world applications:
(1) the lack of quantitative metrics and actionable guidelines for evaluating
and optimizing measurable boundaries of CoT capability, and (2) the absence of
methods to assess boundaries of unmeasurable CoT capability, such as multimodal
perception. To address these gaps, we introduce the Reasoning Boundary
Framework++ (RBF++). To tackle the first challenge, we define the reasoning
boundary (RB) as the maximum limit of CoT performance. We also propose a
combination law for RBs, enabling quantitative analysis and offering actionable
guidance across various CoT tasks. For the second challenge, particularly in
multimodal scenarios, we introduce a constant assumption, which replaces
unmeasurable RBs with scenario-specific constants. Additionally, we propose the
reasoning boundary division mechanism, which divides unmeasurable RBs into two
sub-boundaries, facilitating the quantification and optimization of both
unmeasurable domain knowledge and multimodal perception capabilities. Extensive
experiments involving 38 models across 13 tasks validate the feasibility of our
framework in cross-modal settings. Additionally, we evaluate 10 CoT strategies,
offer insights into optimization and decay from two complementary perspectives,
and expand evaluation benchmarks for measuring RBs in LLM reasoning. We hope
this work advances the understanding of RBs and optimization strategies in
LLMs. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: GUARD框架通过动态推理时遗忘技术，避免微调对LLM性能的负面影响，实现选择性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在知识记忆方面表现强大，但选择性遗忘对模型安全和合规至关重要。现有方法通过微调模糊遗忘与保留知识的边界，影响性能。

Method: 提出GUARD框架，通过提示分类器检测遗忘目标，动态惩罚和过滤候选标记，结合标记匹配和语义匹配防止遗忘内容泄露。

Result: 在多个任务（如版权内容遗忘和实体遗忘）中，GUARD实现了强遗忘质量，同时几乎不影响LLM的通用能力。

Conclusion: GUARD在遗忘与实用性之间取得了优秀平衡，为LLM的安全部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
memorizing vast amounts of knowledge across diverse domains. However, the
ability to selectively forget specific knowledge is critical for ensuring the
safety and compliance of deployed models. Existing unlearning efforts typically
fine-tune the model with resources such as forget data, retain data, and a
calibration model. These additional gradient steps blur the decision boundary
between forget and retain knowledge, making unlearning often at the expense of
overall performance. To avoid the negative impact of fine-tuning, it would be
better to unlearn solely at inference time by safely guarding the model against
generating responses related to the forget target, without destroying the
fluency of text generation. In this work, we propose Generation-time Unlearning
via Adaptive Restriction and Detection (GUARD), a framework that enables
dynamic unlearning during LLM generation. Specifically, we first employ a
prompt classifier to detect unlearning targets and extract the corresponding
forbidden token. We then dynamically penalize and filter candidate tokens
during generation using a combination of token matching and semantic matching,
effectively preventing the model from leaking the forgotten content.
Experimental results on copyright content unlearning tasks over the Harry
Potter dataset and the MUSE benchmark, as well as entity unlearning tasks on
the TOFU dataset, demonstrate that GUARD achieves strong forget quality across
various tasks while causing almost no degradation to the LLM's general
capabilities, striking an excellent trade-off between forgetting and utility.

Conclusion: 需要进一步改进LLM在多轮状态化工具交互中的能力。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks that assess Language Models (LMs) as Language Agents
(LAs) for tool use primarily focus on stateless, single-turn interactions or
partial evaluations, such as tool selection in a single turn, overlooking the
inherent stateful nature of interactions in multi-turn applications. To fulfill
this gap, we propose \texttt{DialogTool}, a multi-turn dialogue dataset with
stateful tool interactions considering the whole life cycle of tool use, across
six key tasks in three stages: 1) \textit{tool creation}; 2) \textit{tool
utilization}: tool awareness, tool selection, tool execution; and 3)
\textit{role-consistent response}: response generation and role play.
Furthermore, we build \texttt{VirtualMobile} -- an embodied virtual mobile
evaluation environment to simulate API calls and assess the robustness of the
created APIs\footnote{We will use tools and APIs alternatively, there are no
significant differences between them in this paper.}. Taking advantage of these
artifacts, we conduct comprehensive evaluation on 13 distinct open- and
closed-source LLMs and provide detailed analysis at each stage, revealing that
the existing state-of-the-art LLMs still cannot perform well to use tools over

Abstract: To keep pace with the increasing pace of large language models (LLM)
development, model output evaluation has transitioned away from time-consuming
human evaluation to automatic evaluation, where LLMs themselves are tasked with
assessing and critiquing other model outputs. LLM-as-judge models are a class
of generative evaluators that excel in evaluating relatively simple domains,
like chat quality, but struggle in reasoning intensive domains where model
responses contain more substantive and challenging content. To remedy existing
judge shortcomings, we explore training judges with reinforcement learning
(RL). We make three key contributions: (1) We propose the Equivalent Initial
State Group Relative Policy Optimization (EIS-GRPO) algorithm, which allows us
to train our judge to be robust to positional biases that arise in more complex
evaluation settings. (2) We introduce ReasoningJudgeBench, a benchmark that
evaluates judges in diverse reasoning settings not covered by prior work. (3)
We train Judge for Reasoning (J4R), a 7B judge trained with EIS-GRPO that

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as evaluators
(LLM-as-a-Judge) for assessing the quality of machine-generated text. This
paradigm offers scalability and cost-effectiveness compared to human
annotation. However, the reliability and security of such systems, particularly
their robustness against adversarial manipulations, remain critical concerns.
This paper investigates the vulnerability of LLM-as-a-Judge architectures to
prompt-injection attacks, where malicious inputs are designed to compromise the
judge's decision-making process. We formalize two primary attack strategies:
Comparative Undermining Attack (CUA), which directly targets the final decision
output, and Justification Manipulation Attack (JMA), which aims to alter the
model's generated reasoning. Using the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG)
optimization method, we craft adversarial suffixes appended to one of the
responses being compared. Experiments conducted on the MT-Bench Human Judgments
dataset with open-source instruction-tuned LLMs (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and
Falcon3-3B-Instruct) demonstrate significant susceptibility. The CUA achieves
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 30\%, while JMA also shows notable
effectiveness. These findings highlight substantial vulnerabilities in current
LLM-as-a-Judge systems, underscoring the need for robust defense mechanisms and
further research into adversarial evaluation and trustworthiness in LLM-based
assessment frameworks.

Result: 发现随着代码片段接近输入上下文的中间位置，代码推理准确性显著下降，尤其是需要高语义回忆的技术（如SemTrace）。此外，词汇回忆（逐字检索）与语义回忆存在脱节。

Conclusion: 当前代码推理基准可能低估了LLM在利用上下文信息时的挑战，尤其是语义回忆方面的表现。

Abstract: Although modern Large Language Models (LLMs) support extremely large
contexts, their effectiveness in utilizing long context for code reasoning
remains unclear. This paper investigates LLM reasoning ability over code
snippets within large repositories and how it relates to their recall ability.
Specifically, we differentiate between lexical code recall (verbatim retrieval)
and semantic code recall (remembering what the code does). To measure semantic
recall, we propose SemTrace, a code reasoning technique where the impact of
specific statements on output is attributable and unpredictable. We also
present a method to quantify semantic recall sensitivity in existing
benchmarks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a significant drop
in code reasoning accuracy as a code snippet approaches the middle of the input
context, particularly with techniques requiring high semantic recall like
SemTrace. Moreover, we find that lexical recall varies by granularity, with
models excelling at function retrieval but struggling with line-by-line recall.
Notably, a disconnect exists between lexical and semantic recall, suggesting
different underlying mechanisms. Finally, our findings indicate that current
code reasoning benchmarks may exhibit low semantic recall sensitivity,
potentially underestimating LLM challenges in leveraging in-context
information.

Conclusion: 需结合需求发现、评估和监控，系统管理提示不足指定问题。

Abstract: Building LLM-powered software requires developers to communicate their
requirements through natural language, but developer prompts are frequently
underspecified, failing to fully capture many user-important requirements. In
this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of prompt underspecification,
showing that while LLMs can often (41.1%) guess unspecified requirements by
default, such behavior is less robust: Underspecified prompts are 2x more
likely to regress over model or prompt changes, sometimes with accuracy drops
by more than 20%. We then demonstrate that simply adding more requirements to a
prompt does not reliably improve performance, due to LLMs' limited
instruction-following capabilities and competing constraints, and standard
prompt optimizers do not offer much help. To address this, we introduce novel
requirements-aware prompt optimization mechanisms that can improve performance
by 4.8% on average over baselines that naively specify everything in the
prompt. Beyond prompt optimization, we envision that effectively managing
prompt underspecification requires a broader process, including proactive
requirements discovery, evaluation, and monitoring.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Thinkless将长链推理使用率降低50%-90%，显著提升效率。

Conclusion: Thinkless通过自适应推理模式选择，有效平衡了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models, capable of extended chain-of-thought reasoning,
have demonstrated remarkable performance on tasks requiring complex logical
inference. However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results
in substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems
admit straightforward solutions. This motivates an open question: Can LLMs
learn when to think? To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable
framework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and
long-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability.
Thinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two
control tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed
reasoning. At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy
Optimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of
hybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the
selection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the
accuracy of the generated answers. This decoupled formulation enables
fine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing
training and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO.
Empirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and
GSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% -
90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models. The

Abstract: The paradigm of using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) as evaluative judges has emerged as an effective
approach in RLHF and inference-time scaling. In this work, we propose
Multimodal Reasoner as a Judge (MR. Judge), a paradigm for empowering
general-purpose MLLMs judges with strong reasoning capabilities. Instead of
directly assigning scores for each response, we formulate the judgement process
as a reasoning-inspired multiple-choice problem. Specifically, the judge model
first conducts deliberate reasoning covering different aspects of the responses
and eventually selects the best response from them. This reasoning process not
only improves the interpretibility of the judgement, but also greatly enhances
the performance of MLLM judges. To cope with the lack of questions with scored
responses, we propose the following strategy to achieve automatic annotation:
1) Reverse Response Candidates Synthesis: starting from a supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) dataset, we treat the original response as the best candidate
and prompt the MLLM to generate plausible but flawed negative candidates. 2)
Text-based reasoning extraction: we carefully design a data synthesis pipeline
for distilling the reasoning capability from a text-based reasoning model,
which is adopted to enable the MLLM judges to regain complex reasoning ability
via warm up supervised fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our MR. Judge
is effective across a wide range of tasks. Specifically, our MR. Judge-7B
surpasses GPT-4o by 9.9% on VL-RewardBench, and improves performance on MM-Vet
during inference-time scaling by up to 7.7%.

Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models have achieved impressive performance on
various tasks by employing human-like deep thinking. However, the lengthy
thinking process substantially increases inference overhead, making efficiency
a critical bottleneck. In this work, we first demonstrate that NoThinking,
which prompts the reasoning model to skip thinking and directly generate the
final solution, is a better choice for relatively simple tasks in terms of both
performance and efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose AdaptThink, a novel
RL algorithm to teach reasoning models to choose the optimal thinking mode
adaptively based on problem difficulty. Specifically, AdaptThink features two
core components: (1) a constrained optimization objective that encourages the
model to choose NoThinking while maintaining the overall performance; (2) an
importance sampling strategy that balances Thinking and NoThinking samples
during on-policy training, thereby enabling cold start and allowing the model
to explore and exploit both thinking modes throughout the training process. Our
experiments indicate that AdaptThink significantly reduces the inference costs
while further enhancing performance. Notably, on three math datasets,
AdaptThink reduces the average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B
by 53% and improves its accuracy by 2.4%, highlighting the promise of adaptive
thinking-mode selection for optimizing the balance between reasoning quality

Abstract: Aligning language models with user intent is becoming increasingly relevant
to enhance user experience. This calls for designing methods that can allow
users to control the properties of the language that LMs generate. For example,
controlling the length of the generation, the complexity of the language that
gets chosen, the sentiment, tone, etc. Most existing work attempts to integrate
users' control by conditioning LM generations on natural language prompts or
discrete control signals, which are often brittle and hard to scale. In this
work, we are interested in \textit{continuous} control signals, ones that exist
along a spectrum that can't easily be captured in a natural language prompt or
via existing techniques in conditional generation. Through a case study in
controlling the precise response-length of generations produced by LMs, we
demonstrate how after fine-tuning, behaviors of language models can be
controlled via continuous signals -- as vectors that are interpolated between a
"low" and a "high" token embedding. Our method more reliably exerts
response-length control than in-context learning methods or fine-tuning methods
that represent the control signal as a discrete signal. Our full open-sourced

Abstract: Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations,
however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static
benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during
programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model
robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained.
Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent
results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We
introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness
from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality
inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code
summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM
generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language
specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new
output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats
the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical
strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack
setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming.
We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found
that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1
performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align
with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo,
despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated
lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.

Motivation: 多跳问答任务需要结合多段相关文本进行逐步推理，现有方法未充分考虑问题类型与方法的匹配性，因此提出BELLE框架以优化性能。

Method: BELLE框架通过双层次多智能体辩论机制，将不同方法视为“操作符”，并动态组合以适配问题类型。第一层次为多智能体辩论生成执行计划，第二层次引入快慢辩论者监控观点变化合理性。

Result: BELLE在多个数据集上显著优于基线方法，且在复杂多跳问答场景中具有更高的成本效益。

Conclusion: BELLE通过问题类型与方法的动态匹配，提升了多跳问答的性能和效率，为LLM在多跳推理任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (QA) involves finding multiple relevant passages
and performing step-by-step reasoning to answer complex questions. Previous
works on multi-hop QA employ specific methods from different modeling
perspectives based on large language models (LLMs), regardless of the question
types. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of public multi-hop
QA benchmarks, dividing the questions into four types and evaluating five types
of cutting-edge methods for multi-hop QA: Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Single-step,
Iterative-step, Sub-step, and Adaptive-step. We find that different types of
multi-hop questions have varying degrees of sensitivity to different types of
methods. Thus, we propose a Bi-levEL muLti-agEnt reasoning (BELLE) framework to
address multi-hop QA by specifically focusing on the correspondence between
question types and methods, where each type of method is regarded as an
''operator'' by prompting LLMs differently. The first level of BELLE includes
multiple agents that debate to obtain an executive plan of combined
''operators'' to address the multi-hop QA task comprehensively. During the
debate, in addition to the basic roles of affirmative debater, negative
debater, and judge, at the second level, we further leverage fast and slow
debaters to monitor whether changes in viewpoints are reasonable. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BELLE significantly outperforms strong baselines
in various datasets. Additionally, the model consumption of BELLE is higher
cost-effectiveness than that of single models in more complex multi-hop QA
scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the performance of LLMs on a new task that
requires combining discussion with background knowledge for summarization. This
aims to address the limitation of outside observer confusion in existing
dialogue summarization systems due to their reliance solely on discussion
information. To achieve this, we model the task output as background and
opinion summaries and define two standardized summarization patterns. To
support assessment, we introduce the first benchmark comprising high-quality
samples consistently annotated by human experts and propose a novel
hierarchical evaluation framework with fine-grained, interpretable metrics. We
evaluate 12 LLMs under structured-prompt and self-reflection paradigms. Our
findings reveal: (1) LLMs struggle with background summary retrieval,
generation, and opinion summary integration. (2) Even top LLMs achieve less
than 69% average performance across both patterns. (3) Current LLMs lack
adequate self-evaluation and self-correction capabilities for this task.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating text that closely resembles human writing across a wide range of
styles and genres. However, such capabilities are prone to potential misuse,
such as fake news generation, spam email creation, and misuse in academic
assignments. As a result, accurate detection of AI-generated text and
identification of the model that generated it are crucial for maintaining the
responsible use of LLMs. In this work, we addressed two sub-tasks put forward
by the Defactify workshop under AI-Generated Text Detection shared task at the
Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025): Task A
involved distinguishing between human-authored or AI-generated text, while Task
B focused on attributing text to its originating language model. For each task,
we proposed two neural architectures: an optimized model and a simpler variant.
For Task A, the optimized neural architecture achieved fifth place with $F1$
score of 0.994, and for Task B, the simpler neural architecture also ranked
fifth place with $F1$ score of 0.627.

Result: DeepSeek-R1在10-shot诊断准确率仅48%，推理召回率64%；微调后分别提升29%和41%。

Conclusion: MedCaseReasoning填补了医学推理评估的空白，微调显著改善LLMs表现。

Abstract: Doctors and patients alike increasingly use Large Language Models (LLMs) to
diagnose clinical cases. However, unlike domains such as math or coding, where
correctness can be objectively defined by the final answer, medical diagnosis
requires both the outcome and the reasoning process to be accurate. Currently,
widely used medical benchmarks like MedQA and MMLU assess only accuracy in the
final answer, overlooking the quality and faithfulness of the clinical
reasoning process. To address this limitation, we introduce MedCaseReasoning,
the first open-access dataset for evaluating LLMs on their ability to align
with clinician-authored diagnostic reasoning. The dataset includes 14,489
diagnostic question-and-answer cases, each paired with detailed reasoning
statements derived from open-access medical case reports. We evaluate
state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs on MedCaseReasoning and find significant
shortcomings in their diagnoses and reasoning: for instance, the top-performing
open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, achieves only 48% 10-shot diagnostic accuracy
and mentions only 64% of the clinician reasoning statements (recall). However,
we demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on the reasoning traces derived from
MedCaseReasoning significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and clinical
reasoning recall by an average relative gain of 29% and 41%, respectively. The

Method: 提出token masking regularization方法，随机以概率p替换输入token为[MASK]，引入随机扰动以鼓励模型捕捉更深层次的token间依赖关系。

Result: 在多种模型（mBERT、Qwen2.5-0.5B、TinyLlama-1.1B）上，语言识别和情感分析任务中表现优于标准正则化技术，并发现任务特定的最佳掩码率（p=0.1为通用默认值）。

Conclusion: 掩码正则化通过减少过拟合和梯度平滑（隐式集成）提升了模型性能。

Abstract: While transformer-based models achieve strong performance on text
classification, we explore whether masking input tokens can further enhance
their effectiveness. We propose token masking regularization, a simple yet
theoretically motivated method that randomly replaces input tokens with a
special [MASK] token at probability p. This introduces stochastic perturbations
during training, leading to implicit gradient averaging that encourages the
model to capture deeper inter-token dependencies. Experiments on language
identification and sentiment analysis -- across diverse models (mBERT,
Qwen2.5-0.5B, TinyLlama-1.1B) -- show consistent improvements over standard
regularization techniques. We identify task-specific optimal masking rates,
with p = 0.1 as a strong general default. We attribute the gains to two key
effects: (1) input perturbation reduces overfitting, and (2) gradient-level
smoothing acts as implicit ensembling.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have fueled the vision of
automated scientific discovery, often called AI Co-Scientists. To date, prior
work casts these systems as generative co-authors responsible for crafting
hypotheses, synthesizing code, or drafting manuscripts. In this work, we
explore a complementary application: using LLMs as verifiers to automate the
\textbf{academic verification of scientific manuscripts}. To that end, we
introduce SPOT, a dataset of 83 published papers paired with 91 errors
significant enough to prompt errata or retraction, cross-validated with actual
authors and human annotators. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on SPOT, we find
that none surpasses 21.1\% recall or 6.1\% precision (o3 achieves the best
scores, with all others near zero). Furthermore, confidence estimates are
uniformly low, and across eight independent runs, models rarely rediscover the
same errors, undermining their reliability. Finally, qualitative analysis with
domain experts reveals that even the strongest models make mistakes resembling
student-level misconceptions derived from misunderstandings. These findings
highlight the substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and the
requirements for dependable AI-assisted academic verification.

medical terminology. While human evaluation tends to be more reliable, it can
be very costly and may as well suffer from inaccuracies due to limits in human
expertise and motivation. Although there are some evaluation methods based on
LLMs, their usability in the medical field is limited due to their proprietary
nature or lack of expertise. To tackle these challenges, we present
AutoMedEval, an open-sourced automatic evaluation model with 13B parameters
specifically engineered to measure the question-answering proficiency of
medical LLMs. The overarching objective of AutoMedEval is to assess the quality

Abstract: Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in generating
chart rendering code, chart editing presents a greater challenge. This
difficulty stems from its nature as a labor-intensive task for humans that also
demands MLLMs to integrate chart understanding, complex reasoning, and precise
intent interpretation. While many MLLMs claim such editing capabilities,
current assessments typically rely on limited case studies rather than robust
evaluation methodologies, highlighting the urgent need for a comprehensive
evaluation framework. In this work, we propose ChartEdit, a new high-quality
benchmark designed for chart editing tasks. This benchmark comprises $1,405$
diverse editing instructions applied to $233$ real-world charts, with each
instruction-chart instance having been manually annotated and validated for
accuracy. Utilizing ChartEdit, we evaluate the performance of 10 mainstream
MLLMs across two types of experiments, assessing them at both the code and
chart levels. The results suggest that large-scale models can generate code to
produce images that partially match the reference images. However, their
ability to generate accurate edits according to the instructions remains
limited. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) model achieves a score of only $59.96$,
highlighting significant challenges in precise modification. In contrast,
small-scale models, including chart-domain models, struggle both with following
editing instructions and generating overall chart images, underscoring the need

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have prompted academic
concerns about their impact on academic writing. Existing studies have
primarily examined LLM usage in academic writing through quantitative
approaches, such as word frequency statistics and probability-based analyses.
However, few have systematically examined the potential impact of LLMs on the
linguistic characteristics of academic writing. To address this gap, we
conducted a large-scale analysis across 823,798 abstracts published in last
decade from arXiv dataset. Through the linguistic analysis of features such as
the frequency of LLM-preferred words, lexical complexity, syntactic complexity,
cohesion, readability and sentiment, the results indicate a significant
increase in the proportion of LLM-preferred words in abstracts, revealing the
widespread influence of LLMs on academic writing. Additionally, we observed an
increase in lexical complexity and sentiment in the abstracts, but a decrease
in syntactic complexity, suggesting that LLMs introduce more new vocabulary and
simplify sentence structure. However, the significant decrease in cohesion and
readability indicates that abstracts have fewer connecting words and are
becoming more difficult to read. Moreover, our analysis reveals that scholars
with weaker English proficiency were more likely to use the LLMs for academic
writing, and focused on improving the overall logic and fluency of the
abstracts. Finally, at discipline level, we found that scholars in Computer
Science showed more pronounced changes in writing style, while the changes in
Mathematics were minimal.

Conclusion: TKRE通过结合生成和判别学习范式，有效解决了FSRE任务，展示了在更广泛低资源应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Few-Shot Relation Extraction (FSRE) remains a challenging task due to the
scarcity of annotated data and the limited generalization capabilities of
existing models. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
potential in FSRE through in-context learning (ICL), their general-purpose
training objectives often result in suboptimal performance for task-specific
relation extraction. To overcome these challenges, we propose TKRE (Two-Stage
Knowledge-Guided Pre-training for Relation Extraction), a novel framework that
synergistically integrates LLMs with traditional relation extraction models,
bridging generative and discriminative learning paradigms. TKRE introduces two
key innovations: (1) leveraging LLMs to generate explanation-driven knowledge
and schema-constrained synthetic data, addressing the issue of data scarcity;
and (2) a two-stage pre-training strategy combining Masked Span Language
Modeling (MSLM) and Span-Level Contrastive Learning (SCL) to enhance relational
reasoning and generalization. Together, these components enable TKRE to
effectively tackle FSRE tasks. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate the efficacy of TKRE, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in
FSRE and underscoring its potential for broader application in low-resource
scenarios. \footnote{The code and data are released on

Conclusion: IPL方法有效提升了移动代理的性能和泛化能力，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Chain of Action-Planning Thoughts (CoaT) paradigm has been shown to
improve the reasoning performance of VLM-based mobile agents in GUI tasks.
However, the scarcity of diverse CoaT trajectories limits the expressiveness
and generalization ability of such agents. While self-training is commonly
employed to address data scarcity, existing approaches either overlook the
correctness of intermediate reasoning steps or depend on expensive
process-level annotations to construct process reward models (PRM). To address
the above problems, we propose an Iterative Preference Learning (IPL) that
constructs a CoaT-tree through interative sampling, scores leaf nodes using
rule-based reward, and backpropagates feedback to derive Thinking-level Direct
Preference Optimization (T-DPO) pairs. To prevent overfitting during warm-up
supervised fine-tuning, we further introduce a three-stage instruction
evolution, which leverages GPT-4o to generate diverse Q\&A pairs based on real
mobile UI screenshots, enhancing both generality and layout understanding.
Experiments on three standard Mobile GUI-agent benchmarks demonstrate that our
agent MobileIPL outperforms strong baselines, including continual pretraining
models such as OS-ATLAS and UI-TARS. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three standard Mobile GUI-Agents benchmarks and shows strong

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) tasks, which aim to
find answers based on knowledge graphs (KGs) for natural language questions.
Existing LLMs-based KGQA methods typically follow the Graph Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (GraphRAG) paradigm, which first retrieves reasoning paths from the
large KGs, and then generates the answers based on them. However, these methods
emphasize the exploration of new optimal reasoning paths in KGs while ignoring
the exploitation of historical reasoning paths, which may lead to sub-optimal
reasoning paths. Additionally, the complex semantics contained in questions may
lead to the retrieval of inaccurate reasoning paths. To address these issues,
this paper proposes a novel and training-free framework for KGQA tasks called
Reward-guided Tree Search on Graph (RTSoG). RTSoG decomposes an original
question into a series of simpler and well-defined sub-questions to handle the
complex semantics. Then, a Self-Critic Monte Carlo Tree Search (SC-MCTS) guided
by a reward model is introduced to iteratively retrieve weighted reasoning

according to their weights to generate the final answers. Extensive experiments
on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RTSoG. Notably, it achieves
8.7\% and 7.0\% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有机器生成文本检测方法在可解释性上的不足。

Method: 使用图神经网络和词共现图表示文本，结合后解释方法提取可解释的文本模式。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，提取的模式有效区分人机文本。

Conclusion: LM$^2$otifs在检测和解释机器生成文本方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The impressive ability of large language models to generate natural text
across various tasks has led to critical challenges in authorship
authentication. Although numerous detection methods have been developed to
differentiate between machine-generated texts (MGT) and human-generated texts
(HGT), the explainability of these methods remains a significant gap.
Traditional explainability techniques often fall short in capturing the complex
word relationships that distinguish HGT from MGT. To address this limitation,
we present LM$^2$otifs, a novel explainable framework for MGT detection.
Inspired by probabilistic graphical models, we provide a theoretical rationale
for the effectiveness. LM$^2$otifs utilizes eXplainable Graph Neural Networks
to achieve both accurate detection and interpretability. The LM$^2$otifs
pipeline operates in three key stages: first, it transforms text into graphs
based on word co-occurrence to represent lexical dependencies; second, graph
neural networks are used for prediction; and third, a post-hoc explainability
method extracts interpretable motifs, offering multi-level explanations from
individual words to sentence structures. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the comparable performance of LM$^2$otifs. The
empirical evaluation of the extracted explainable motifs confirms their
effectiveness in differentiating HGT and MGT. Furthermore, qualitative analysis
reveals distinct and visible linguistic fingerprints characteristic of MGT.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly power mental-health chatbots, yet
the field still lacks a scalable, theory-grounded way to decide which model is
most effective to deploy. We present ESC-Judge, the first end-to-end evaluation
framework that (i) grounds head-to-head comparisons of emotional-support LLMs
in Clara Hill's established Exploration-Insight-Action counseling model,
providing a structured and interpretable view of performance, and (ii) fully
automates the evaluation pipeline at scale. ESC-Judge operates in three stages:
first, it synthesizes realistic help-seeker roles by sampling empirically
salient attributes such as stressors, personality, and life history; second, it
has two candidate support agents conduct separate sessions with the same role,
isolating model-specific strategies; and third, it asks a specialized judge LLM
to express pairwise preferences across rubric-anchored skills that span the
Exploration, Insight, and Action spectrum. In our study, ESC-Judge matched
PhD-level annotators on 85 percent of Exploration, 83 percent of Insight, and
86 percent of Action decisions, demonstrating human-level reliability at a
fraction of the cost. All code, prompts, synthetic roles, transcripts, and

Abstract: Legal contracts possess an inherent, semantically vital structure (e.g.,
sections, clauses) that is crucial for human comprehension but whose impact on
LLM processing remains under-explored. This paper investigates the effects of
explicit input text structure and prompt engineering on the performance of
GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 on a legal question-answering task using an excerpt of the
CUAD. We compare model exact-match accuracy across various input formats:
well-structured plain-text (human-generated from CUAD), plain-text cleaned of
line breaks, extracted plain-text from Azure OCR, plain-text extracted by
GPT-4o Vision, and extracted (and interpreted) Markdown (MD) from GPT-4o
Vision. To give an indication of the impact of possible prompt engineering, we
assess the impact of shifting task instructions to the system prompt and
explicitly informing the model about the structured nature of the input. Our
findings reveal that GPT-4o demonstrates considerable robustness to variations
in input structure, but lacks in overall performance. Conversely, GPT-4.1's
performance is markedly sensitive; poorly structured inputs yield suboptimal
results (but identical with GPT-4o), while well-structured formats (original
CUAD text, GPT-4o Vision text and GPT-4o MD) improve exact-match accuracy by
~20 percentage points. Optimizing the system prompt to include task details and
an advisory about structured input further elevates GPT-4.1's accuracy by an
additional ~10-13 percentage points, with Markdown ultimately achieving the
highest performance under these conditions (79 percentage points overall
exact-match accuracy). This research empirically demonstrates that while newer
models exhibit greater resilience, careful input structuring and strategic
prompt design remain critical for optimizing the performance of LLMs, and can
significantly affect outcomes in high-stakes legal applications.

Abstract: Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models

open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected
legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule
application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions

struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal
reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in
differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Adopting an

Abstract: Autoregressive models have become the de facto choice for sequence generation
tasks, but standard approaches treat digits as independent tokens and apply
cross-entropy loss, overlooking the coherent structure of numerical sequences.
This paper introduces Numerical Token Integrity Loss (NTIL) to address this

Mover's Distance (EMD) to preserve ordinal relationships between numerical
values, and (2) sequence-level, where it penalizes the overall discrepancy
between the predicted and actual sequences. This dual approach improves
numerical prediction and integrates effectively with LLMs/MLLMs. Extensive
experiments show significant performance improvements with NTIL.

Abstract: Prior research diverges on language diversity in LLM fine-tuning: Some
studies report benefits while others find no advantages. Through controlled

resolve these disparities. We find that expanding language diversity during
fine-tuning improves translation quality for both unsupervised and --
surprisingly -- supervised pairs, despite less diverse models being fine-tuned
exclusively on these supervised pairs. However, benefits plateau or decrease
beyond a certain diversity threshold. We show that increased language diversity
creates more language-agnostic representations. These representational
adaptations help explain the improved performance in models fine-tuned with
greater diversity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across diverse tasks and languages. In this study, we focus on
natural language understanding in three classical languages -- Sanskrit,
Ancient Greek and Latin -- to investigate the factors affecting cross-lingual
zero-shot generalization. First, we explore named entity recognition and
machine translation into English. While LLMs perform equal to or better than
fine-tuned baselines on out-of-domain data, smaller models often struggle,
especially with niche or abstract entity types. In addition, we concentrate on
Sanskrit by presenting a factoid question-answering (QA) dataset and show that
incorporating context via retrieval-augmented generation approach significantly
boosts performance. In contrast, we observe pronounced performance drops for
smaller LLMs across these QA tasks. These results suggest model scale as an
important factor influencing cross-lingual generalization. Assuming that models
used such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1 are not instruction fine-tuned on classical
languages, our findings provide insights into how LLMs may generalize on these
languages and their consequent utility in classical studies.

including those that scales output length with complexity during inference, in
generating programs, which are executed to output the plan. We consider not
only standard Python code, but also the code to a constraint satisfaction

programming often but not always outperforms planning. Our detailed error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
translating natural language questions about relational databases into SQL
queries. In particular, test-time scaling techniques such as Self-Consistency
and Self-Correction can enhance SQL generation accuracy by increasing
computational effort during inference. However, these methods have notable
limitations: Self-Consistency may select suboptimal outputs despite majority
votes, while Self-Correction typically addresses only syntactic errors. To
leverage the strengths of both approaches, we propose CSC-SQL, a novel method
that integrates Self-Consistency and Self-Correction. CSC-SQL selects the two
most frequently occurring outputs from parallel sampling and feeds them into a
merge revision model for correction. Additionally, we employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to fine-tune both the SQL generation and
revision models via reinforcement learning, significantly enhancing output
quality. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of
CSC-SQL. On the BIRD development set, our 3B model achieves 65.28% execution

Motivation: LLMs struggle with ambiguous tourist inquiries and lack proactive guidance due to poor training data quality.

Method: SynPT uses LLM-driven user and assistant agents to simulate dialogues, generating a high-quality dataset (SynPT-Dialog) for fine-tuning.

Result: SynPT outperforms existing methods in mining implicit intentions, validated by human and LLM evaluations.

Conclusion: SynPT effectively addresses tourism-specific LLM limitations and demonstrates practical adaptability.

Abstract: In the tourism domain, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to mine
implicit user intentions from tourists' ambiguous inquiries and lack the
capacity to proactively guide users toward clarifying their needs. A critical
bottleneck is the scarcity of high-quality training datasets that facilitate
proactive questioning and implicit intention mining. While recent advances
leverage LLM-driven data synthesis to generate such datasets and transfer
specialized knowledge to downstream models, existing approaches suffer from
several shortcomings: (1) lack of adaptation to the tourism domain, (2) skewed
distributions of detail levels in initial inquiries, (3) contextual redundancy
in the implicit intention mining module, and (4) lack of explicit thinking
about tourists' emotions and intention values. Therefore, we propose SynPT (A
Data Synthesis Method Driven by LLMs for Proactive Mining of Implicit User
Intentions in the Tourism), which constructs an LLM-driven user agent and
assistant agent to simulate dialogues based on seed data collected from Chinese
tourism websites. This approach addresses the aforementioned limitations and
generates SynPT-Dialog, a training dataset containing explicit reasoning. The
dataset is utilized to fine-tune a general LLM, enabling it to proactively mine
implicit user intentions. Experimental evaluations, conducted from both human
and LLM perspectives, demonstrate the superiority of SynPT compared to existing
methods. Furthermore, we analyze key hyperparameters and present case studies
to illustrate the practical applicability of our method, including discussions
on its adaptability to English-language scenarios. All code and data are

Abstract: Clinical guidelines, typically structured as decision trees, are central to

introduce MedGUIDE, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on their ability to
make guideline-consistent clinical decisions. MedGUIDE is constructed from 55
curated NCCN decision trees across 17 cancer types and uses clinical scenarios
generated by LLMs to create a large pool of multiple-choice diagnostic
questions. We apply a two-stage quality selection process, combining
expert-labeled reward models and LLM-as-a-judge ensembles across ten clinical
and linguistic criteria, to select 7,747 high-quality samples. We evaluate 25
LLMs spanning general-purpose, open-source, and medically specialized models,
and find that even domain-specific LLMs often underperform on tasks requiring
structured guideline adherence. We also test whether performance can be
improved via in-context guideline inclusion or continued pretraining. Our
findings underscore the importance of MedGUIDE in assessing whether LLMs can
operate safely within the procedural frameworks expected in real-world clinical
settings.

Conclusion: 方言指导的LLM评估框架有效提升了低资源语言翻译评估的准确性。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) for low-resource languages poses a
persistent challenge, primarily due to the limited availability of high quality
reference translations. This issue is further exacerbated in languages with
multiple dialects, where linguistic diversity and data scarcity hinder robust
evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising solution through
reference-free evaluation techniques; however, their effectiveness diminishes
in the absence of dialect-specific context and tailored guidance. In this work,
we propose a comprehensive framework that enhances LLM-based MT evaluation
using a dialect guided approach. We extend the ONUBAD dataset by incorporating
Sylheti-English sentence pairs, corresponding machine translations, and Direct
Assessment (DA) scores annotated by native speakers. To address the vocabulary
gap, we augment the tokenizer vocabulary with dialect-specific terms. We
further introduce a regression head to enable scalar score prediction and
design a dialect-guided (DG) prompting strategy. Our evaluation across multiple
LLMs shows that the proposed pipeline consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving the highest gain of +0.1083 in Spearman correlation, along
with improvements across other evaluation settings. The dataset and the code

Abstract: Interactive Fiction games (IF games) are where players interact through
natural language commands. While recent advances in Artificial Intelligence
agents have reignited interest in IF games as a domain for studying
decision-making, existing approaches prioritize task-specific performance
metrics over human-like comprehension of narrative context and gameplay logic.
This work presents a cognitively inspired framework that guides Large Language
Models (LLMs) to learn and play IF games systematically. Our proposed
**L**earning to **P**lay **L**ike **H**umans (LPLH) framework integrates three
key components: (1) structured map building to capture spatial and narrative
relationships, (2) action learning to identify context-appropriate commands,
and (3) feedback-driven experience analysis to refine decision-making over
time. By aligning LLMs-based agents' behavior with narrative intent and
commonsense constraints, LPLH moves beyond purely exploratory strategies to
deliver more interpretable, human-like performance. Crucially, this approach
draws on cognitive science principles to more closely simulate how human
players read, interpret, and respond within narrative worlds. As a result, LPLH
reframes the IF games challenge as a learning problem for LLMs-based agents,
offering a new path toward robust, context-aware gameplay in complex text-based
environments.

this method to AI-generated texts used in tutor training lessons. Results show
a high alignment between the automated and manually curated word sets, with a

Despite the huge success of large language models, many disadvantages still

application scenarios of traditional and older approaches and techniques.
  In this paper we survey recent publications in the application scenarios
classification, information and relation extraction, text simplification as
well as text summarization. After defining our terminology, i.e., which
features are characteristic for traditional techniques in our interpretation
for the five scenarios, we survey if such traditional approaches are still

application scenarios still exhibit traditional models in one way or another,

TL;DR: EffiBench-X是首个多语言基准测试，用于评估LLM生成代码的效率，发现LLM在代码效率上普遍低于人类专家水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准主要关注功能正确性，缺乏对代码效率和多语言支持的评估。

Method: 引入EffiBench-X，支持Python、C++、Java等六种语言，使用人类专家解决方案作为效率基准。

Result: LLM生成的代码效率平均仅为人类专家的62%，且在不同语言间表现差异显著。

Conclusion: 研究强调了优化LLM以提升多语言代码效率的重要性。

Abstract: Existing code generation benchmarks primarily evaluate functional
correctness, with limited focus on code efficiency and often restricted to a
single language like Python. To address this gap, we introduce EffiBench-X, the
first multi-language benchmark designed to measure the efficiency of
LLM-generated code. EffiBench-X supports Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Ruby,
and Golang. It comprises competitive programming tasks with human-expert
solutions as efficiency baselines. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on
EffiBench-X reveals that while models generate functionally correct code, they
consistently underperform human experts in efficiency. Even the most efficient
LLM-generated solutions (Qwen3-32B) achieve only around \textbf{62\%} of human
efficiency on average, with significant language-specific variations. LLMs show
better efficiency in Python, Ruby, and JavaScript than in Java, C++, and
Golang. For instance, DeepSeek-R1's Python code is significantly more efficient
than its Java code. These results highlight the critical need for research into
LLM optimization techniques to improve code efficiency across diverse
languages. The dataset and evaluation infrastructure are submitted and

Motivation: 现有研究对LALMs的推理能力，尤其是多跳推理能力缺乏系统性评估，SAKURA填补了这一空白。

Method: 引入SAKURA基准测试，评估LALMs基于语音和音频信息的多跳推理能力。

Result: LALMs在整合语音/音频信息进行多跳推理时表现不佳，即使能正确提取相关信息。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LALMs在多模态推理中的根本性挑战，为未来研究提供了资源和见解。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend the large language models with
multimodal understanding in speech, audio, etc. While their performances on
speech and audio-processing tasks are extensively studied, their reasoning
abilities remain underexplored. Particularly, their multi-hop reasoning, the
ability to recall and integrate multiple facts, lacks systematic evaluation.
Existing benchmarks focus on general speech and audio-processing tasks,
conversational abilities, and fairness but overlook this aspect. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SAKURA, a benchmark assessing LALMs' multi-hop reasoning
based on speech and audio information. Results show that LALMs struggle to
integrate speech/audio representations for multi-hop reasoning, even when they
extract the relevant information correctly, highlighting a fundamental
challenge in multimodal reasoning. Our findings expose a critical limitation in
LALMs, offering insights and resources for future research.

Motivation: 多跳问答任务对语言模型提出了更高的要求，但因果掩码可能限制其推理能力。本文旨在探索LMs在MHQA中的表现及其优化方法。

Method: 通过排列搜索结果的顺序，比较编码器-解码器模型与因果解码器模型的性能，并分析注意力权重的分布。

Result: Flan-T5模型在MHQA中表现更优；文档顺序与推理链一致时性能最佳；修改因果掩码可提升因果解码器模型的性能。

Abstract: Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) adds layers of complexity to question
answering, making it more challenging. When Language Models (LMs) are prompted
with multiple search results, they are tasked not only with retrieving relevant
information but also employing multi-hop reasoning across the information
sources. Although LMs perform well on traditional question-answering tasks, the
causal mask can hinder their capacity to reason across complex contexts. In
this paper, we explore how LMs respond to multi-hop questions by permuting
search results (retrieved documents) under various configurations. Our study
reveals interesting findings as follows: 1) Encoder-decoder models, such as the
ones in the Flan-T5 family, generally outperform causal decoder-only LMs in
MHQA tasks, despite being significantly smaller in size; 2) altering the order
of gold documents reveals distinct trends in both Flan T5 models and fine-tuned
decoder-only models, with optimal performance observed when the document order
aligns with the reasoning chain order; 3) enhancing causal decoder-only models
with bi-directional attention by modifying the causal mask can effectively
boost their end performance. In addition to the above, we conduct a thorough
investigation of the distribution of LM attention weights in the context of
MHQA. Our experiments reveal that attention weights tend to peak at higher
values when the resulting answer is correct. We leverage this finding to
heuristically improve LMs' performance on this task. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/hwy9855/MultiHopQA-Reasoning.

Motivation: 随着文本大型语言模型（LLMs）的成功，多模态社区开始探索如何将音频等其他模态与文本结合以实现类似的多模态能力。为此，需要评估LALMs在推理任务上的表现，而不仅仅是传统的分类或生成任务。

Method: 论文提出了TREA数据集，用于评估LALMs的时序推理能力，并设计了一种不确定性度量方法，用于评估模型对输入扰动的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，现有的开源LALMs在TREA任务上的表现普遍低于人类水平。此外，准确性和不确定性度量并不总是相关，表明需要更全面的评估方法。

Conclusion: 论文强调了在关键应用中全面评估LALMs的重要性，并提出了一种新的评估框架。

Abstract: The popular success of text-based large language models (LLM) has streamlined
the attention of the multimodal community to combine other modalities like
vision and audio along with text to achieve similar multimodal capabilities. In
this quest, large audio language models (LALMs) have to be evaluated on
reasoning related tasks which are different from traditional classification or
generation tasks. Towards this goal, we propose a novel dataset called temporal
reasoning evaluation of audio (TREA).
  We benchmark open-source LALMs and observe that they are consistently behind
human capabilities on the tasks in the TREA dataset. While evaluating LALMs, we
also propose an uncertainty metric, which computes the invariance of the model
to semantically identical perturbations of the input. Our analysis shows that
the accuracy and uncertainty metrics are not necessarily correlated and thus,
points to a need for wholesome evaluation of LALMs for high-stakes
applications.

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs在通用语义表示中的应用开辟了新途径，有望推动语义分析、翻译等领域的进展。

Abstract: The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) is a linguistic theory based on a
universal set of semantic primes: simple, primitive word-meanings that have
been shown to exist in most, if not all, languages of the world. According to
this framework, any word, regardless of complexity, can be paraphrased using
these primes, revealing a clear and universally translatable meaning. These
paraphrases, known as explications, can offer valuable applications for many
natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but producing them has traditionally
been a slow, manual process. In this work, we present the first study of using
large language models (LLMs) to generate NSM explications. We introduce
automatic evaluation methods, a tailored dataset for training and evaluation,
and fine-tuned models for this task. Our 1B and 8B models outperform GPT-4o in
producing accurate, cross-translatable explications, marking a significant step
toward universal semantic representation with LLMs and opening up new
possibilities for applications in semantic analysis, translation, and beyond.

Abstract: Detecting deviant language such as sexism, or nuanced language such as

strong results on these tasks, they often come with significant computational
cost and high data demands. In this work, we propose \textbf{Cla}ss
\textbf{D}istillation (ClaD), a novel training paradigm that targets the core
challenge: distilling a small, well-defined target class from a highly diverse
and heterogeneous background. ClaD integrates two key innovations: (i) a loss
function informed by the structural properties of class distributions, based on
Mahalanobis distance, and (ii) an interpretable decision algorithm optimized
for class separation. Across three benchmark detection tasks -- sexism,
metaphor, and sarcasm -- ClaD outperforms competitive baselines, and even with
smaller language models and orders of magnitude fewer parameters, achieves
performance comparable to several large language models (LLMs). These results
demonstrate ClaD as an efficient tool for pragmatic language understanding
tasks that require gleaning a small target class from a larger heterogeneous

The atomicity of the sub-queries in the leaf nodes ensures more precise

prompting method that outperforms standard prompting techniques and partially
mitigates the bimodality issue.

Conclusion: 需在语言技术开发中考虑SES差异，以减少数字鸿沟。

Abstract: Socioeconomic status (SES) fundamentally influences how people interact with
each other and more recently, with digital technologies like Large Language
Models (LLMs). While previous research has highlighted the interaction between
SES and language technology, it was limited by reliance on proxy metrics and
synthetic data. We survey 1,000 individuals from diverse socioeconomic
backgrounds about their use of language technologies and generative AI, and
collect 6,482 prompts from their previous interactions with LLMs. We find
systematic differences across SES groups in language technology usage (i.e.,
frequency, performed tasks), interaction styles, and topics. Higher SES entails
a higher level of abstraction, convey requests more concisely, and topics like
'inclusivity' and 'travel'. Lower SES correlates with higher
anthropomorphization of LLMs (using ''hello'' and ''thank you'') and more
concrete language. Our findings suggest that while generative language
technologies are becoming more accessible to everyone, socioeconomic linguistic
differences still stratify their use to exacerbate the digital divide. These
differences underscore the importance of considering SES in developing language
technologies to accommodate varying linguistic needs rooted in socioeconomic
factors and limit the AI Gap across SES groups.

Conclusion: 研究结果对版权案件有重要影响，但并未明确支持任何一方。

Abstract: Plaintiffs and defendants in copyright lawsuits over generative AI often make
sweeping, opposing claims about the extent to which large language models
(LLMs) have memorized plaintiffs' protected expression. Drawing on adversarial
ML and copyright law, we show that these polarized positions dramatically
oversimplify the relationship between memorization and copyright. To do so, we
leverage a recent probabilistic extraction technique to extract pieces of the
Books3 dataset from 13 open-weight LLMs. Through numerous experiments, we show
that it's possible to extract substantial parts of at least some books from
different LLMs. This is evidence that the LLMs have memorized the extracted
text; this memorized content is copied inside the model parameters. But the
results are complicated: the extent of memorization varies both by model and by
book. With our specific experiments, we find that the largest LLMs don't
memorize most books -- either in whole or in part. However, we also find that
Llama 3.1 70B memorizes some books, like Harry Potter and 1984, almost
entirely. We discuss why our results have significant implications for
copyright cases, though not ones that unambiguously favor either side.

critical aspects: (1) Jurisdictional diversity: Patents from different offices
vary in legal and drafting conventions. EPD fills a critical gap by providing a
benchmark for European patents to enable more comprehensive evaluation. (2)
Quality improvement: EPD offers high-quality granted patents with finalized and
legally approved texts, whereas others consist of patent applications that are

Conclusion: GAP框架通过显式建模医疗信息和结合外部知识，显著提升了对话式药物推荐的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Medication recommendations have become an important task in the healthcare
domain, especially in measuring the accuracy and safety of medical dialogue
systems (MDS). Different from the recommendation task based on electronic
health records (EHRs), dialogue-based medication recommendations require
research on the interaction details between patients and doctors, which is
crucial but may not exist in EHRs. Recent advancements in large language models
(LLM) have extended the medical dialogue domain. These LLMs can interpret
patients' intent and provide medical suggestions including medication
recommendations, but some challenges are still worth attention. During a
multi-turn dialogue, LLMs may ignore the fine-grained medical information or
connections across the dialogue turns, which is vital for providing accurate
suggestions. Besides, LLMs may generate non-factual responses when there is a
lack of domain-specific knowledge, which is more risky in the medical domain.
To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{G}raph-\textbf{A}ssisted
\textbf{P}rompts (\textbf{GAP}) framework for dialogue-based medication
recommendation. It extracts medical concepts and corresponding states from
dialogue to construct an explicitly patient-centric graph, which can describe
the neglected but important information. Further, combined with external
medical knowledge graphs, GAP can generate abundant queries and prompts, thus
retrieving information from multiple sources to reduce the non-factual
responses. We evaluate GAP on a dialogue-based medication recommendation
dataset and further explore its potential in a more difficult scenario,
dynamically diagnostic interviewing. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
competitive performance when compared with strong baselines.

Abstract: Legal Passage Retrieval (LPR) systems are crucial as they help practitioners
save time when drafting legal arguments. However, it remains an underexplored
avenue. One primary reason is the significant vocabulary mismatch between the
query and the target passage. To address this, we propose a simple yet
effective method, the Generative query REwriter (GuRE). We leverage the
generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by training the LLM for
query rewriting. "Rewritten queries" help retrievers to retrieve target
passages by mitigating vocabulary mismatch. Experimental results show that GuRE
significantly improves performance in a retriever-agnostic manner,
outperforming all baseline methods. Further analysis reveals that different
training objectives lead to distinct retrieval behaviors, making GuRE more
suitable than direct retriever fine-tuning for real-world applications. Codes
are avaiable at github.com/daehuikim/GuRE.

Conclusion: 通过针对性微调关键注意力头，可有效减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: OpenAI's Whisper has achieved significant success in Automatic Speech
Recognition. However, it has consistently been found to exhibit hallucination
issues, particularly in non-speech segments, which limits its broader
application in complex industrial settings.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel method to reduce Whisper's hallucination
on non-speech segments without using any pre- or post-possessing techniques.
Specifically, we benchmark the contribution of each self-attentional head in
the Whisper-large-v3 decoder to the hallucination problem by performing a
head-wise mask. Our findings reveal that only 3 of the 20 heads account for
over 75% of the hallucinations on the UrbanSound dataset. We then fine-tune
these three crazy heads using a collection of non-speech data. The results show
that our best fine-tuned model, namely Calm-Whisper, achieves over 80%
reduction in non-speech hallucination with only less than 0.1% WER degradation
on LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other.

Abstract: The scope of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation
(IWSLT) has recently broadened beyond traditional Speech Translation (ST) to
encompass a wider array of tasks, including Speech Question Answering and
Summarization. This shift is partly driven by the growing capabilities of
modern systems, particularly with the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
In this paper, we present the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology's submissions
for the Offline ST and Instruction Following (IF) tracks, where we leverage
LLMs to enhance performance across all tasks. For the Offline ST track, we
propose a pipeline that employs multiple automatic speech recognition systems,
whose outputs are fused using an LLM with document-level context. This is
followed by a two-step translation process, incorporating additional refinement
step to improve translation quality. For the IF track, we develop an end-to-end
model that integrates a speech encoder with an LLM to perform a wide range of
instruction-following tasks. We complement it with a final document-level
refinement stage to further enhance output quality by using contextual
information.

Abstract: Adapting to the addressee is crucial for successful explanations, yet poses
significant challenges for dialogsystems. We adopt the approach of treating
explanation generation as a non-stationary decision process, where the optimal
strategy varies according to changing beliefs about the explainee and the
interaction context. In this paper we address the questions of (1) how to track
the interaction context and the relevant listener features in a formally
defined computational partner model, and (2) how to utilize this model in the
dynamically adjusted, rational decision process that determines the currently
best explanation strategy. We propose a Bayesian inference-based approach to
continuously update the partner model based on user feedback, and a
non-stationary Markov Decision Process to adjust decision-making based on the
partner model values. We evaluate an implementation of this framework with five
simulated interlocutors, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to
different partners with constant and even changing feedback behavior. The
results show high adaptivity with distinct explanation strategies emerging for
different partners, highlighting the potential of our approach to improve
explainable AI systems and dialogsystems in general.

Motivation: 当前语音-LLM在上下文推理和副语言理解方面表现有限，缺乏涵盖这两方面的QA数据集。

Method: 提出了一种基于伪副语言标签的数据浓缩和LLM生成的上下文副语言QA（CPQA）生成框架。

Result: 在Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct模型上验证了框架的有效性，结果显示与人工生成的CPQA数据集强相关，但也揭示了语音-LLM在共情推理任务中的局限性。

Conclusion: 该框架是首创，有望用于训练更具鲁棒性的语音-LLM。

Abstract: Current speech-LLMs exhibit limited capability in contextual reasoning
alongside paralinguistic understanding, primarily due to the lack of
Question-Answer (QA) datasets that cover both aspects. We propose a novel
framework for dataset generation from in-the-wild speech data, that integrates
contextual reasoning with paralinguistic information. It consists of a pseudo
paralinguistic label-based data condensation of in-the-wild speech and
LLM-based Contextual Paralinguistic QA (CPQA) generation. The effectiveness is
validated by a strong correlation in evaluations of the Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct
model on a dataset created by our framework and human-generated CPQA dataset.
The results also reveal the speech-LLM's limitations in handling empathetic
reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for such datasets and more robust
models. The proposed framework is first of its kind and has potential in
training more robust speech-LLMs with paralinguistic reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: SMOTExT为数据保护约束下的安全有效学习提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Data scarcity and class imbalance are persistent challenges in training
robust NLP models, especially in specialized domains or low-resource settings.
We propose a novel technique, SMOTExT, that adapts the idea of Synthetic
Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) to textual data. Our method generates new
synthetic examples by interpolating between BERT-based embeddings of two
existing examples and then decoding the resulting latent point into text with
xRAG architecture. By leveraging xRAG's cross-modal retrieval-generation
framework, we can effectively turn interpolated vectors into coherent text.
While this is preliminary work supported by qualitative outputs only, the
method shows strong potential for knowledge distillation and data augmentation
in few-shot settings. Notably, our approach also shows promise for
privacy-preserving machine learning: in early experiments, training models
solely on generated data achieved comparable performance to models trained on
the original dataset. This suggests a viable path toward safe and effective
learning under data protection constraints.

Conclusion: 当前LVLMs在视觉推理任务中存在显著不足，ChartMuseum基准测试能有效区分模型能力。

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a unique challenge for large vision-language
models (LVLMs), as it requires the integration of sophisticated textual and
visual reasoning capabilities. However, current LVLMs exhibit a notable
imbalance between these skills, falling short on visual reasoning that is
difficult to perform in text. We conduct a case study using a synthetic dataset
solvable only through visual reasoning and show that model performance degrades
significantly with increasing visual complexity, while human performance
remains robust. We then introduce ChartMuseum, a new Chart Question Answering
(QA) benchmark containing 1,162 expert-annotated questions spanning multiple
reasoning types, curated from real-world charts across 184 sources,
specifically built to evaluate complex visual and textual reasoning. Unlike
prior chart understanding benchmarks -- where frontier models perform similarly
and near saturation -- our benchmark exposes a substantial gap between model
and human performance, while effectively differentiating model capabilities:
although humans achieve 93% accuracy, the best-performing model Gemini-2.5-Pro
attains only 63.0%, and the leading open-source LVLM Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
achieves only 38.5%. Moreover, on questions requiring primarily visual
reasoning, all models experience a 35%-55% performance drop from
text-reasoning-heavy question performance. Lastly, our qualitative error

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies have transformed
human-computer interaction; however, low-resource languages in Africa remain
significantly underrepresented in both research and practical applications.
This study investigates the major challenges hindering the development of ASR
systems for these languages, which include data scarcity, linguistic
complexity, limited computational resources, acoustic variability, and ethical
concerns surrounding bias and privacy. The primary goal is to critically
analyze these barriers and identify practical, inclusive strategies to advance
ASR technologies within the African context. Recent advances and case studies
emphasize promising strategies such as community-driven data collection,
self-supervised and multilingual learning, lightweight model architectures, and
techniques that prioritize privacy. Evidence from pilot projects involving
various African languages showcases the feasibility and impact of customized
solutions, which encompass morpheme-based modeling and domain-specific ASR
applications in sectors like healthcare and education. The findings highlight
the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and sustained investment to
tackle the distinct linguistic and infrastructural challenges faced by the
continent. This study offers a progressive roadmap for creating ethical,
efficient, and inclusive ASR systems that not only safeguard linguistic
diversity but also improve digital accessibility and promote socioeconomic
participation for speakers of African languages.

Abstract: Multimodal reference resolution, including phrase grounding, aims to
understand the semantic relations between mentions and real-world objects.
Phrase grounding between images and their captions is a well-established task.
In contrast, for real-world applications, it is essential to integrate textual
and multimodal reference resolution to unravel the reference relations within
dialogue, especially in handling ambiguities caused by pronouns and ellipses.
This paper presents a framework that unifies textual and multimodal reference
resolution by mapping mention embeddings to object embeddings and selecting
mentions or objects based on their similarity. Our experiments show that
learning textual reference resolution, such as coreference resolution and
predicate-argument structure analysis, positively affects performance in
multimodal reference resolution. In particular, our model with coreference
resolution performs better in pronoun phrase grounding than representative
models for this task, MDETR and GLIP. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates
that incorporating textual reference relations strengthens the confidence
scores between mentions, including pronouns and predicates, and objects, which
can reduce the ambiguities that arise in visually grounded dialogues.

Abstract: VLM-based mobile agents are increasingly popular due to their capabilities to
interact with smartphone GUIs and XML-structured texts and to complete daily
tasks. However, existing online benchmarks struggle with obtaining stable
reward signals due to dynamic environmental changes. Offline benchmarks
evaluate the agents through single-path trajectories, which stands in contrast
to the inherently multi-solution characteristics of GUI tasks. Additionally,
both types of benchmarks fail to assess whether mobile agents can handle noise
or engage in proactive interactions due to a lack of noisy apps or overly full
instructions during the evaluation process. To address these limitations, we
use a slot-based instruction generation method to construct a more realistic
and comprehensive benchmark named Mobile-Bench-v2. Mobile-Bench-v2 includes a
common task split, with offline multi-path evaluation to assess the agent's
ability to obtain step rewards during task execution. It contains a noisy split
based on pop-ups and ads apps, and a contaminated split named AITZ-Noise to
formulate a real noisy environment. Furthermore, an ambiguous instruction split
with preset Q\&A interactions is released to evaluate the agent's proactive
interaction capabilities. We conduct evaluations on these splits using the
single-agent framework AppAgent-v1, the multi-agent framework Mobile-Agent-v2,
as well as other mobile agents such as UI-Tars and OS-Atlas. Code and data are

Abstract: Counterspeech has proven to be a powerful tool to combat hate speech online.
Previous studies have focused on generating counterspeech conditioned only on
specific intents (single attributed). However, a holistic approach considering
multiple attributes simultaneously can yield more nuanced and effective
responses. Here, we introduce HiPPrO, Hierarchical Prefix learning with
Preference Optimization, a novel two-stage framework that utilizes the
effectiveness of attribute-specific prefix embedding spaces hierarchically
optimized during the counterspeech generation process in the first phase.
Thereafter, we incorporate both reference and reward-free preference
optimization to generate more constructive counterspeech. Furthermore, we
extend IntentCONANv2 by annotating all 13,973 counterspeech instances with
emotion labels by five annotators. HiPPrO leverages hierarchical prefix
optimization to integrate these dual attributes effectively. An extensive
evaluation demonstrates that HiPPrO achieves a ~38 % improvement in intent
conformity and a ~3 %, ~2 %, ~3 % improvement in Rouge-1, Rouge-2, and Rouge-L,
respectively, compared to several baseline models. Human evaluations further
substantiate the superiority of our approach, highlighting the enhanced
relevance and appropriateness of the generated counterspeech. This work
underscores the potential of multi-attribute conditioning in advancing the
efficacy of counterspeech generation systems.

Abstract: Argument mining has garnered increasing attention over the years, with the
recent advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) further propelling this
trend. However, current argument relations remain relatively simplistic and
foundational, struggling to capture the full scope of argument information,
particularly when it comes to representing complex argument structures in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose 14 fine-grained
relation types from both vertical and horizontal dimensions, thereby capturing
the intricate interplay between argument components for a thorough
understanding of argument structure. On this basis, we conducted extensive
experiments on three tasks: argument component detection, relation prediction,
and automated essay grading. Additionally, we explored the impact of writing
quality on argument component detection and relation prediction, as well as the
connections between discourse relations and argumentative features. The
findings highlight the importance of fine-grained argumentative annotations for
argumentative writing quality assessment and encourage multi-dimensional
argument analysis.

Abstract: Content moderation research has recently made significant advances, but still

tasks: abusiveness, sentiment, and topic classification. The dataset comprises
13,717 YouTube comments annotated by nine native speakers, collected from 7,373
videos with a total of over 1.2 billion views across 51 channels. We developed
an iterative term clustering approach for effective data selection. Recognizing
that around 64% of Tigrinya social media content uses Romanized
transliterations rather than native Ge'ez script, our dataset accommodates both
writing systems to reflect actual language use. We establish strong baselines
across the tasks in the benchmark, while leaving significant challenges for
future contributions. Our experiments reveal that small, specialized multi-task

Abstract: Generative AI paraphrased text can be used for copyright infringement and the
AI paraphrased content can deprive substantial revenue from original content
creators. Despite this recent surge of malicious use of generative AI, there
are few academic publications that research this threat. In this article, we
demonstrate the ability of pattern-based similarity detection for AI
paraphrased news recognition. We propose an algorithmic scheme, which is not
limited to detect whether an article is an AI paraphrase, but, more
importantly, to identify that the source of infringement is the ChatGPT. The
proposed method is tested with a benchmark dataset specifically created for
this task that incorporates real articles from BBC, incorporating a total of
2,224 articles across five different news categories, as well as 2,224
paraphrased articles created with ChatGPT. Results show that our pattern
similarity-based method, that makes no use of deep learning, can detect ChatGPT
assisted paraphrased articles at percentages 96.23% for accuracy, 96.25% for
precision, 96.21% for sensitivity, 96.25% for specificity and 96.23% for F1

Motivation: 远监督命名实体识别（DS-NER）是一种低成本的数据标注方法，但不同标注方法间的噪声分布研究较少。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过比较传统规则方法和基于大语言模型的监督方法，并引入新的噪声评估框架，分别解决未标记实体问题（UEP）和噪声实体问题（NEP）。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上显著优于现有方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在DS-NER中表现出色，为噪声分布问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Distantly supervised named entity recognition (DS-NER) has emerged as a cheap
and convenient alternative to traditional human annotation methods, enabling
the automatic generation of training data by aligning text with external
resources. Despite the many efforts in noise measurement methods, few works
focus on the latent noise distribution between different distant annotation
methods. In this work, we explore the effectiveness and robustness of DS-NER by
two aspects: (1) distant annotation techniques, which encompasses both
traditional rule-based methods and the innovative large language model
supervision approach, and (2) noise assessment, for which we introduce a novel
framework. This framework addresses the challenges by distinctly categorizing
them into the unlabeled-entity problem (UEP) and the noisy-entity problem
(NEP), subsequently providing specialized solutions for each. Our proposed
method achieves significant improvements on eight real-world distant
supervision datasets originating from three different data sources and
involving four distinct annotation techniques, confirming its superiority over
current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RE模型的泛化能力受数据质量和基准结构问题（如单关系样本约束）的限制。

Abstract: Analysing the generalisation capabilities of relation extraction (RE) models
is crucial for assessing whether they learn robust relational patterns or rely
on spurious correlations. Our cross-dataset experiments find that RE models
struggle with unseen data, even within similar domains. Notably, higher
intra-dataset performance does not indicate better transferability, instead
often signaling overfitting to dataset-specific artefacts. Our results also
show that data quality, rather than lexical similarity, is key to robust
transfer, and the choice of optimal adaptation strategy depends on the quality
of data available: while fine-tuning yields the best cross-dataset performance
with high-quality data, few-shot in-context learning (ICL) is more effective
with noisier data. However, even in these cases, zero-shot baselines
occasionally outperform all cross-dataset results. Structural issues in RE
benchmarks, such as single-relation per sample constraints and non-standardised
negative class definitions, further hinder model transferability.

Abstract: Code-mixed languages, characterized by frequent within-sentence language

to address. In this work, we propose CMLFormer, an enhanced multi-layer
dual-decoder Transformer with a shared encoder and synchronized decoder
cross-attention, designed to model the linguistic and semantic dynamics of
code-mixed text. CMLFormer is pre-trained on an augmented Hinglish corpus with
switching point and translation annotations with multiple new objectives
specifically aimed at capturing switching behavior, cross-lingual structure,
and code-mixing complexity. Our experiments show that CMLFormer improves F1
score, precision, and accuracy over other approaches on the HASOC-2021
benchmark under select pre-training setups. Attention analyses further show
that it can identify and attend to switching points, validating its sensitivity
to code-mixed structure. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of
CMLFormer's architecture and multi-task pre-training strategy for modeling

1.5M words and corresponding turn-taking and backchannel annotations from
approximately 20M frames. Additionally, we present an end-to-end framework that
predicts the probability of turn-taking and backchannel actions from
multi-modal signals. The proposed model emphasizes the interrelation between
modalities and supports any combination of text, audio, and video inputs,
making it adaptable to a variety of realistic scenarios. Our experiments show
that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on turn-taking and
backchannel prediction tasks, achieving a 10\% increase in F1-score on
turn-taking and a 33\% increase on backchannel prediction. Our dataset and code

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is vital

multimodal fusion, weak generalization, and poor interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose FlightGPT, a novel UAV VLN framework built upon

We design a two-stage training pipeline: first, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
using high-quality demonstrations to improve initialization and structured
reasoning; then, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, guided by
a composite reward that considers goal accuracy, reasoning quality, and format
compliance, to enhance generalization and adaptability. Furthermore, FlightGPT
introduces a Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning mechanism to improve
decision interpretability. Extensive experiments on the city-scale dataset
CityNav demonstrate that FlightGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across
all scenarios, with a 9.22\% higher success rate than the strongest baseline in
unseen environments. Our implementation is publicly available.

Conclusion: 去标识化方法在背景知识充足时可能失效，需进一步改进以提高安全性。

Abstract: Documents revealing sensitive information about individuals must typically be
de-identified. This de-identification is often done by masking all mentions of
personally identifiable information (PII), thereby making it more difficult to
uncover the identity of the person(s) in question. To investigate the
robustness of de-identification methods, we present a novel, RAG-inspired
approach that attempts the reverse process of re-identification based on a
database of documents representing background knowledge. Given a text in which
personal identifiers have been masked, the re-identification proceeds in two
steps. A retriever first selects from the background knowledge passages deemed
relevant for the re-identification. Those passages are then provided to an
infilling model which seeks to infer the original content of each text span.
This process is repeated until all masked spans are replaced. We evaluate the
re-identification on three datasets (Wikipedia biographies, court rulings and
clinical notes). Results show that (1) as many as 80% of de-identified text
spans can be successfully recovered and (2) the re-identification accuracy
increases along with the level of background knowledge.

Abstract: Homograph disambiguation remains a significant challenge in
grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, especially for low-resource languages.
This challenge is twofold: (1) creating balanced and comprehensive homograph
datasets is labor-intensive and costly, and (2) specific disambiguation
strategies introduce additional latency, making them unsuitable for real-time
applications such as screen readers and other accessibility tools. In this
paper, we address both issues. First, we propose a semi-automated pipeline for
constructing homograph-focused datasets, introduce the HomoRich dataset
generated through this pipeline, and demonstrate its effectiveness by applying
it to enhance a state-of-the-art deep learning-based G2P system for Persian.
Second, we advocate for a paradigm shift - utilizing rich offline datasets to
inform the development of fast, rule-based methods suitable for
latency-sensitive accessibility applications like screen readers. To this end,
we improve one of the most well-known rule-based G2P systems, eSpeak, into a
fast homograph-aware version, HomoFast eSpeak. Our results show an approximate
30% improvement in homograph disambiguation accuracy for the deep
learning-based and eSpeak systems.

Conclusion: 推荐SQL RAG和Graph RAG用于机场环境，因其减少幻觉且能处理动态问题。

Abstract: Airports from the top 20 in terms of annual passengers are highly dynamic
environments with thousands of flights daily, and they aim to increase the
degree of automation. To contribute to this, we implemented a Conversational AI
system that enables staff in an airport to communicate with flight information
systems. This system not only answers standard airport queries but also
resolves airport terminology, jargon, abbreviations, and dynamic questions
involving reasoning. In this paper, we built three different
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods, including traditional RAG, SQL
RAG, and Knowledge Graph-based RAG (Graph RAG). Experiments showed that
traditional RAG achieved 84.84% accuracy using BM25 + GPT-4 but occasionally
produced hallucinations, which is risky to airport safety. In contrast, SQL RAG
and Graph RAG achieved 80.85% and 91.49% accuracy respectively, with
significantly fewer hallucinations. Moreover, Graph RAG was especially
effective for questions that involved reasoning. Based on our observations, we
thus recommend SQL RAG and Graph RAG are better for airport environments, due
to fewer hallucinations and the ability to handle dynamic questions.

Abstract: Media bias detection is a critical task in ensuring fair and balanced

of bias and the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this work, we
perform sentence-level bias classification by fine-tuning a RoBERTa-based model
on the expert-annotated BABE dataset. Using McNemar's test and the 5x2
cross-validation paired t-test, we show statistically significant improvements
in performance when comparing our model to a domain-adaptively pre-trained
DA-RoBERTa baseline. Furthermore, attention-based analysis shows that our model
avoids common pitfalls like oversensitivity to politically charged terms and
instead attends more meaningfully to contextually relevant tokens. For a
comprehensive examination of media bias, we present a pipeline that combines
our model with an already-existing bias-type classifier. Our method exhibits
good generalization and interpretability, despite being constrained by
sentence-level analysis and dataset size because of a lack of larger and more
advanced bias corpora. We talk about context-aware modeling, bias
neutralization, and advanced bias type classification as potential future
directions. Our findings contribute to building more robust, explainable, and
socially responsible NLP systems for media bias detection.

Conclusion: topicwizard为模型无关的主题模型解释提供了有效工具，提升了用户对主题模型的理解能力。

Abstract: Topic models are statistical tools that allow their users to gain qualitative
and quantitative insights into the contents of textual corpora without the need
for close reading. They can be applied in a wide range of settings from
discourse analysis, through pretraining data curation, to text filtering. Topic
models are typically parameter-rich, complex models, and interpreting these
parameters can be challenging for their users. It is typical practice for users
to interpret topics based on the top 10 highest ranking terms on a given topic.
This list-of-words approach, however, gives users a limited and biased picture
of the content of topics. Thoughtful user interface design and visualizations
can help users gain a more complete and accurate understanding of topic models'
output. While some visualization utilities do exist for topic models, these are
typically limited to a certain type of topic model. We introduce topicwizard, a
framework for model-agnostic topic model interpretation, that provides
intuitive and interactive tools that help users examine the complex semantic
relations between documents, words and topics learned by topic models.

Abstract: Can deception be detected solely from written text? Cues of deceptive
communication are inherently subtle, even more so in text-only communication.
Yet, prior studies have reported considerable success in automatic deception
detection. We hypothesize that such findings are largely driven by artifacts
introduced during data collection and do not generalize beyond specific
datasets. We revisit this assumption by introducing a belief-based deception
framework, which defines deception as a misalignment between an author's claims
and true beliefs, irrespective of factual accuracy, allowing deception cues to
be studied in isolation. Based on this framework, we construct three corpora,
collectively referred to as DeFaBel, including a German-language corpus of
deceptive and non-deceptive arguments and a multilingual version in German and
English, each collected under varying conditions to account for belief change
and enable cross-linguistic analysis. Using these corpora, we evaluate commonly
reported linguistic cues of deception. Across all three DeFaBel variants, these
cues show negligible, statistically insignificant correlations with deception
labels, contrary to prior work that treats such cues as reliable indicators. We
further benchmark against other English deception datasets following similar
data collection protocols. While some show statistically significant
correlations, effect sizes remain low and, critically, the set of predictive
cues is inconsistent across datasets. We also evaluate deception detection
using feature-based models, pretrained language models, and instruction-tuned
large language models. While some models perform well on established deception
datasets, they consistently perform near chance on DeFaBel. Our findings
challenge the assumption that deception can be reliably inferred from
linguistic cues and call for rethinking how deception is studied and modeled in
NLP.

Abstract: We introduce SLED, an alternative approach to speech language modeling by
encoding speech waveforms into sequences of continuous latent representations
and modeling them autoregressively using an energy distance objective. The
energy distance offers an analytical measure of the distributional gap by
contrasting simulated and target samples, enabling efficient training to
capture the underlying continuous autoregressive distribution. By bypassing
reliance on residual vector quantization, SLED avoids discretization errors and
eliminates the need for the complicated hierarchical architectures common in
existing speech language models. It simplifies the overall modeling pipeline
while preserving the richness of speech information and maintaining inference
efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that SLED achieves strong performance
in both zero-shot and streaming speech synthesis, showing its potential for
broader applications in general-purpose speech language models.

Motivation: 种子科学对现代农业至关重要，但面临资源稀缺和缺乏标准化基准的挑战，限制了LLM的应用。

Method: 开发SeedBench基准，模拟现代育种过程，并评估26种LLM（包括专有、开源和领域微调模型）。

Result: 评估显示LLM在种子科学问题上的表现与实际问题存在显著差距。

Conclusion: SeedBench为LLM在种子设计中的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Seed science is essential for modern agriculture, directly influencing crop
yields and global food security. However, challenges such as interdisciplinary
complexity and high costs with limited returns hinder progress, leading to a
shortage of experts and insufficient technological support. While large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise across various fields, their
application in seed science remains limited due to the scarcity of digital
resources, complex gene-trait relationships, and the lack of standardized
benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce SeedBench -- the first multi-task
benchmark specifically designed for seed science. Developed in collaboration
with domain experts, SeedBench focuses on seed breeding and simulates key
aspects of modern breeding processes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
26 leading LLMs, encompassing proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific
fine-tuned models. Our findings not only highlight the substantial gaps between
the power of LLMs and the real-world seed science problems, but also make a
foundational step for research on LLMs for seed design.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of global digitalization, users from different
countries increasingly rely on social media for information exchange. In this
context, multilingual multi-label emotion detection has emerged as a critical
research area. This study addresses SemEval-2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection. Our paper focuses on two sub-tracks of this task:
(1) Track A: Multi-label emotion detection, and (2) Track B: Emotion intensity.
To tackle multilingual challenges, we leverage pre-trained multilingual models
and focus on two architectures: (1) a fine-tuned BERT-based classification
model and (2) an instruction-tuned generative LLM. Additionally, we propose two
methods for handling multi-label classification: the base method, which maps an
input directly to all its corresponding emotion labels, and the pairwise
method, which models the relationship between the input text and each emotion
category individually. Experimental results demonstrate the strong
generalization ability of our approach in multilingual emotion recognition. In
Track A, our method achieved Top 4 performance across 10 languages, ranking 1st
in Hindi. In Track B, our approach also secured Top 5 performance in 7
languages, highlighting its simplicity and effectiveness\footnote{Our code is

Result: 在四个基准测试和十二个基线方法中，LORex的准确率提高了12%，Wu & Palmer相似度提高了5%。

Conclusion: LORex在分类法扩展任务中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Taxonomies are hierarchical knowledge graphs crucial for recommendation
systems, and web applications. As data grows, expanding taxonomies is
essential, but existing methods face key challenges: (1) discriminative models
struggle with representation limits and generalization, while (2) generative
methods either process all candidates at once, introducing noise and exceeding
context limits, or discard relevant entities by selecting noisy candidates. We
propose LORex ($\textbf{L}$ineage-$\textbf{O}$riented $\textbf{Re}$asoning for
Taxonomy E$\textbf{x}$pansion), a plug-and-play framework that combines
discriminative ranking and generative reasoning for efficient taxonomy
expansion. Unlike prior methods, LORex ranks and chunks candidate terms into
batches, filtering noise and iteratively refining selections by reasoning
candidates' hierarchy to ensure contextual efficiency. Extensive experiments
across four benchmarks and twelve baselines show that LORex improves accuracy
by 12% and Wu & Palmer similarity by 5% over state-of-the-art methods.

scarcity. To address this, we present Granary, a large-scale collection of
speech datasets for recognition and translation across 25 European languages.
This is the first open-source effort at this scale for both transcription and
translation. We enhance data quality using a pseudo-labeling pipeline with
segmentation, two-pass inference, hallucination filtering, and punctuation
restoration. We further generate translation pairs from pseudo-labeled
transcriptions using EuroLLM, followed by a data filtration pipeline. Designed
for efficiency, our pipeline processes vast amount of data within hours. We
assess models trained on processed data by comparing their performance on

Result: 人类依赖狭窄且易误导的线索，而LLMs的特征更丰富且接近临床模式，但两者均易漏诊。

Conclusion: 通过可解释框架帮助非专家识别重要语言特征。

Abstract: Cognitive decline often surfaces in language years before diagnosis. It is
frequently non-experts, such as those closest to the patient, who first sense a
change and raise concern. As LLMs become integrated into daily communication
and used over prolonged periods, it may even be an LLM that notices something
is off. But what exactly do they notice--and should be noticing--when making
that judgment? This paper investigates how dementia is perceived through
language by non-experts. We presented transcribed picture descriptions to
non-expert humans and LLMs, asking them to intuitively judge whether each text
was produced by someone healthy or with dementia. We introduce an explainable
method that uses LLMs to extract high-level, expert-guided features
representing these picture descriptions, and use logistic regression to model
human and LLM perceptions and compare with clinical diagnoses. Our analysis
reveals that human perception of dementia is inconsistent and relies on a
narrow, and sometimes misleading, set of cues. LLMs, by contrast, draw on a
richer, more nuanced feature set that aligns more closely with clinical
patterns. Still, both groups show a tendency toward false negatives, frequently
overlooking dementia cases. Through our interpretable framework and the
insights it provides, we hope to help non-experts better recognize the
linguistic signs that matter.

Abstract: We introduce MMAR, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the deep reasoning
capabilities of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) across massive multi-disciplinary
tasks. MMAR comprises 1,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer
triplets, collected from real-world internet videos and refined through
iterative error corrections and quality checks to ensure high quality. Unlike
existing benchmarks that are limited to specific domains of sound, music, or
speech, MMAR extends them to a broad spectrum of real-world audio scenarios,
including mixed-modality combinations of sound, music, and speech. Each
question in MMAR is hierarchically categorized across four reasoning layers:
Signal, Perception, Semantic, and Cultural, with additional sub-categories
within each layer to reflect task diversity and complexity. To further foster
research in this area, we annotate every question with a Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
rationale to promote future advancements in audio reasoning. Each item in the
benchmark demands multi-step deep reasoning beyond surface-level understanding.
Moreover, a part of the questions requires graduate-level perceptual and
domain-specific knowledge, elevating the benchmark's difficulty and depth. We
evaluate MMAR using a broad set of models, including Large Audio-Language
Models (LALMs), Large Audio Reasoning Models (LARMs), Omni Language Models
(OLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), with
audio caption inputs. The performance of these models on MMAR highlights the
benchmark's challenging nature, and our analysis further reveals critical
limitations of understanding and reasoning capabilities among current models.
We hope MMAR will serve as a catalyst for future advances in this important but
little-explored area.

Abstract: We present a family of encodings for sequence labeling dependency parsing,
based on the concept of hierarchical bracketing. We prove that the existing
4-bit projective encoding belongs to this family, but it is suboptimal in the
number of labels used to encode a tree. We derive an optimal hierarchical
bracketing, which minimizes the number of symbols used and encodes projective
trees using only 12 distinct labels (vs. 16 for the 4-bit encoding). We also
extend optimal hierarchical bracketing to support arbitrary non-projectivity in
a more compact way than previous encodings. Our new encodings yield competitive
accuracy on a diverse set of treebanks.

Abstract: In this study, we approach morphological productivity from two perspectives:
a cognitive-computational perspective, and a diachronic perspective zooming in
on an actual speaker, Thomas Mann. For developing the first perspective, we
make use of a cognitive computational model of the mental lexicon, the
discriminative lexicon model. For computational mappings between form and
meaning to be productive, in the sense that novel, previously unencountered
words, can be understood and produced, there must be systematicities between
the form space and the semantic space. If the relation between form and meaning
would be truly arbitrary, a model could memorize form and meaning pairings, but
there is no way in which the model would be able to generalize to novel test
data. For Finnish nominal inflection, Malay derivation, and English
compounding, we explore, using the Discriminative Lexicon Model as a
computational tool, to trace differences in the degree to which inflectional
and word formation patterns are productive. We show that the DLM tends to
associate affix-like sublexical units with the centroids of the embeddings of
the words with a given affix. For developing the second perspective, we study
how the intake and output of one prolific writer, Thomas Mann, changes over
time. We show by means of an examination of what Thomas Mann is likely to have
read, and what he wrote, that the rate at which Mann produces novel derived
words is extremely low. There are far more novel words in his input than in his
output. We show that Thomas Mann is less likely to produce a novel derived word
with a given suffix the greater the average distance is of the embeddings of
all derived words to the corresponding centroid, and discuss the challenges of
using speaker-specific embeddings for low-frequency and novel words.

Abstract: Inverse Protein Folding (IPF) is a critical subtask in the field of protein
design, aiming to engineer amino acid sequences capable of folding correctly
into a specified three-dimensional (3D) conformation. Although substantial
progress has been achieved in recent years, existing methods generally rely on
either backbone coordinates or molecular surface features alone, which
restricts their ability to fully capture the complex chemical and geometric
constraints necessary for precise sequence prediction. To address this
limitation, we present DS-ProGen, a dual-structure deep language model for
functional protein design, which integrates both backbone geometry and
surface-level representations. By incorporating backbone coordinates as well as
surface chemical and geometric descriptors into a next-amino-acid prediction
paradigm, DS-ProGen is able to generate functionally relevant and structurally
stable sequences while satisfying both global and local conformational
constraints. On the PRIDE dataset, DS-ProGen attains the current
state-of-the-art recovery rate of 61.47%, demonstrating the synergistic
advantage of multi-modal structural encoding in protein design. Furthermore,
DS-ProGen excels in predicting interactions with a variety of biological

Conclusion: TrafficSafe为交通安全研究提供了突破性方法，将AI技术转化为实际应用。

Abstract: Predicting crash events is crucial for understanding crash distributions and
their contributing factors, thereby enabling the design of proactive traffic
safety policy interventions. However, existing methods struggle to interpret
the complex interplay among various sources of traffic crash data, including
numeric characteristics, textual reports, crash imagery, environmental
conditions, and driver behavior records. As a result, they often fail to
capture the rich semantic information and intricate interrelationships embedded
in these diverse data sources, limiting their ability to identify critical
crash risk factors. In this research, we propose TrafficSafe, a framework that
adapts LLMs to reframe crash prediction and feature attribution as text-based
reasoning. A multi-modal crash dataset including 58,903 real-world reports
together with belonged infrastructure, environmental, driver, and vehicle
information is collected and textualized into TrafficSafe Event Dataset. By
customizing and fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset, the TrafficSafe LLM achieves
a 42% average improvement in F1-score over baselines. To interpret these
predictions and uncover contributing factors, we introduce TrafficSafe
Attribution, a sentence-level feature attribution framework enabling
conditional risk analysis. Findings show that alcohol-impaired driving is the
leading factor in severe crashes, with aggressive and impairment-related
behaviors having nearly twice the contribution for severe crashes compared to
other driver behaviors. Furthermore, TrafficSafe Attribution highlights pivotal
features during model training, guiding strategic crash data collection for
iterative performance improvements. The proposed TrafficSafe offers a
transformative leap in traffic safety research, providing a blueprint for
translating advanced AI technologies into responsible, actionable, and
life-saving outcomes.

Conclusion: taggedPBC是支持基于语料库的跨语言研究的重要一步，数据集已开源供研究使用。

Abstract: Existing datasets available for crosslinguistic investigations have tended to
focus on large amounts of data for a small group of languages or a small amount
of data for a large number of languages. This means that claims based on these
datasets are limited in what they reveal about universal properties of the
human language faculty. While this has begun to change through the efforts of
projects seeking to develop tagged corpora for a large number of languages,
such efforts are still constrained by limits on resources. The current paper
reports on a large automatically tagged parallel dataset which has been
developed to partially address this issue. The taggedPBC contains more than
1,800 sentences of pos-tagged parallel text data from over 1,500 languages,
representing 133 language families and 111 isolates, dwarfing previously
available resources. The accuracy of tags in this dataset is shown to correlate
well with both existing SOTA taggers for high-resource languages (SpaCy,
Trankit) as well as hand-tagged corpora (Universal Dependencies Treebanks).
Additionally, a novel measure derived from this dataset, the N1 ratio,
correlates with expert determinations of word order in three typological
databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp) such that a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier
trained on this feature can accurately identify basic word order for languages
not in those databases. While much work is still needed to expand and develop
this dataset, the taggedPBC is an important step to enable corpus-based
crosslinguistic investigations, and is made available for research and
collaboration via GitHub.

treatment-seeking and recovery. Existing resources for training neural models
to finely classify such stigma are limited, relying primarily on social-media
or synthetic data without theoretical underpinnings. To remedy this gap, we
present an expert-annotated, theory-informed corpus of human-chatbot
interviews, comprising 4,141 snippets from 684 participants with documented
socio-cultural backgrounds. Our experiments benchmark state-of-the-art neural
models and empirically unpack the challenges of stigma detection. This dataset
can facilitate research on computationally detecting, neutralizing, and
counteracting mental-health stigma.

Abstract: Morphological parsing is the task of decomposing words into morphemes, the
smallest units of meaning in a language, and labelling their grammatical roles.
It is a particularly challenging task for agglutinative languages, such as the
Nguni languages of South Africa, which construct words by concatenating
multiple morphemes. A morphological parsing system can be framed as a pipeline
with two separate components, a segmenter followed by a tagger. This paper
investigates the use of neural methods to build morphological taggers for the
four Nguni languages. We compare two classes of approaches: training neural
sequence labellers (LSTMs and neural CRFs) from scratch and finetuning
pretrained language models. We compare performance across these two categories,
as well as to a traditional rule-based morphological parser. Neural taggers
comfortably outperform the rule-based baseline and models trained from scratch
tend to outperform pretrained models. We also compare parsing results across
different upstream segmenters and with varying linguistic input features. Our
findings confirm the viability of employing neural taggers based on
pre-existing morphological segmenters for the Nguni languages.

Motivation: 传统概念识别方法无法捕捉文本中未明确提及的复杂概念，MA-COIR旨在通过索引化和LLM增强解决这一问题。

Conclusion: MA-COIR为生物医学领域的概念识别提供了高效且低资源依赖的解决方案。

Abstract: Recognizing biomedical concepts in the text is vital for ontology refinement,
knowledge graph construction, and concept relationship discovery. However,
traditional concept recognition methods, relying on explicit mention
identification, often fail to capture complex concepts not explicitly stated in
the text. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MA-COIR, a framework that
reformulates concept recognition as an indexing-recognition task. By assigning
semantic search indexes (ssIDs) to concepts, MA-COIR resolves ambiguities in
ontology entries and enhances recognition efficiency. Using a pretrained
BART-based model fine-tuned on small datasets, our approach reduces
computational requirements to facilitate adoption by domain experts.
Furthermore, we incorporate large language models (LLMs)-generated queries and
synthetic data to improve recognition in low-resource settings. Experimental
results on three scenarios (CDR, HPO, and HOIP) highlight the effectiveness of
MA-COIR in recognizing both explicit and implicit concepts without the need for
mention-level annotations during inference, advancing ontology-driven concept
recognition in biomedical domain applications. Our code and constructed data
are available at https://github.com/sl-633/macoir-master.

Additionally, handcrafted acoustic features -- including MFCCs, spectral

fusion strategies: early concatenation, modality-specific processing, and
weighted attention with mixup regularization. Results show that weighted
attention provided the best generalization, achieving 69% accuracy on the
development set, though a performance gap between development and test sets
highlights generalization challenges. Our findings, strictly tied to the
MINI-KID framework, emphasize the importance of refining embedding
representations and fusion mechanisms to enhance classification reliability.

Abstract: Natural medicines, particularly Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), are
gaining global recognition for their therapeutic potential in addressing human
symptoms and diseases. TCM, with its systematic theories and extensive
practical experience, provides abundant resources for healthcare. However, the
effective application of TCM requires precise syndrome diagnosis, determination
of treatment principles, and prescription formulation, which demand decades of
clinical expertise. Despite advancements in TCM-based decision systems, machine
learning, and deep learning research, limitations in data and single-objective
constraints hinder their practical application. In recent years, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in complex tasks, but lack
specialization in TCM and face significant challenges, such as too big model
scale to deploy and issues with hallucination. To address these challenges, we
introduce Tianyi with 7.6-billion-parameter LLM, a model scale proper and
specifically designed for TCM, pre-trained and fine-tuned on diverse TCM
corpora, including classical texts, expert treatises, clinical records, and
knowledge graphs. Tianyi is designed to assimilate interconnected and
systematic TCM knowledge through a progressive learning manner. Additionally,
we establish TCMEval, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, to assess LLMs in
TCM examinations, clinical tasks, domain-specific question-answering, and
real-world trials. The extensive evaluations demonstrate the significant
potential of Tianyi as an AI assistant in TCM clinical practice and research,
bridging the gap between TCM knowledge and practical application.

Abstract: Classical Chinese poetry is a vital and enduring part of Chinese literature,

framework for classical Chinese poetry sentiment analysis. We extract
sentence-level audio features from the poetry and incorporate audio from
multiple dialects,which may retain regional ancient Chinese phonetic features,
enriching the phonetic representation. Additionally, we generate sentence-level
visual features, and the multimodal features are fused with textual features
enhanced by LLM translation through multimodal contrastive representation
learning. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public

We propose steering hate speech research and researchers away from pre-existing
computational solutions and consider social methods to inform social solutions
to address this social problem. In a similar way linguistics research can
inform language planning policy, linguists should apply what we know about
language and society to mitigate some of the emergent risks and dangers of
anti-social behaviour in digital spaces. We argue linguists and NLP researchers

Result: 频谱和自监督语音表征在编码韵律方面优于基频特征，尤其是同一说话者的反馈；对比学习可进一步优化表征与人类感知的对齐。

Conclusion: 语音反馈的韵律相似性可通过特定表征方法有效捕捉，对比学习可进一步提升其与人类感知的一致性。

Abstract: Vocal feedback (e.g., `mhm', `yeah', `okay') is an important component of
spoken dialogue and is crucial to ensuring common ground in conversational
systems. The exact meaning of such feedback is conveyed through both lexical
and prosodic form. In this work, we investigate the perceived prosodic
similarity of vocal feedback with the same lexical form, and to what extent
existing speech representations reflect such similarities. A triadic comparison
task with recruited participants is used to measure perceived similarity of
feedback responses taken from two different datasets. We find that spectral and
self-supervised speech representations encode prosody better than extracted
pitch features, especially in the case of feedback from the same speaker. We
also find that it is possible to further condense and align the representations
to human perception through contrastive learning.

Result: SGD训练的网络表现出FER，而进化网络接近UFR，表明训练方法显著影响内部表示。

Conclusion: 理解并缓解FER对表示学习的未来发展至关重要。

Abstract: Much of the excitement in modern AI is driven by the observation that scaling
up existing systems leads to better performance. But does better performance
necessarily imply better internal representations? While the representational
optimist assumes it must, this position paper challenges that view. We compare
neural networks evolved through an open-ended search process to networks
trained via conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the simple task
of generating a single image. This minimal setup offers a unique advantage:
each hidden neuron's full functional behavior can be easily visualized as an
image, thus revealing how the network's output behavior is internally
constructed neuron by neuron. The result is striking: while both networks
produce the same output behavior, their internal representations differ
dramatically. The SGD-trained networks exhibit a form of disorganization that
we term fractured entangled representation (FER). Interestingly, the evolved
networks largely lack FER, even approaching a unified factored representation
(UFR). In large models, FER may be degrading core model capacities like
generalization, creativity, and (continual) learning. Therefore, understanding
and mitigating FER could be critical to the future of representation learning.

Conclusion: CoSO通过动态子空间优化有效解决了持续学习中的遗忘问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to learn multiple tasks sequentially while preserving
prior knowledge, but faces the challenge of catastrophic forgetting when
acquiring new knowledge. Recently, approaches leveraging pre-trained models
have gained increasing popularity to mitigate this issue, due to the strong
generalization ability of foundation models. To adjust pre-trained models for
new tasks, existing methods usually employ low-rank adaptation, which restricts
parameter updates to a fixed low-rank subspace. However, constraining the
optimization space inherently compromises the model's learning capacity,
resulting in inferior performance. To address the limitation, we propose
Continuous Subspace Optimization for Continual Learning (CoSO) to fine-tune the
model in a series of subspaces rather than a single one. These sequential
subspaces are dynamically determined through the singular value decomposition
of gradients. CoSO updates the model by projecting gradients into these
subspaces, ensuring memory-efficient optimization. To mitigate forgetting, the
optimization subspaces of each task are set to be orthogonal to the historical
task subspace. During task learning, CoSO maintains a task-specific component
that captures the critical update directions associated with the current task.
Upon completing a task, this component is used to update the historical task
subspace, laying the groundwork for subsequent learning. Extensive experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate that CoSO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with long task
sequences.

Result: 在GLUE和图像分类任务中，SRLoRA收敛更快且准确率更高。

Conclusion: SRLoRA是一种高效且通用的PEFT方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) method that injects two trainable low-rank matrices (A and
B) into frozen pretrained models. While efficient, LoRA constrains updates to a
fixed low-rank subspace (Delta W = BA), which can limit representational
capacity and hinder downstream performance. We introduce Subspace Recomposition
in Low-Rank Adaptation (SRLoRA) via importance-based fusion and
reinitialization, a novel approach that enhances LoRA's expressiveness without
compromising its lightweight structure. SRLoRA assigns importance scores to
each LoRA pair (a column of B and the corresponding row of A), and dynamically
recomposes the subspace during training. Less important pairs are fused into
the frozen backbone, freeing capacity to reinitialize new pairs along unused
principal directions derived from the pretrained weight's singular value
decomposition. This mechanism enables continual subspace refreshment and richer
adaptation over time, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. We
evaluate SRLoRA on both language and vision tasks, including the GLUE benchmark
and various image classification datasets. SRLoRA consistently achieves faster
convergence and improved accuracy over standard LoRA, demonstrating its
generality, efficiency, and potential for broader PEFT applications.

Conclusion: VIDEORFT通过创新的数据集生成和奖励设计，显著提升了MLLMs的视频推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has shown great promise in achieving
humanlevel reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), and has
recently been extended to MLLMs. Nevertheless, reasoning about videos, which is
a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, remains a persistent challenge due
to the complex logic, temporal and causal structures inherent in video data. To
fill this gap, we propose VIDEORFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT
paradigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.
VIDEORFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement
learning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in
the video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT
datasets. We address this by building a fully automatic CoT curation pipeline.
First, we devise a cognitioninspired prompting strategy to elicit a reasoning
LLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich, structured, and literal
representations of video content. Subsequently, these CoTs are revised by a
visual-language model conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual
consistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two
new datasets - VideoRFT-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To
further strength the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward
that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning with visual
evidence. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent, context-aware
reasoning outputs grounded in visual input. Extensive experiments show that
VIDEORFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six video reasoning
benchmarks.

Abstract: Efficiently adapting large foundation models is critical, especially with
tight compute and memory budgets. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
methods such as LoRA offer limited granularity and effectiveness in
few-parameter regimes. We propose Wavelet Fine-Tuning (WaveFT), a novel PEFT
method that learns highly sparse updates in the wavelet domain of residual
matrices. WaveFT allows precise control of trainable parameters, offering
fine-grained capacity adjustment and excelling with remarkably low parameter
count, potentially far fewer than LoRA's minimum -- ideal for extreme
parameter-efficient scenarios. In order to demonstrate the effect of the
wavelet transform, we compare WaveFT with a special case, called SHiRA, that
entails applying sparse updates directly in the weight domain. Evaluated on
personalized text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion XL as baseline,
WaveFT significantly outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods, especially at low
parameter counts; achieving superior subject fidelity, prompt alignment, and
image diversity.

Abstract: Recent State Space Models (SSM), especially Mamba, have demonstrated
impressive performance in visual modeling and possess superior model
efficiency. However, the application of Mamba to visual tasks suffers inferior
performance due to three main constraints existing in the sequential model: 1)
Casual computing is incapable of accessing global context; 2) Long-range
forgetting when computing the current hidden states; 3) Weak spatial structural
modeling due to the transformed sequential input. To address these issues, we
investigate a simple yet powerful vision task Adaptor for Mamba models, which
consists of two functional modules: Adaptor-T and Adaptor-S. When solving the
hidden states for SSM, we apply a lightweight prediction module Adaptor-T to
select a set of learnable locations as memory augmentations to ease long-range
forgetting issues. Moreover, we leverage Adapator-S, composed of multi-scale
dilated convolutional kernels, to enhance the spatial modeling and introduce
the image inductive bias into the feature output. Both modules can enlarge the
context modeling in casual computing, as the output is enhanced by the
inaccessible features. We explore three usages of Mamba-Adaptor: A general
visual backbone for various vision tasks; A booster module to raise the
performance of pretrained backbones; A highly efficient fine-tuning module that
adapts the base model for transfer learning tasks. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of Mamba-Adaptor in three settings. Notably, our
Mamba-Adaptor achieves state-of the-art performance on the ImageNet and COCO

Conclusion: FLASH通过优化视觉令牌处理，显著提升多模态模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Large language and multimodal models (LLMs and LMMs) exhibit strong inference
capabilities but are often limited by slow decoding speeds. This challenge is
especially acute in LMMs, where visual inputs typically comprise more tokens
with lower information density than text -- an issue exacerbated by recent
trends toward finer-grained visual tokenizations to boost performance.
Speculative decoding has been effective in accelerating LLM inference by using
a smaller draft model to generate candidate tokens, which are then selectively
verified by the target model, improving speed without sacrificing output
quality. While this strategy has been extended to LMMs, existing methods
largely overlook the unique properties of visual inputs and depend solely on
text-based draft models. In this work, we propose \textbf{FLASH} (Fast
Latent-Aware Semi-Autoregressive Heuristics), a speculative decoding framework
designed specifically for LMMs, which leverages two key properties of
multimodal data to design the draft model. First, to address redundancy in
visual tokens, we propose a lightweight latent-aware token compression
mechanism. Second, recognizing that visual objects often co-occur within a
scene, we employ a semi-autoregressive decoding strategy to generate multiple
tokens per forward pass. These innovations accelerate draft decoding while
maintaining high acceptance rates, resulting in faster overall inference.
Experiments show that FLASH significantly outperforms prior speculative
decoding approaches in both unimodal and multimodal settings, achieving up to
\textbf{2.68$\times$} speed-up on video captioning and \textbf{2.55$\times$} on
visual instruction tuning tasks compared to the original LMM.

Abstract: Transformers have transformed modern machine learning, driving breakthroughs
in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. At the core of
their success lies the attention mechanism, which enables the modeling of
global dependencies among input tokens. However, we reveal that the attention
block in transformers suffers from inherent ill-conditioning, which hampers
gradient-based optimization and leads to inefficient training. To address this,
we develop a theoretical framework that establishes a direct relationship
between the conditioning of the attention block and that of the embedded
tokenized data. Building on this insight, we introduce conditioned embedded
tokens, a method that systematically modifies the embedded tokens to improve
the conditioning of the attention mechanism. Our analysis demonstrates that
this approach significantly mitigates ill-conditioning, leading to more stable
and efficient training. We validate our methodology across various transformer
architectures, achieving consistent improvements in image classification,
object detection, instance segmentation, and natural language processing,
highlighting its broad applicability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in many direct multimodal tasks but
struggle to translate this prowess into effective decision-making within
interactive, visually rich environments like games. This ``knowing-doing'' gap
significantly limits their potential as autonomous agents, as leading VLMs
often performing badly in simple games. To address this, we introduce VLM-Gym,
a curated reinforcement learning (RL) environment featuring diverse visual
games with unified interfaces and adjustable, compositional difficulty,
specifically designed for scalable multi-game parallel training. Leveraging
VLM-Gym, we train G0 models using pure RL-driven self-evolution, which
demonstrate emergent perception and reasoning patterns. To further mitigate
challenges arising from game diversity, we develop G1 models. G1 incorporates a
perception-enhanced cold start prior to RL fine-tuning. Our resulting G1 models
consistently surpass their teacher across all games and outperform leading
proprietary models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking. Systematic analysis reveals
an intriguing finding: perception and reasoning abilities mutually bootstrap
each other throughout the RL training process. Source code including VLM-Gym

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) raises
safety concerns under potential malicious inputs. However, existing multimodal
safety evaluations primarily focus on model vulnerabilities exposed by static
image inputs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of video that may induce distinct
safety risks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under
video-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48
fine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a
harmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears
harmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To
generate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a
controllable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what
is shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of
query-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful
outputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the
confidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration.
Extensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average
attack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to
video-induced attacks. We believe Video-SafetyBench will catalyze future
research into video-based safety evaluation and defense strategies.

Abstract: Visual instruction tuning aims to enable large language models to comprehend

vision-to-language projection. However, existing methods often grapple with the
intractable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we
present LLaVA-Meteor, a novel approach designed to break this deadlock,
equipped with a novel Top-Down Compression paradigm that strategically
compresses visual tokens without compromising core information. Specifically,
we construct a trainable Flash Global Fusion module based on efficient
selective state space operators, which aligns the feature space while enabling
each token to perceive holistic visual context and instruction preference at
low cost. Furthermore, a local-to-single scanning manner is employed to
effectively capture local dependencies, thereby enhancing the model's
capability in vision modeling. To alleviate computational overhead, we explore
a Visual-Native Selection mechanism that independently assesses token
significance by both the visual and native experts, followed by aggregation to
retain the most critical subset. Extensive experiments show that our approach
reduces visual tokens by 75--95% while achieving comparable or superior
performance across 12 benchmarks, significantly improving efficiency.

Abstract: Autoregressive transformers have recently shown impressive image generation
quality and efficiency on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models. Unlike
diffusion architectures, autoregressive models can naturally incorporate
arbitrary modalities into a single, unified token sequence--offering a concise
solution for multi-conditional image generation tasks. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{ContextAR}$, a flexible and effective framework for multi-conditional
image generation. ContextAR embeds diverse conditions (e.g., canny edges, depth
maps, poses) directly into the token sequence, preserving modality-specific
semantics. To maintain spatial alignment while enhancing discrimination among
different condition types, we introduce hybrid positional encodings that fuse
Rotary Position Embedding with Learnable Positional Embedding. We design
Conditional Context-aware Attention to reduces computational complexity while
preserving effective intra-condition perception. Without any fine-tuning,
ContextAR supports arbitrary combinations of conditions during inference time.
Experimental results demonstrate the powerful controllability and versatility
of our approach, and show that the competitive perpormance than diffusion-based
multi-conditional control approaches the existing autoregressive baseline

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly improved

develop a scalable, automated pipeline to convert it into multimodal samples.
First, we design prompt templates to steer GPT-Image-1 to generate images with
diverse backgrounds, interleaved text-illustration layouts, and varied fonts,
ensuring contextual relevance and visual realism. Then, the generated images
are manually verified, with low-quality examples discarded. We evaluate a range
of representative open-source and proprietary LMMs under both Chain-of-Thought

insights, such as the impact of test-time scaling, input modality differences,
and sensitivity to visual-text orientation. Notably, LMMs still lag in
multimodal reasoning compared to text-only inputs, indicating that they have
not fully bridged visual reading with reasoning. We hope LogicOCR will serve as

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
video understanding.However, hallucination, where the model generates plausible
yet incorrect outputs, persists as a significant and under-addressed challenge
in the video domain. Among existing solutions, activation engineering has
proven successful in mitigating hallucinations in LLMs and ImageLLMs, yet its
applicability to VideoLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we are the
first to systematically investigate the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms
of activation engineering for mitigating hallucinations in VideoLLMs. We
initially conduct an investigation of the key factors affecting the performance
of activation engineering and find that a model's sensitivity to hallucination
depends on $\textbf{temporal variation}$ rather than task type. Moreover,
selecting appropriate internal modules and dataset for activation engineering
is critical for reducing hallucination. Guided by these findings, we propose a
temporal-aware activation engineering framework for VideoLLMs, which adaptively
identifies and manipulates hallucination-sensitive modules based on the
temporal variation characteristic, substantially mitigating hallucinations
without additional LLM fine-tuning. Experiments across multiple models and
benchmarks demonstrate that our method markedly reduces hallucination in
VideoLLMs, thereby validating the robustness of our findings.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve remarkable performance within the
domain of image generation through the incorporation of the transformer
architecture. Conventionally, DiTs are constructed by stacking serial isotropic
global information modeling transformers, which face significant computational
cost when processing high-resolution images. We empirically analyze that latent
space image generation does not exhibit a strong dependence on global
information as traditionally assumed. Most of the layers in the model
demonstrate redundancy in global computation. In addition, conventional
attention mechanisms exhibit low-frequency inertia issues. To address these
issues, we propose \textbf{P}seudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{W}indow
\textbf{A}ttention (PSWA), which fundamentally mitigates global model
redundancy. PSWA achieves intermediate global-local information interaction
through window attention, while employing a high-frequency bridging branch to
simulate shifted window operations, supplementing appropriate global and
high-frequency information. Furthermore, we propose the Progressive Coverage
Channel Allocation(PCCA) strategy that captures high-order attention similarity
without additional computational cost. Building upon all of them, we propose a
series of Pseudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{Win}dow DiTs (\textbf{Swin DiT}),
accompanied by extensive experiments demonstrating their superior performance.
For example, our proposed Swin-DiT-L achieves a 54%$\uparrow$ FID improvement

the U-shaped difficulty distribution of two given datasets using the base model

or extremely difficult to provide meaningful gradients and perform subsequent
two-stage training. Second, we implement an online advantage differentiation,
computing group-wise empirical accuracy as a difficulty proxy to adaptively
reweight advantages estimation, providing stronger learning signals for more
challenging problems. Finally, we introduce difficulty hints as explicit
prompts for more complex samples in the second training stage, encouraging the
model to calibrate its reasoning depth and perform reflective validation
checks. Our comprehensive approach demonstrates significant performances across

Motivation: 传统视频扩散模型的3D注意力机制计算复杂度高，限制了模型的扩展性。研究发现注意力主要集中在少数关键位置，因此提出稀疏注意力以提升效率。

Result: VSA在60M至1.4B参数的DiTs上实验，训练FLOPs减少2.53倍，扩散损失无下降；实际应用中注意力时间加速6倍，生成时间从31秒降至18秒。

Conclusion: VSA证明稀疏注意力是替代全注意力的实用方案，为视频扩散模型的进一步扩展提供了关键支持。

Abstract: Scaling video diffusion transformers (DiTs) is limited by their quadratic 3D
attention, even though most of the attention mass concentrates on a small
subset of positions. We turn this observation into VSA, a trainable,
hardware-efficient sparse attention that replaces full attention at \emph{both}
training and inference. In VSA, a lightweight coarse stage pools tokens into
tiles and identifies high-weight \emph{critical tokens}; a fine stage computes
token-level attention only inside those tiles subjecting to block computing
layout to ensure hard efficiency. This leads to a single differentiable kernel
that trains end-to-end, requires no post-hoc profiling, and sustains 85\% of
FlashAttention3 MFU. We perform a large sweep of ablation studies and
scaling-law experiments by pretraining DiTs from 60M to 1.4B parameters. VSA
reaches a Pareto point that cuts training FLOPS by 2.53$\times$ with no drop in
diffusion loss. Retrofitting the open-source Wan-2.1 model speeds up attention
time by 6$\times$ and lowers end-to-end generation time from 31s to 18s with
comparable quality. These results establish trainable sparse attention as a
practical alternative to full attention and a key enabler for further scaling

Abstract: Document retrieval is an important task for search and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have contributed to
improving the accuracy of text-based document retrieval. However, documents
with complex layout and visual elements like tables, charts and infographics
are not perfectly represented in textual format. Recently, image-based document
retrieval pipelines have become popular, which use visual large language models
(VLMs) to retrieve relevant page images given a query. Current evaluation
benchmarks on visual document retrieval are limited, as they primarily focus
only English language, rely on synthetically generated questions and offer a
small corpus size. Therefore, we introduce MIRACL-VISION, a multilingual visual
document retrieval evaluation benchmark. MIRACL-VISION covers 18 languages, and
is an extension of the MIRACL dataset, a popular benchmark to evaluate
text-based multilingual retrieval pipelines. MIRACL was built using a
human-intensive annotation process to generate high-quality questions. In order
to reduce MIRACL-VISION corpus size to make evaluation more compute friendly
while keeping the datasets challenging, we have designed a method for
eliminating the "easy" negatives from the corpus. We conducted extensive
experiments comparing MIRACL-VISION with other benchmarks, using popular public
text and image models. We observe a gap in state-of-the-art VLM-based embedding
models on multilingual capabilities, with up to 59.7% lower retrieval accuracy
than a text-based retrieval models. Even for the English language, the visual
models retrieval accuracy is 12.1% lower compared to text-based models.
MIRACL-VISION is a challenging, representative, multilingual evaluation
benchmark for visual retrieval pipelines and will help the community build
robust models for document retrieval.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have shown exceptional performance in visual
generation but incur high computational costs. Token reduction techniques that
compress models by sharing the denoising process among similar tokens have been
introduced. However, existing approaches neglect the denoising priors of the
diffusion models, leading to suboptimal acceleration and diminished image
quality. This study proposes a novel concept: attend to prune feature
redundancies in areas not attended by the diffusion process. We analyze the
location and degree of feature redundancies based on the structure-then-detail
denoising priors. Subsequently, we introduce SDTM, a structure-then-detail
token merging approach that dynamically compresses feature redundancies.
Specifically, we design dynamic visual token merging, compression ratio
adjusting, and prompt reweighting for different stages. Served in a
post-training way, the proposed method can be integrated seamlessly into any
DiT architecture. Extensive experiments across various backbones, schedulers,
and datasets showcase the superiority of our method, for example, it achieves
1.55 times acceleration with negligible impact on image quality. Project page:

Abstract: Robustness against uncertain and ambiguous inputs is a critical challenge for
deep learning models. While recent advancements in large scale vision language
models (VLMs, e.g. GPT4o) might suggest that increasing model and training
dataset size would mitigate this issue, our empirical evaluation shows a more
complicated picture. Testing models using two classic uncertainty
quantification tasks, anomaly detection and classification under inherently
ambiguous conditions, we find that newer and larger VLMs indeed exhibit
improved robustness compared to earlier models, but still suffer from a
tendency to strictly follow instructions, often causing them to hallucinate
confident responses even when faced with unclear or anomalous inputs.
Remarkably, for natural images such as ImageNet, this limitation can be
overcome without pipeline modifications: simply prompting models to abstain
from uncertain predictions enables significant reliability gains, achieving
near-perfect robustness in several settings. However, for domain-specific tasks
such as galaxy morphology classification, a lack of specialized knowledge
prevents reliable uncertainty estimation. Finally, we propose a novel mechanism
based on caption diversity to reveal a model's internal uncertainty, enabling
practitioners to predict when models will successfully abstain without relying
on labeled data.

Abstract: System2 reasoning is developing rapidly these days with the emergence of
Deep- Thinking Models and chain-of-thought technology, which has become a
centralized discussion point in the AI community. However, there is a relative
gap in the research on complex video reasoning at present. In this work, we

which rely heavily on perceptual abilities, it achieved surprising performance
gain with explicit reasoning mechanism. The paradigm consists of three main
components: dynamic inference path routing, problem decoupling strategy, and
video self-consistency verification. In addition, we propose a new standard for
categorization of video questions. CoT- Vid showed outstanding results on a
wide range of benchmarks, and outperforms its base model by 9.3% on Egochema

Conclusion: MedSG-Bench填补了医学图像序列基准测试的空白，MedSeq-Grounder为跨图像细粒度理解提供了工具。

Abstract: Visual grounding is essential for precise perception and reasoning in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially in medical imaging
domains. While existing medical visual grounding benchmarks primarily focus on
single-image scenarios, real-world clinical applications often involve
sequential images, where accurate lesion localization across different
modalities and temporal tracking of disease progression (e.g., pre- vs.
post-treatment comparison) require fine-grained cross-image semantic alignment
and context-aware reasoning. To remedy the underrepresentation of image
sequences in existing medical visual grounding benchmarks, we propose
MedSG-Bench, the first benchmark tailored for Medical Image Sequences
Grounding. It comprises eight VQA-style tasks, formulated into two paradigms of
the grounding tasks, including 1) Image Difference Grounding, which focuses on
detecting change regions across images, and 2) Image Consistency Grounding,
which emphasizes detection of consistent or shared semantics across sequential
images. MedSG-Bench covers 76 public datasets, 10 medical imaging modalities,
and a wide spectrum of anatomical structures and diseases, totaling 9,630
question-answer pairs. We benchmark both general-purpose MLLMs (e.g.,
Qwen2.5-VL) and medical-domain specialized MLLMs (e.g., HuatuoGPT-vision),
observing that even the advanced models exhibit substantial limitations in
medical sequential grounding tasks. To advance this field, we construct
MedSG-188K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset tailored for sequential
visual grounding, and further develop MedSeq-Grounder, an MLLM designed to
facilitate future research on fine-grained understanding across medical
sequential images. The benchmark, dataset, and model are available at

Result: 在多种架构（ResNetV2、Vision Transformers）和数据集（CIFARs、TinyImageNet、ImageNet-1k）上，提高了泛化准确性和训练稳定性，例如ViT-B在ImageNet-1k上提升了4.3%的top-1准确率。

Conclusion: 正交残差更新策略能有效引导模块贡献新的表示方向，提升特征学习和训练效率。

Abstract: Residual connections are pivotal for deep neural networks, enabling greater
depth by mitigating vanishing gradients. However, in standard residual updates,
the module's output is directly added to the input stream. This can lead to
updates that predominantly reinforce or modulate the existing stream direction,
potentially underutilizing the module's capacity for learning entirely novel
features. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal Residual Update: we decompose
the module's output relative to the input stream and add only the component
orthogonal to this stream. This design aims to guide modules to contribute
primarily new representational directions, fostering richer feature learning
while promoting more efficient training. We demonstrate that our orthogonal
update strategy improves generalization accuracy and training stability across
diverse architectures (ResNetV2, Vision Transformers) and datasets (CIFARs,
TinyImageNet, ImageNet-1k), achieving, for instance, a +4.3\%p top-1 accuracy
gain for ViT-B on ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了跨模型迁移的准确性，同时保持了任务向量的模块化和可重用性。

Abstract: Task arithmetic enables efficient model editing by representing task-specific
changes as vectors in parameter space. Task arithmetic typically assumes that
the source and target models are initialized from the same pre-trained
parameters. This assumption limits its applicability in cross-model transfer
settings, where models are independently pre-trained on different datasets. To
address this challenge, we propose a method based on few-shot orthogonal
alignment, which aligns task vectors to the parameter space of a differently
pre-trained target model. These transformations preserve key properties of task
vectors, such as norm and rank, and are learned using only a small number of
labeled examples. We evaluate the method using two Vision Transformers
pre-trained on YFCC100M and LAION400M, and test on eight classification
datasets. Experimental results show that our method improves transfer accuracy
over direct task vector application and achieves performance comparable to
few-shot fine-tuning, while maintaining the modularity and reusability of task
vectors. Our code is available at

Result: 实验表明，LLaVA-4D在4D场景理解任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: LLaVA-4D通过时空提示显著提升了多模态模型对动态场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Despite achieving significant progress in 2D image understanding, large
multimodal models (LMMs) struggle in the physical world due to the lack of
spatial representation. Typically, existing 3D LMMs mainly embed 3D positions
as fixed spatial prompts within visual features to represent the scene.
However, these methods are limited to understanding the static background and
fail to capture temporally varying dynamic objects. In this paper, we propose
LLaVA-4D, a general LMM framework with a novel spatiotemporal prompt for visual
representation in 4D scene understanding. The spatiotemporal prompt is
generated by encoding 3D position and 1D time into a dynamic-aware 4D
coordinate embedding. Moreover, we demonstrate that spatial and temporal
components disentangled from visual features are more effective in
distinguishing the background from objects. This motivates embedding the 4D
spatiotemporal prompt into these features to enhance the dynamic scene
representation. By aligning visual spatiotemporal embeddings with language
embeddings, LMMs gain the ability to understand both spatial and temporal
characteristics of static background and dynamic objects in the physical world.
Additionally, we construct a 4D vision-language dataset with spatiotemporal
coordinate annotations for instruction fine-tuning LMMs. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
different tasks in 4D scene understanding.

Conclusion: Video-GPT通过将视频作为语言建模，展示了在视觉世界建模中的潜力，并具有广泛的下游任务适应性。

Abstract: GPT has shown its remarkable success in natural language processing. However,
the language sequence is not sufficient to describe spatial-temporal details in
the visual world. Alternatively, the video sequence is good at capturing such
details. Motivated by this fact, we propose a concise Video-GPT in this paper
by treating video as new language for visual world modeling. By analogy to next
token prediction in GPT, we introduce a novel next clip diffusion paradigm for
pretraining Video-GPT. Different from the previous works, this distinct
paradigm allows Video-GPT to tackle both short-term generation and long-term
prediction, by autoregressively denoising the noisy clip according to the clean
clips in the history. Extensive experiments show our Video-GPT achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on video prediction, which is the key factor
towards world modeling (Physics-IQ Benchmark: Video-GPT 34.97 vs. Kling 23.64

Result: CURE在2秒内高效移除目标概念，对原始生成能力影响小，且抗攻击性强。

Conclusion: CURE提供了一种无需训练、高效且鲁棒的概念遗忘方法。

Abstract: As Text-to-Image models continue to evolve, so does the risk of generating
unsafe, copyrighted, or privacy-violating content. Existing safety
interventions - ranging from training data curation and model fine-tuning to
inference-time filtering and guidance - often suffer from incomplete concept
removal, susceptibility to jail-breaking, computational inefficiency, or
collateral damage to unrelated capabilities. In this paper, we introduce CURE,
a training-free concept unlearning framework that operates directly in the
weight space of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling fast, interpretable, and
highly specific suppression of undesired concepts. At the core of our method is
the Spectral Eraser, a closed-form, orthogonal projection module that
identifies discriminative subspaces using Singular Value Decomposition over
token embeddings associated with the concepts to forget and retain.
Intuitively, the Spectral Eraser identifies and isolates features unique to the
undesired concept while preserving safe attributes. This operator is then
applied in a single step update to yield an edited model in which the target
concept is effectively unlearned - without retraining, supervision, or
iterative optimization. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and
preserving unrelated concepts, we further introduce an Expansion Mechanism for
spectral regularization which selectively modulates singular vectors based on
their relative significance to control the strength of forgetting. All the
processes above are in closed-form, guaranteeing extremely efficient erasure in
only $2$ seconds. Benchmarking against prior approaches, CURE achieves a more
efficient and thorough removal for targeted artistic styles, objects,
identities, or explicit content, with minor damage to original generation
ability and demonstrates enhanced robustness against red-teaming.

Conclusion: MVAR通过高效建模视觉先验，为视觉生成提供了更轻量级的解决方案。

Abstract: Essential to visual generation is efficient modeling of visual data priors.
Conventional next-token prediction methods define the process as learning the
conditional probability distribution of successive tokens. Recently, next-scale
prediction methods redefine the process to learn the distribution over
multi-scale representations, significantly reducing generation latency.
However, these methods condition each scale on all previous scales and require
each token to consider all preceding tokens, exhibiting scale and spatial
redundancy. To better model the distribution by mitigating redundancy, we
propose Markovian Visual AutoRegressive modeling (MVAR), a novel autoregressive
framework that introduces scale and spatial Markov assumptions to reduce the
complexity of conditional probability modeling. Specifically, we introduce a
scale-Markov trajectory that only takes as input the features of adjacent
preceding scale for next-scale prediction, enabling the adoption of a parallel
training strategy that significantly reduces GPU memory consumption.
Furthermore, we propose spatial-Markov attention, which restricts the attention
of each token to a localized neighborhood of size k at corresponding positions
on adjacent scales, rather than attending to every token across these scales,
for the pursuit of reduced modeling complexity. Building on these improvements,
we reduce the computational complexity of attention calculation from O(N^2) to
O(Nk), enabling training with just eight NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs and eliminating
the need for KV cache during inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
demonstrate that MVAR achieves comparable or superior performance with both
small model trained from scratch and large fine-tuned models, while reducing
the average GPU memory footprint by 3.0x.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods generally fall into two categories. Post-hoc
approaches generate explanations for pre-trained models and are compatible with
various neural network architectures. These methods often use feature
importance visualizations, such as saliency maps, to indicate which input
regions influenced the model's prediction. Unfortunately, they typically offer
a coarse understanding of the model's decision-making process. In contrast,
ante-hoc (inherently explainable) methods rely on specially designed model
architectures trained from scratch. A notable subclass of these methods
provides explanations through prototypes, representative patches extracted from
the training data. However, prototype-based approaches have limitations: they
require dedicated architectures, involve specialized training procedures, and
perform well only on specific datasets. In this work, we propose EPIC
(Explanation of Pretrained Image Classification), a novel approach that bridges
the gap between these two paradigms. Like post-hoc methods, EPIC operates on
pre-trained models without architectural modifications. Simultaneously, it
delivers intuitive, prototype-based explanations inspired by ante-hoc
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, EPIC is the first post-hoc method
capable of fully replicating the core explanatory power of inherently
interpretable models. We evaluate EPIC on benchmark datasets commonly used in
prototype-based explanations, such as CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars, alongside
large-scale datasets like ImageNet, typically employed by post-hoc methods.
EPIC uses prototypes to explain model decisions, providing a flexible and

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), e.g., CLIP, demonstrate impressive
zero-shot capabilities on downstream tasks. Prior research highlights the
crucial role of visual augmentation techniques, like random cropping, in
alignment with fine-grained class descriptions generated by large language
models (LLMs), significantly enhancing zero-shot performance by incorporating
multi-view information. However, the inherent randomness of these augmentations
can inevitably introduce background artifacts and cause models to overly focus

issues, we propose an \textbf{A}ttention-\textbf{B}ased \textbf{S}election
(\textbf{ABS}) method from local details to global context, which applies
attention-guided cropping in both raw images and feature space, supplement
global semantic information through strategic feature selection. Additionally,

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have recently shown strong performance in image
generation, where a critical component is the visual tokenizer (VT) that maps
continuous pixel inputs to discrete token sequences. The quality of the VT
largely defines the upper bound of AR model performance. However, current
discrete VTs fall significantly behind continuous variational autoencoders
(VAEs), leading to degraded image reconstructions and poor preservation of
details and text. Existing benchmarks focus on end-to-end generation quality,
without isolating VT performance. To address this gap, we introduce VTBench, a
comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates VTs across three core
tasks: Image Reconstruction, Detail Preservation, and Text Preservation, and
covers a diverse range of evaluation scenarios. We systematically assess
state-of-the-art VTs using a set of metrics to evaluate the quality of
reconstructed images. Our findings reveal that continuous VAEs produce superior
visual representations compared to discrete VTs, particularly in retaining
spatial structure and semantic detail. In contrast, the degraded
representations produced by discrete VTs often lead to distorted
reconstructions, loss of fine-grained textures, and failures in preserving text
and object integrity. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on GPT-4o image
generation and discuss its potential AR nature, offering new insights into the
role of visual tokenization. We release our benchmark and codebase publicly to

safety preference dataset; 2) targeted alignment of VLMMs using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO); and 3) comprehensive evaluation via our new

safety, with models like LLaVA-NeXT-Video demonstrating substantial

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to segment images into distinct
semantic regions for both seen and unseen categories at the pixel level.
Current methods utilize text embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models
like CLIP but struggle with the inherent domain gap between image and text

relying solely on deep text-aligned features limits shallow-level feature
guidance, which is crucial for detecting small objects and fine details,
ultimately reducing segmentation accuracy. To address these limitations, we
propose a dual prompting framework, DPSeg, for this task. Our approach combines
dual-prompt cost volume generation, a cost volume-guided decoder, and a

Motivation: 现实场景中多模态组合的多样性（如文本与图像的不同组合）对现有模型提出了挑战，因为它们难以在统一嵌入空间中对齐所有模态组合，导致推理性能下降。

Conclusion: UniMoCo通过模态补全和嵌入对齐策略，有效解决了多模态嵌入任务中的挑战，并提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Current research has explored vision-language models for multi-modal
embedding tasks, such as information retrieval, visual grounding, and
classification. However, real-world scenarios often involve diverse modality
combinations between queries and targets, such as text and image to text, text
and image to text and image, and text to text and image. These diverse
combinations pose significant challenges for existing models, as they struggle
to align all modality combinations within a unified embedding space during
training, which degrades performance at inference. To address this limitation,
we propose UniMoCo, a novel vision-language model architecture designed for
multi-modal embedding tasks. UniMoCo introduces a modality-completion module
that generates visual features from textual inputs, ensuring modality
completeness for both queries and targets. Additionally, we develop a
specialized training strategy to align embeddings from both original and
modality-completed inputs, ensuring consistency within the embedding space.
This enables the model to robustly handle a wide range of modality combinations
across embedding tasks. Experiments show that UniMoCo outperforms previous
methods while demonstrating consistent robustness across diverse settings. More
importantly, we identify and quantify the inherent bias in conventional
approaches caused by imbalance of modality combinations in training data, which
can be mitigated through our modality-completion paradigm. The code is

Conclusion: RVTBench和RVTagent为视觉推理任务提供了更全面的基准和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual reasoning, the capability to interpret visual input in response to
implicit text query through multi-step reasoning, remains a challenge for deep
learning models due to the lack of relevant benchmarks. Previous work in visual
reasoning has primarily focused on reasoning segmentation, where models aim to
segment objects based on implicit text queries. This paper introduces reasoning
visual tasks (RVTs), a unified formulation that extends beyond traditional
video reasoning segmentation to a diverse family of visual language reasoning
problems, which can therefore accommodate multiple output formats including
bounding boxes, natural language descriptions, and question-answer pairs.
Correspondingly, we identify the limitations in current benchmark construction
methods that rely solely on large language models (LLMs), which inadequately
capture complex spatial-temporal relationships and multi-step reasoning chains
in video due to their reliance on token representation, resulting in benchmarks
with artificially limited reasoning complexity. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel automated RVT benchmark construction pipeline that leverages
digital twin (DT) representations as structured intermediaries between
perception and the generation of implicit text queries. Based on this method,
we construct RVTBench, a RVT benchmark containing 3,896 queries of over 1.2
million tokens across four types of RVT (segmentation, grounding, VQA and
summary), three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal), and
four increasing difficulty levels, derived from 200 video sequences. Finally,
we propose RVTagent, an agent framework for RVT that allows for zero-shot
generalization across various types of RVT without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了多模态编码器的对抗鲁棒性，且兼容现有基础模型。

Abstract: Recent unified multi-modal encoders align a wide range of modalities into a
shared representation space, enabling diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite their
impressive capabilities, the robustness of these models under adversarial
perturbations remains underexplored, which is a critical concern for
safety-sensitive applications. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
study of adversarial vulnerability in unified multi-modal encoders. We find
that even mild adversarial perturbations lead to substantial performance drops
across all modalities. Non-visual inputs, such as audio and point clouds, are
especially fragile, while visual inputs like images and videos also degrade
significantly. To address this, we propose an efficient adversarial calibration
framework that improves robustness across modalities without modifying
pretrained encoders or semantic centers, ensuring compatibility with existing
foundation models. Our method introduces modality-specific projection heads
trained solely on adversarial examples, while keeping the backbone and
embeddings frozen. We explore three training objectives: fixed-center
cross-entropy, clean-to-adversarial L2 alignment, and clean-adversarial
InfoNCE, and we introduce a regularization strategy to ensure
modality-consistent alignment under attack. Experiments on six modalities and
three Bind-style models show that our method improves adversarial robustness by
up to 47.3 percent at epsilon = 4/255, while preserving or even improving clean
zero-shot and retrieval performance with less than 1 percent trainable

Conclusion: AIGVE-60K数据集和LOVE指标为AI生成视频的评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have driven substantial
progress in both text-to-video (T2V) generation and video-to-text (V2T)
interpretation tasks. However, current AI-generated videos (AIGVs) still
exhibit limitations in terms of perceptual quality and text-video alignment.
Therefore, a reliable and scalable automatic model for AIGV evaluation is
desirable, which heavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations.
To this end, we present AIGVE-60K, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for
AI-Generated Video Evaluation, which features (i) comprehensive tasks,
encompassing 3,050 extensive prompts across 20 fine-grained task dimensions,
(ii) the largest human annotations, including 120K mean-opinion scores (MOSs)

LOVE, a LMM-based metric for AIGV Evaluation from multiple dimensions including
perceptual preference, text-video correspondence, and task-specific accuracy in
terms of both instance level and model level. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that LOVE not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
AIGVE-60K dataset, but also generalizes effectively to a wide range of other
AIGV evaluation benchmarks. These findings highlight the significance of the

fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations from the proposed reasoning

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities in video
understanding; however, their application in video editing remains largely
underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLMs in the
context of video editing. To bridge the gap between visual information and
language-based reasoning, we introduce L-Storyboard, an intermediate
representation that transforms discrete video shots into structured language
descriptions suitable for LLM processing. We categorize video editing tasks
into Convergent Tasks and Divergent Tasks, focusing on three core tasks: Shot
Attributes Classification, Next Shot Selection, and Shot Sequence Ordering. To
address the inherent instability of divergent task outputs, we propose the
StoryFlow strategy, which converts the divergent multi-path reasoning process
into a convergent selection mechanism, effectively enhancing task accuracy and
logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that L-Storyboard
facilitates a more robust mapping between visual information and language
descriptions, significantly improving the interpretability and privacy
protection of video editing tasks. Furthermore, StoryFlow enhances the logical
consistency and output stability in Shot Sequence Ordering, underscoring the
substantial potential of LLMs in intelligent video editing.

Conclusion: Frequency-Pixel Connect是一种高效且通用的领域适应方法，显著提升了跨领域连接性和模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness under domain adaptation settings, where
labeled source data and unlabeled target data come from different
distributions, is a key challenge in real-world applications. A common approach
to improving OOD robustness is through data augmentations. However, in
real-world scenarios, models trained with generic augmentations can only
improve marginally when generalized under distribution shifts toward unlabeled
target domains. While dataset-specific targeted augmentations can address this
issue, they typically require expert knowledge and extensive prior data
analysis to identify the nature of the datasets and domain shift. To address
these challenges, we propose Frequency-Pixel Connect, a domain-adaptation
framework that enhances OOD robustness by introducing a targeted augmentation
in both the frequency space and pixel space. Specifically, we mix the amplitude
spectrum and pixel content of a source image and a target image to generate
augmented samples that introduce domain diversity while preserving the semantic
structure of the source image. Unlike previous targeted augmentation methods
that are both dataset-specific and limited to the pixel space, Frequency-Pixel
Connect is dataset-agnostic, enabling broader and more flexible applicability
beyond natural image datasets. We further analyze the effectiveness of
Frequency-Pixel Connect by evaluating the performance of our method connecting
same-class cross-domain samples while separating different-class examples. We
demonstrate that Frequency-Pixel Connect significantly improves cross-domain
connectivity and outperforms previous generic methods on four diverse
real-world benchmarks across vision, medical, audio, and astronomical domains,
and it also outperforms other dataset-specific targeted augmentation methods.

Conclusion: SSR推动了视觉语言模型向更接近人类的多模态理解发展。

Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) for
multi-modal tasks, their reliance on RGB inputs limits precise spatial
understanding. Existing methods for integrating spatial cues, such as point
clouds or depth, either require specialized sensors or fail to effectively
exploit depth information for higher-order reasoning. To this end, we propose a
novel Spatial Sense and Reasoning method, dubbed SSR, a novel framework that
transforms raw depth data into structured, interpretable textual rationales.
These textual rationales serve as meaningful intermediate representations to
significantly enhance spatial reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we leverage
knowledge distillation to compress the generated rationales into compact latent
embeddings, which facilitate resource-efficient and plug-and-play integration
into existing VLMs without retraining. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we
introduce a new dataset named SSR-CoT, a million-scale visual-language
reasoning dataset enriched with intermediate spatial reasoning annotations, and
present SSRBench, a comprehensive multi-task benchmark. Extensive experiments

intermediate interface between the visual encoder and the large language model.
Building on these insights, we propose a temporal-oriented recipe that

Motivation: TarFlow模型因其因果注意力形式导致采样速度极慢，限制了实际应用。本文旨在通过优化策略解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了Convergence Ranking Metric (CRM)和Initial Guessing Metric (IGM)，用于评估TarFlow块的重要性和初始值质量，并结合GS-Jacobi方法加速采样。

Result: 在四个TarFlow模型上实验表明，GS-Jacobi采样显著提升了效率（最高5.32倍加速），且未降低FID分数或样本质量。

Conclusion: GS-Jacobi方法有效解决了TarFlow采样速度问题，为类似模型的优化提供了参考。

Abstract: Image generation models have achieved widespread applications. As an
instance, the TarFlow model combines the transformer architecture with
Normalizing Flow models, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple
benchmarks. However, due to the causal form of attention requiring sequential
computation, TarFlow's sampling process is extremely slow. In this paper, we
demonstrate that through a series of optimization strategies, TarFlow sampling
can be greatly accelerated by using the Gauss-Seidel-Jacobi (abbreviated as
GS-Jacobi) iteration method. Specifically, we find that blocks in the TarFlow
model have varying importance: a small number of blocks play a major role in
image generation tasks, while other blocks contribute relatively little; some
blocks are sensitive to initial values and prone to numerical overflow, while
others are relatively robust. Based on these two characteristics, we propose
the Convergence Ranking Metric (CRM) and the Initial Guessing Metric (IGM): CRM
is used to identify whether a TarFlow block is "simple" (converges in few
iterations) or "tough" (requires more iterations); IGM is used to evaluate
whether the initial value of the iteration is good. Experiments on four TarFlow
models demonstrate that GS-Jacobi sampling can significantly enhance sampling
efficiency while maintaining the quality of generated images (measured by FID),
achieving speed-ups of 4.53x in Img128cond, 5.32x in AFHQ, 2.96x in
Img64uncond, and 2.51x in Img64cond without degrading FID scores or sample
quality. Code and checkpoints are accessible on

Conclusion: UnInfo是一种有效的TTA方法，能够提升CLIP在传感器退化等分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models such as contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) have demonstrated a remarkable generalizability, which has
enabled a wide range of applications represented by zero-shot classification.
However, vision-language models still suffer when they face datasets with large
gaps from training ones, i.e., distribution shifts. We found that CLIP is
especially vulnerable to sensor degradation, a type of realistic distribution
shift caused by sensor conditions such as weather, light, or noise. Collecting
a new dataset from a test distribution for fine-tuning highly costs since
sensor degradation occurs unexpectedly and has a range of variety. Thus, we
investigate test-time adaptation (TTA) of zero-shot classification, which
enables on-the-fly adaptation to the test distribution with unlabeled test
data. Existing TTA methods for CLIP mainly focus on modifying image and text
embeddings or predictions to address distribution shifts. Although these
methods can adapt to domain shifts, such as fine-grained labels spaces or
different renditions in input images, they fail to adapt to distribution shifts
caused by sensor degradation. We found that this is because image embeddings
are "corrupted" in terms of uniformity, a measure related to the amount of
information. To make models robust to sensor degradation, we propose a novel
method called uniformity-aware information-balanced TTA (UnInfo). To address
the corruption of image embeddings, we introduce uniformity-aware confidence
maximization, information-aware loss balancing, and knowledge distillation from
the exponential moving average (EMA) teacher. Through experiments, we
demonstrate that our UnInfo improves accuracy under sensor degradation by
retaining information in terms of uniformity.

Conclusion: RoPECraft通过RoPE的优化实现了高效且高质量的视频运动迁移。

Abstract: We propose RoPECraft, a training-free video motion transfer method for
diffusion transformers that operates solely by modifying their rotary
positional embeddings (RoPE). We first extract dense optical flow from a
reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the
complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the
generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during
denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target
velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the
text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization
term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform,
projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency
artifacts. Experiments on benchmarks reveal that RoPECraft outperforms all
recently published methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: AdaToken-3D为高效3D多模态学习提供了理论基础，揭示了空间令牌的冗余模式。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have become a pivotal research focus in deep
learning, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in 3D scene understanding.
However, current 3D LMMs employing thousands of spatial tokens for multimodal
reasoning suffer from critical inefficiencies: excessive computational overhead
and redundant information flows. Unlike 2D VLMs processing single images, 3D
LMMs exhibit inherent architectural redundancy due to the heterogeneous
mechanisms between spatial tokens and visual tokens. To address this challenge,
we propose AdaToken-3D, an adaptive spatial token optimization framework that
dynamically prunes redundant tokens through spatial contribution analysis. Our
method automatically tailors pruning strategies to different 3D LMM
architectures by quantifying token-level information flows via attention
pattern mining. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-3D (a 7B parameter 3D-LMM)
demonstrate that AdaToken-3D achieves 21\% faster inference speed and 63\%
FLOPs reduction while maintaining original task accuracy. Beyond efficiency
gains, this work systematically investigates redundancy patterns in multimodal
spatial information flows through quantitative token interaction analysis. Our
findings reveal that over 60\% of spatial tokens contribute minimally ($<$5\%)
to the final predictions, establishing theoretical foundations for efficient 3D
multimodal learning.

Conclusion: BandRC通过数学分析和实验验证，显著提升了隐式神经表示的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, implicit neural representations(INRs) have gained popularity
in the computer vision community. This is mainly due to the strong performance
of INRs in many computer vision tasks. These networks can extract a continuous
signal representation given a discrete signal representation. In previous
studies, it has been repeatedly shown that INR performance has a strong
correlation with the activation functions used in its multilayer perceptrons.
Although numerous activation functions have been proposed that are competitive
with one another, they share some common set of challenges such as spectral
bias(Lack of sensitivity to high-frequency content in signals), limited
robustness to signal noise and difficulties in simultaneous capturing both
local and global features. and furthermore, the requirement for manual
parameter tuning. To address these issues, we introduce a novel activation
function, Band Shifted Raised Cosine Activated Implicit Neural Networks
\textbf{(BandRC)} tailored to enhance signal representation capacity further.
We also incorporate deep prior knowledge extracted from the signal to adjust
the activation functions through a task-specific model. Through a mathematical
analysis and a series of experiments which include image reconstruction (with a
+8.93 dB PSNR improvement over the nearest counterpart), denoising (with a
+0.46 dB increase in PSNR), super-resolution (with a +1.03 dB improvement over
the nearest State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) method for 6X super-resolution),
inpainting, and 3D shape reconstruction we demonstrate the dominance of BandRC
over existing state of the art activation functions.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image generation, using synthetically
generated data seldom brings a significant boost in performance for supervised
learning. Oftentimes, synthetic datasets do not faithfully recreate the data
distribution of real data, i.e., they lack the fidelity or diversity needed for
effective downstream model training. While previous work has employed few-shot
guidance to address this issue, existing methods still fail to capture and
generate features unique to specific real images. In this paper, we introduce a
novel dataset generation framework named LoFT, LoRA-Fused Training-data
Generation with Few-shot Guidance. Our method fine-tunes LoRA weights on
individual real images and fuses them at inference time, producing synthetic
images that combine the features of real images for improved diversity and
fidelity of generated data. We evaluate the synthetic data produced by LoFT on
10 datasets, using 8 to 64 real images per class as guidance and scaling up to
1000 images per class. Our experiments show that training on LoFT-generated
data consistently outperforms other synthetic dataset methods, significantly
increasing accuracy as the dataset size increases. Additionally, our analysis
demonstrates that LoFT generates datasets with high fidelity and sufficient
diversity, which contribute to the performance improvement. The code is

EgoDex: the largest and most diverse dataset of dexterous human manipulation to

tracking data collected at the time of recording, where multiple calibrated
cameras and on-device SLAM can be used to precisely track the pose of every
joint of each hand. The dataset covers a wide range of diverse manipulation
behaviors with everyday household objects in 194 different tabletop tasks
ranging from tying shoelaces to folding laundry. Furthermore, we train and

Abstract: Recent advances in data-centric deep generative models have led to
significant progress in solving inverse imaging problems. However, these models
(e.g., diffusion models (DMs)) typically require large amounts of fully sampled
(clean) training data, which is often impractical in medical and scientific
settings such as dynamic imaging.
  On the other hand, training-data-free approaches like the Deep Image Prior
(DIP) do not require clean ground-truth images but suffer from noise
overfitting and can be computationally expensive as the network parameters need
to be optimized for each measurement set independently. Moreover, DIP-based
methods often overlook the potential of learning a prior using a small number
of sub-sampled measurements (or degraded images) available during training. In
this paper, we propose UGoDIT, an Unsupervised Group DIP via Transferable
weights, designed for the low-data regime where only a very small number, M, of
sub-sampled measurement vectors are available during training. Our method
learns a set of transferable weights by optimizing a shared encoder and M
disentangled decoders. At test time, we reconstruct the unseen degraded image
using a DIP network, where part of the parameters are fixed to the learned
weights, while the remaining are optimized to enforce measurement consistency.
We evaluate UGoDIT on both medical (multi-coil MRI) and natural (super
resolution and non-linear deblurring) image recovery tasks under various
settings. Compared to recent standalone DIP methods, UGoDIT provides
accelerated convergence and notable improvement in reconstruction quality.
Furthermore, our method achieves performance competitive with SOTA DM-based and
supervised approaches, despite not requiring large amounts of clean training
data.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have significantly advanced image editing,
enabling highly realistic and local modifications based on textual prompts.
While these developments expand creative possibilities, their malicious use
poses substantial challenges for detection of such subtle deepfake edits. To
this end, we introduce Explain Edit (X-Edit), a novel method for localizing
diffusion-based edits in images. To localize the edits for an image, we invert
the image using a pretrained diffusion model, then use these inverted features
as input to a segmentation network that explicitly predicts the edited masked
regions via channel and spatial attention. Further, we finetune the model using
a combined segmentation and relevance loss. The segmentation loss ensures
accurate mask prediction by balancing pixel-wise errors and perceptual
similarity, while the relevance loss guides the model to focus on low-frequency
regions and mitigate high-frequency artifacts, enhancing the localization of
subtle edits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address and
model the problem of localizing diffusion-based modified regions in images. We
additionally contribute a new dataset of paired original and edited images
addressing the current lack of resources for this task. Experimental results
demonstrate that X-Edit accurately localizes edits in images altered by
text-guided diffusion models, outperforming baselines in PSNR and SSIM metrics.
This highlights X-Edit's potential as a robust forensic tool for detecting and
pinpointing manipulations introduced by advanced image editing techniques.

prediction. Evaluated across 15 benchmarks, it consistently surpasses existing
prompt- and adapter-based methods in all shot settings while remaining highly

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various visual
generation tasks, including image, video, and 3D content generation. Preference
optimization (PO) is a prominent and growing area of research that aims to
align these models with human preferences. While existing PO methods primarily
concentrate on producing favorable outputs, they often overlook the
significance of classifier-free guidance (CFG) in mitigating undesirable
results. Diffusion-NPO addresses this gap by introducing negative preference
optimization (NPO), training models to generate outputs opposite to human
preferences and thereby steering them away from unfavorable outcomes. However,
prior NPO approaches, including Diffusion-NPO, rely on costly and fragile
procedures for obtaining explicit preference annotations (e.g., manual pairwise
labeling or reward model training), limiting their practicality in domains
where such data are scarce or difficult to acquire. In this work, we introduce
Self-NPO, a Negative Preference Optimization approach that learns exclusively
from the model itself, thereby eliminating the need for manual data labeling or
reward model training. Moreover, our method is highly efficient and does not
require exhaustive data sampling. We demonstrate that Self-NPO integrates
seamlessly into widely used diffusion models, including SD1.5, SDXL, and
CogVideoX, as well as models already optimized for human preferences,

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) has attracted remarkable attention in hyperspectral
image (HSI) processing fields, and most existing deep learning (DL)-based
algorithms indicate dramatic potential for detecting anomaly samples through
specific training process under current scenario. However, the limited prior
information and the catastrophic forgetting problem indicate crucial challenges
for existing DL structure in open scenarios cross-domain detection. In order to
improve the detection performance, a novel continual learning-based capsule
differential generative adversarial network (CL-CaGAN) is proposed to elevate
the cross-scenario learning performance for facilitating the real application
of DL-based structure in hyperspectral AD (HAD) task. First, a modified capsule
structure with adversarial learning network is constructed to estimate the
background distribution for surmounting the deficiency of prior information. To
mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, clustering-based sample replay
strategy and a designed extra self-distillation regularization are integrated
for merging the history and future knowledge in continual AD task, while the
discriminative learning ability from previous detection scenario to current
scenario is retained by the elaborately designed structure with continual
learning (CL) strategy. In addition, the differentiable enhancement is enforced
to augment the generation performance of the training data. This further
stabilizes the training process with better convergence and efficiently
consolidates the reconstruction ability of background samples. To verify the
effectiveness of our proposed CL-CaGAN, we conduct experiments on several real
HSIs, and the results indicate that the proposed CL-CaGAN demonstrates higher
detection performance and continuous learning capacity for mitigating the
catastrophic forgetting under cross-domain scenarios.

parameters releasing and enhancing between new task and history tasks from a
Bayesian perspective. Meanwhile, BioGAN loss with L2-Norm enhances
self-attention (SA) to further balance the stability and flexibility for better
fitting background distribution for open scenario HAD (OHAD) tasks. Experiment

Abstract: Visibility analysis is one of the fundamental analytics methods in urban
planning and landscape research, traditionally conducted through computational
simulations based on the Line-of-Sight (LoS) principle. However, when assessing
the visibility of named urban objects such as landmarks, geometric intersection
alone fails to capture the contextual and perceptual dimensions of visibility
as experienced in the real world. The study challenges the traditional
LoS-based approaches by introducing a new, image-based visibility analysis
method. Specifically, a Vision Language Model (VLM) is applied to detect the
target object within a direction-zoomed Street View Image (SVI). Successful
detection represents the object's visibility at the corresponding SVI location.
Further, a heterogeneous visibility graph is constructed to address the complex
interaction between observers and target objects. In the first case study, the
method proves its reliability in detecting the visibility of six tall landmark
constructions in global cities, with an overall accuracy of 87%. Furthermore,
it reveals broader contextual differences when the landmarks are perceived and
experienced. In the second case, the proposed visibility graph uncovers the
form and strength of connections for multiple landmarks along the River Thames
in London, as well as the places where these connections occur. Notably,
bridges on the River Thames account for approximately 30% of total connections.
Our method complements and enhances traditional LoS-based visibility analysis,
and showcases the possibility of revealing the prevalent connection of any
visual objects in the urban environment. It opens up new research perspectives
for urban planning, heritage conservation, and computational social science.

Abstract: Data augmentation for domain-specific image classification tasks often
struggles to simultaneously address diversity, faithfulness, and label clarity
of generated data, leading to suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. While
existing generative diffusion model-based methods aim to enhance augmentation,
they fail to cohesively tackle these three critical aspects and often overlook
intrinsic challenges of diffusion models, such as sensitivity to model
characteristics and stochasticity under strong transformations. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework that explicitly integrates diversity,
faithfulness, and label clarity into the augmentation process. Our approach
employs saliency-guided mixing and a fine-tuned diffusion model to preserve
foreground semantics, enrich background diversity, and ensure label
consistency, while mitigating diffusion model limitations. Extensive
experiments across fine-grained, long-tail, few-shot, and background robustness
tasks demonstrate our method's superior performance over state-of-the-art

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用部分数据（如低分辨率图像、带水印视频等）训练扩散模型的方法，通过分别训练每个数据视图的扩散模型和预测残差评分函数，证明了该方法在适当正则化下能降低泛化误差。

Motivation: 获取大规模高质量数据训练扩散模型具有挑战性，而部分数据（如低分辨率图像、带水印视频）通常被视为损坏数据。本研究探讨了利用这些部分数据训练扩散模型的理论可行性。

Method: 提出一种利用部分数据视图训练扩散模型的方法：1）为每个数据视图单独训练扩散模型；2）训练预测残差评分函数的模型。通过理论分析证明了方法的有效性。

Result: 证明了该方法在适当正则化下能降低泛化误差，且残差评分函数训练的难度与部分数据视图未捕获的信号相关性成正比。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了接近一阶最优的数据效率，为利用部分数据训练扩散模型提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Training diffusion models requires large datasets. However, acquiring large
volumes of high-quality data can be challenging, for example, collecting large
numbers of high-resolution images and long videos. On the other hand, there are
many complementary data that are usually considered corrupted or partial, such
as low-resolution images and short videos. Other examples of corrupted data
include videos that contain subtitles, watermarks, and logos. In this study, we
investigate the theoretical problem of whether the above partial data can be
utilized to train conventional diffusion models. Motivated by our theoretical
analysis in this study, we propose a straightforward approach of training
diffusion models utilizing partial data views, where we consider each form of
complementary data as a view of conventional data. Our proposed approach first
trains one separate diffusion model for each individual view, and then trains a
model for predicting the residual score function. We prove generalization error
bounds, which show that the proposed diffusion model training approach can
achieve lower generalization errors if proper regularizations are adopted in
the residual score function training. In particular, we prove that the
difficulty in training the residual score function scales proportionally with
the signal correlations not captured by partial data views. Consequently, the
proposed approach achieves near first-order optimal data efficiency.

Abstract: Accurately analyzing the motion parts and their motion attributes in dynamic
environments is crucial for advancing key areas such as embodied intelligence.
Addressing the limitations of existing methods that rely on dense multi-view
images or detailed part-level annotations, we propose an innovative framework
that can analyze 3D mobility from monocular videos in a zero-shot manner. This
framework can precisely parse motion parts and motion attributes only using a
monocular video, completely eliminating the need for annotated training data.
Specifically, our method first constructs the scene geometry and roughly
analyzes the motion parts and their initial motion attributes combining depth
estimation, optical flow analysis and point cloud registration method, then
employs 2D Gaussian splatting for scene representation. Building on this, we
introduce an end-to-end dynamic scene optimization algorithm specifically
designed for articulated objects, refining the initial analysis results to
ensure the system can handle 'rotation', 'translation', and even complex
movements ('rotation+translation'), demonstrating high flexibility and
versatility. To validate the robustness and wide applicability of our method,
we created a comprehensive dataset comprising both simulated and real-world
scenarios. Experimental results show that our framework can effectively analyze
articulated object motions in an annotation-free manner, showcasing its
significant potential in future embodied intelligence applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in prompt-based medical image segmentation have enabled
clinicians to identify tumors using simple input like bounding boxes or text
prompts. However, existing methods face challenges when doctors need to
interact through natural language or when position reasoning is required -
understanding spatial relationships between anatomical structures and
pathologies. We present PRS-Med, a framework that integrates vision-language
models with segmentation capabilities to generate both accurate segmentation
masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. Additionally, we introduce
the MMRS dataset (Multimodal Medical in Positional Reasoning Segmentation),
which provides diverse, spatially-grounded question-answer pairs to address the
lack of position reasoning data in medical imaging. PRS-Med demonstrates
superior performance across six imaging modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, ultrasound,
endoscopy, RGB), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both
segmentation accuracy and position reasoning. Our approach enables intuitive
doctor-system interaction through natural language, facilitating more efficient
diagnoses. Our dataset pipeline, model, and codebase will be released to foster

Abstract: Remarkable progress in zero-shot learning (ZSL) has been achieved using
generative models. However, existing generative ZSL methods merely generate
(imagine) the visual features from scratch guided by the strong class semantic
vectors annotated by experts, resulting in suboptimal generative performance
and limited scene generalization. To address these and advance ZSL, we propose
an inductive variational autoencoder for generative zero-shot learning, dubbed
GenZSL. Mimicking human-level concept learning, GenZSL operates by inducting
new class samples from similar seen classes using weak class semantic vectors
derived from target class names (i.e., CLIP text embedding). To ensure the
generation of informative samples for training an effective ZSL classifier, our
GenZSL incorporates two key strategies. Firstly, it employs class diversity
promotion to enhance the diversity of class semantic vectors. Secondly, it
utilizes target class-guided information boosting criteria to optimize the
model. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark datasets
showcase the superiority and potential of our GenZSL with significant efficacy
and efficiency over f-VAEGAN, e.g., 24.7% performance gains and more than
$60\times$ faster training speed on AWA2. Codes are available at

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法在细粒度视觉任务中表现不佳，因为它们将所有输出信息视为同等重要，导致学生模型无法捕捉教师的细微决策边界。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、TinyImageNet等多个细粒度数据集上，FiGKD优于现有基于logit和特征的知识蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 频率感知的logit分解能更高效地传递知识，特别适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted technique for transferring
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to a smaller student model by
aligning their output distributions. However, existing methods often
underperform in fine-grained visual recognition tasks, where distinguishing
subtle differences between visually similar classes is essential. This
performance gap stems from the fact that conventional approaches treat the
teacher's output logits as a single, undifferentiated signal-assuming all
contained information is equally beneficial to the student. Consequently,
student models may become overloaded with redundant signals and fail to capture
the teacher's nuanced decision boundaries. To address this issue, we propose
Fine-Grained Knowledge Distillation (FiGKD), a novel frequency-aware framework
that decomposes a model's logits into low-frequency (content) and
high-frequency (detail) components using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT).
FiGKD selectively transfers only the high-frequency components, which encode
the teacher's semantic decision patterns, while discarding redundant
low-frequency content already conveyed through ground-truth supervision. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and requires no access to
intermediate feature maps. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet,
and multiple fine-grained recognition benchmarks show that FiGKD consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art logit-based and feature-based distillation methods
across a variety of teacher-student configurations. These findings confirm that
frequency-aware logit decomposition enables more efficient and effective
knowledge transfer, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: The 180x360 omnidirectional field of view captured by 360-degree cameras
enables their use in a wide range of applications such as embodied AI and
virtual reality. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have shown promise in visual-spatial reasoning, most studies focus on
standard pinhole-view images, leaving omnidirectional perception largely
unexplored. In this paper, we ask: Are MLLMs ready for omnidirectional spatial
reasoning? To investigate this, we introduce OSR-Bench, the first benchmark
specifically designed for this setting. OSR-Bench includes over 153,000 diverse
question-answer pairs grounded in high-fidelity panoramic indoor scene maps. It
covers key reasoning types including object counting, relative distance, and
direction. We also propose a negative sampling strategy that inserts
non-existent objects into prompts to evaluate hallucination and grounding
robustness. For fine-grained analysis, we design a two-stage evaluation
framework assessing both cognitive map generation and QA accuracy using
rotation-invariant matching and a combination of rule-based and LLM-based
metrics. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5
Pro, and leading open-source models under zero-shot settings. Results show that
current models struggle with spatial reasoning in panoramic contexts,
highlighting the need for more perceptually grounded MLLMs. OSR-Bench and code

Conclusion: DC-Seg通过解耦表示和正则化设计，有效解决了多模态脑图像分割中的模态缺失问题。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain images typically requires the integration of
complementary information from multiple image modalities. However, clinical
data for all modalities may not be available for every patient, creating a
significant challenge. To address this, previous studies encode multiple
modalities into a shared latent space. While somewhat effective, it remains
suboptimal, as each modality contains distinct and valuable information. In
this study, we propose DC-Seg (Disentangled Contrastive Learning for
Segmentation), a new method that explicitly disentangles images into
modality-invariant anatomical representation and modality-specific
representation, by using anatomical contrastive learning and modality
contrastive learning respectively. This solution improves the separation of
anatomical and modality-specific features by considering the modality gaps,
leading to more robust representations. Furthermore, we introduce a
segmentation-based regularizer that enhances the model's robustness to missing
modalities. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2020 and a private white matter
hyperintensity(WMH) segmentation dataset demonstrate that DC-Seg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in handling incomplete multimodal brain tumor
segmentation tasks with varying missing modalities, while also demonstrate
strong generalizability in WMH segmentation. The code is available at

Conclusion: AoP-SAM使SAM更适合自动化分割任务，同时保持了其零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a powerful foundation model for image
segmentation, showing robust zero-shot generalization through prompt
engineering. However, relying on manual prompts is impractical for real-world
applications, particularly in scenarios where rapid prompt provision and
resource efficiency are crucial. In this paper, we propose the Automation of
Prompts for SAM (AoP-SAM), a novel approach that learns to generate essential
prompts in optimal locations automatically. AoP-SAM enhances SAM's efficiency
and usability by eliminating manual input, making it better suited for
real-world tasks. Our approach employs a lightweight yet efficient Prompt
Predictor model that detects key entities across images and identifies the
optimal regions for placing prompt candidates. This method leverages SAM's
image embeddings, preserving its zero-shot generalization capabilities without
requiring fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduce a test-time instance-level
Adaptive Sampling and Filtering mechanism that generates prompts in a
coarse-to-fine manner. This notably enhances both prompt and mask generation
efficiency by reducing computational overhead and minimizing redundant mask
refinements. Evaluations of three datasets demonstrate that AoP-SAM
substantially improves both prompt generation efficiency and mask generation
accuracy, making SAM more effective for automated segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is an important research topic for
relieving radiologist' heavy workload. Existing RRG models mainly rely on
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) based on different model architectures using data
pairs of radiological images and corresponding radiologist-annotated reports.
Recent research has shifted focus to post-training improvements, aligning RRG
model outputs with human preferences using reinforcement learning (RL).
However, the limited data coverage of high-quality annotated data poses risks
of overfitting and generalization. This paper proposes a novel Online Iterative
Self-Alignment (OISA) method for RRG that consists of four stages:
self-generation of diverse data, self-evaluation for multi-objective preference
data,self-alignment for multi-objective optimization and self-iteration for
further improvement. Our approach allows for generating varied reports tailored
to specific clinical objectives, enhancing the overall performance of the RRG
model iteratively. Unlike existing methods, our frame-work significantly
increases data quality and optimizes performance through iterative
multi-objective optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
surpasses previous approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance across
multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Although large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in a wide range of multimodal tasks, their true reasoning
capabilities on human IQ tests remain underexplored. To advance research on the
fluid intelligence of VLMs, we introduce **IQBench**, a new benchmark designed
to evaluate VLMs on standardized visual IQ tests. We focus on evaluating the
reasoning capabilities of VLMs, which we argue are more important than the
accuracy of the final prediction. **Our benchmark is visually centric,
minimizing the dependence on unnecessary textual content**, thus encouraging
models to derive answers primarily from image-based information rather than
learned textual knowledge. To this end, we manually collected and annotated 500
visual IQ questions to **prevent unintentional data leakage during training**.
Unlike prior work that focuses primarily on the accuracy of the final answer,
we evaluate the reasoning ability of the models by assessing their explanations
and the patterns used to solve each problem, along with the accuracy of the
final prediction and human evaluation. Our experiments show that there are
substantial performance disparities between tasks, with models such as
`o4-mini`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, and `claude-3.7-sonnet` achieving the highest
average accuracies of 0.615, 0.578, and 0.548, respectively. However, all
models struggle with 3D spatial and anagram reasoning tasks, highlighting
significant limitations in current VLMs' general reasoning abilities. In terms
of reasoning scores, `o4-mini`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, and `claude-3.7-sonnet`
achieved top averages of 0.696, 0.586, and 0.516, respectively. These results
highlight inconsistencies between the reasoning processes of the models and
their final answers, emphasizing the importance of evaluating the accuracy of
the reasoning in addition to the final predictions.

Collaborative and Expansion Mixture-of-Experts (HCE-MoE). MCO-Mamba, building
upon Mamba, leverages dual-modal information to jointly optimize the model,
facilitating collaborative interaction and fusion of modal semantics. This
approach encourages the model to balance the learning of both modalities and
harness their respective strengths. HCE-MoE, on the other hand, employs a
dynamic routing mechanism to distribute structurally varied experts (deep,

feature extraction paradigms to comprehensively capture expression semantics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed network achieves

Fluorescent triggers are invisible under normal conditions and activated

fluorescence simulation algorithm. Furthermore, we develop an automated

Conclusion: TSS为扩散SR提供了一种高效加速方法，同时保持性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have gained attention for their success in modeling complex
distributions, achieving impressive perceptual quality in SR tasks. However,
existing diffusion-based SR methods often suffer from high computational costs,
requiring numerous iterative steps for training and inference. Existing
acceleration techniques, such as distillation and solver optimization, are
generally task-agnostic and do not fully leverage the specific characteristics
of low-level tasks like super-resolution (SR). In this study, we analyze the
frequency- and spatial-domain properties of diffusion-based SR methods,
revealing key insights into the temporal and spatial dependencies of
high-frequency signal recovery. Specifically, high-frequency details benefit
from concentrated optimization during early and late diffusion iterations,
while spatially textured regions demand adaptive denoising strategies. Building
on these observations, we propose the Time-Spatial-aware Sampling strategy
(TSS) for the acceleration of Diffusion SR without any extra training cost. TSS
combines Time Dynamic Sampling (TDS), which allocates more iterations to
refining textures, and Spatial Dynamic Sampling (SDS), which dynamically
adjusts strategies based on image content. Extensive evaluations across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TSS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance with significantly fewer iterations, improving MUSIQ scores by 0.2

Conclusion: Duration-Proportional Information Assumption和Partial RoPE显著提升了视频生成的效率和能力。

Abstract: Modern video generation frameworks based on Latent Diffusion Models suffer
from inefficiencies in tokenization due to the Frame-Proportional Information
Assumption. Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates,
causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with
the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information
Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is
proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this
insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that
enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate
training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes
Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content
modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE
effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation
capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal
representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and
state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to

Result: 在公共病理数据集上，所提算法在袋级和实例级预测上均表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过伪标签校正，MIL的性能得到显著提升，为数字病理学中的分类任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning is the predominant method for Whole Slide Image
classification in digital pathology, enabling the use of slide-level labels to
supervise model training. Although MIL eliminates the tedious fine-grained
annotation process for supervised learning, whether it can learn accurate bag-
and instance-level classifiers remains a question. To address the issue,
instance-level classifiers and instance masks were incorporated to ground the
prediction on supporting patches. These methods, while practically improving
the performance of MIL methods, may potentially introduce noisy labels. We
propose to bridge the gap between commonly used MIL and fully supervised
learning by augmenting both the bag- and instance-level learning processes with
pseudo-label correction capabilities elicited from weak to strong
generalization techniques. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of
dual-level MIL algorithms on both bag- and instance-level predictions.
Experiments on public pathology datasets showcase the advantage of the proposed
methods.

Conclusion: EarthSynth为RSI解释任务提供了实用的解决方案，并首次探索了多任务生成在遥感领域的应用。

Abstract: Remote sensing image (RSI) interpretation typically faces challenges due to
the scarcity of labeled data, which limits the performance of RSI
interpretation tasks. To tackle this challenge, we propose EarthSynth, a
diffusion-based generative foundation model that enables synthesizing
multi-category, cross-satellite labeled Earth observation for downstream RSI

explore multi-task generation for remote sensing. EarthSynth, trained on the
EarthSynth-180K dataset, employs the Counterfactual Composition training
strategy to improve training data diversity and enhance category control.
Furthermore, a rule-based method of R-Filter is proposed to filter more
informative synthetic data for downstream tasks. We evaluate our EarthSynth on
scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation in open-world

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割评估指标（如PQ）依赖硬阈值匹配，忽略了错误之间的重要区别，且无法逐步奖励模型改进。SoftPQ旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SoftPQ通过定义部分匹配区域和应用子线性惩罚函数，将评估设计为一个连续评分系统，而非二元分类。

Result: 实验表明，SoftPQ能捕捉现有指标忽略的分割质量差异，提供更平滑的评分行为和更有意义的反馈。

Conclusion: SoftPQ是一种灵活且可解释的实例分割评估指标，适用于基准测试和模型迭代改进。

Abstract: Segmentation evaluation metrics traditionally rely on binary decision logic:
predictions are either correct or incorrect, based on rigid IoU thresholds.
Detection--based metrics such as F1 and mAP determine correctness at the object
level using fixed overlap cutoffs, while overlap--based metrics like
Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice operate at the pixel level, often
overlooking instance--level structure. Panoptic Quality (PQ) attempts to unify
detection and segmentation assessment, but it remains dependent on
hard-threshold matching--treating predictions below the threshold as entirely
incorrect. This binary framing obscures important distinctions between
qualitatively different errors and fails to reward gradual model improvements.
We propose SoftPQ, a flexible and interpretable instance segmentation metric
that redefines evaluation as a graded continuum rather than a binary
classification. SoftPQ introduces tunable upper and lower IoU thresholds to
define a partial matching region and applies a sublinear penalty function to
ambiguous or fragmented predictions. These extensions allow SoftPQ to exhibit
smoother score behavior, greater robustness to structural segmentation errors,
and more informative feedback for model development and evaluation. Through
controlled perturbation experiments, we show that SoftPQ captures meaningful
differences in segmentation quality that existing metrics overlook, making it a
practical and principled alternative for both benchmarking and iterative model
refinement.

Result: 在极端高斯噪声下，线性探测准确率比DINOv2提高4.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了通过噪声感知预训练实现去噪器无关的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has become a powerful solution to extract rich
representations from unlabeled data. Yet, SSL research is mostly focused on
clean, curated and high-quality datasets. As a result, applying SSL on noisy
data remains a challenge, despite being crucial to applications such as
astrophysics, medical imaging, geophysics or finance. In this work, we present
a fully self-supervised framework that enables noise-robust representation
learning without requiring a denoiser at inference or downstream fine-tuning.
Our method first trains an SSL denoiser on noisy data, then uses it to
construct a denoised-to-noisy data curriculum (i.e., training first on
denoised, then noisy samples) for pretraining a SSL backbone (e.g., DINOv2),
combined with a teacher-guided regularization that anchors noisy embeddings to
their denoised counterparts. This process encourages the model to internalize
noise robustness. Notably, the denoiser can be discarded after pretraining,
simplifying deployment. On ImageNet-1k with ViT-B under extreme Gaussian noise
($\sigma=255$, SNR = 0.72 dB), our method improves linear probing accuracy by
4.8% over DINOv2, demonstrating that denoiser-free robustness can emerge from
noise-aware pretraining. The code is available at

high-quality evaluation set by integrating eight public datasets and one
private farmland plot dataset, containing 25,026 QA pairs and 15,556 images.
The pipeline begins with multi-source data preprocessing, including collection,
format standardization, and annotation refinement. We then generate a diverse

tasks. Finally, we employ LMMs for inference, generating responses, and
performing detailed examinations. We evaluated 18 open-source LMMs and 3

Result: 在多个任务和基准测试中表现优于现有方法，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: PMQ-VE为视频增强任务提供了一种高效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-frame video enhancement tasks aim to improve the spatial and temporal
resolution and quality of video sequences by leveraging temporal information
from multiple frames, which are widely used in streaming video processing,
surveillance, and generation. Although numerous Transformer-based enhancement
methods have achieved impressive performance, their computational and memory
demands hinder deployment on edge devices. Quantization offers a practical
solution by reducing the bit-width of weights and activations to improve
efficiency. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to video
enhancement tasks often leads to significant performance degradation and loss
of fine details. This stems from two limitations: (a) inability to allocate
varying representational capacity across frames, which results in suboptimal
dynamic range adaptation; (b) over-reliance on full-precision teachers, which
limits the learning of low-bit student models. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a novel quantization method for video enhancement: Progressive
Multi-Frame Quantization for Video Enhancement (PMQ-VE). This framework
features a coarse-to-fine two-stage process: Backtracking-based Multi-Frame
Quantization (BMFQ) and Progressive Multi-Teacher Distillation (PMTD). BMFQ
utilizes a percentile-based initialization and iterative search with pruning
and backtracking for robust clipping bounds. PMTD employs a progressive
distillation strategy with both full-precision and multiple high-bit (INT)
teachers to enhance low-bit models' capacity and quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving
state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks and benchmarks.The code will

Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence, new forgery
methods are rapidly emerging. Social platforms are flooded with vast amounts of
unlabeled synthetic data and authentic data, making it increasingly challenging
to distinguish real from fake. Due to the lack of labels, existing supervised
detection methods struggle to effectively address the detection of unknown
deepfake methods. Moreover, in open world scenarios, the amount of unlabeled
data greatly exceeds that of labeled data. Therefore, we define a new deepfake
detection generalization task which focuses on how to achieve efficient
detection of large amounts of unlabeled data based on limited labeled data to
simulate a open world scenario. To solve the above mentioned task, we propose a
novel Open-World Deepfake Detection Generalization Enhancement Training
Strategy (OWG-DS) to improve the generalization ability of existing methods.
Our approach aims to transfer deepfake detection knowledge from a small amount
of labeled source domain data to large-scale unlabeled target domain data.
Specifically, we introduce the Domain Distance Optimization (DDO) module to
align different domain features by optimizing both inter-domain and
intra-domain distances. Additionally, the Similarity-based Class Boundary
Separation (SCBS) module is used to enhance the aggregation of similar samples
to ensure clearer class boundaries, while an adversarial training mechanism is
adopted to learn the domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments show that
the proposed deepfake detection generalization enhancement training strategy

processes CLIP features alongside super-resolution features through a

Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity into visual representations is a
fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial
intelligence. While EEG-based visual decoding has shown promise due to its
non-invasive, low-cost nature and millisecond-level temporal resolution,
existing methods are limited by their reliance on flat neural representations
that overlook the brain's inherent visual hierarchy. In this paper, we
introduce ViEEG, a biologically inspired hierarchical EEG decoding framework
that aligns with the Hubel-Wiesel theory of visual processing. ViEEG decomposes
each visual stimulus into three biologically aligned components-contour,
foreground object, and contextual scene-serving as anchors for a three-stream
EEG encoder. These EEG features are progressively integrated via
cross-attention routing, simulating cortical information flow from V1 to IT to
the association cortex. We further adopt hierarchical contrastive learning to
align EEG representations with CLIP embeddings, enabling zero-shot object
recognition. Extensive experiments on the THINGS-EEG dataset demonstrate that
ViEEG achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 40.9% Top-1 accuracy in
subject-dependent and 22.9% Top-1 accuracy in cross-subject settings,

Abstract: Drag-based editing within pretrained diffusion model provides a precise and
flexible way to manipulate foreground objects. Traditional methods optimize the
input feature obtained from DDIM inversion directly, adjusting them iteratively
to guide handle points towards target locations. However, these approaches
often suffer from limited accuracy due to the low representation ability of the
feature in motion supervision, as well as inefficiencies caused by the large
search space required for point tracking. To address these limitations, we
present DragLoRA, a novel framework that integrates LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
adapters into the drag-based editing pipeline. To enhance the training of LoRA
adapters, we introduce an additional denoising score distillation loss which
regularizes the online model by aligning its output with that of the original
model. Additionally, we improve the consistency of motion supervision by
adapting the input features using the updated LoRA, giving a more stable and
accurate input feature for subsequent operations. Building on this, we design
an adaptive optimization scheme that dynamically toggles between two modes,
prioritizing efficiency without compromising precision. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DragLoRA significantly enhances the control precision and
computational efficiency for drag-based image editing. The Codes of DragLoRA

Motivation: 现有方法（如分割图和深度图）在控制扩散模型输出时引入了空间刚性，限制了模型的多样性。DGM旨在通过学习几何先验，提供更灵活的控制机制。

Result: 实验表明，DGM能有效平衡扩散模型生成图像的多样性和可控性。

Conclusion: DGM为扩散模型提供了一种灵活的控制机制，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable capabilities in
synthesizing images, but often struggle to provide fine-grained control over
the output. Existing guidance approaches, such as segmentation maps and depth
maps, introduce spatial rigidity that restricts the inherent diversity of
diffusion models. In this work, we introduce Deep Geometric Moments (DGM) as a
novel form of guidance that encapsulates the subject's visual features and
nuances through a learned geometric prior. DGMs focus specifically on the
subject itself compared to DINO or CLIP features, which suffer from
overemphasis on global image features or semantics. Unlike ResNets, which are
sensitive to pixel-wise perturbations, DGMs rely on robust geometric moments.
Our experiments demonstrate that DGM effectively balance control and diversity
in diffusion-based image generation, allowing a flexible control mechanism for
steering the diffusion process.

Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索方法忽视模态间隙和批量采样中的假阴性问题，导致InfoNCE损失下的梯度冲突。

Result: 在四个检索基准测试中，GARE显著提升对齐准确性和对噪声监督的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GARE通过间隙感知的张力缓解机制，有效解决了文本-视频检索中的梯度冲突问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-video retrieval have been largely driven by
contrastive learning frameworks. However, existing methods overlook a key
source of optimization tension: the separation between text and video
distributions in the representation space (referred to as the modality gap),
and the prevalence of false negatives in batch sampling. These factors lead to
conflicting gradients under the InfoNCE loss, impeding stable alignment. To
mitigate this, we propose GARE, a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that introduces
a learnable, pair-specific increment Delta_ij between text t_i and video v_j to
offload the tension from the global anchor representation. We first derive the
ideal form of Delta_ij via a coupled multivariate first-order Taylor
approximation of the InfoNCE loss under a trust-region constraint, revealing it
as a mechanism for resolving gradient conflicts by guiding updates along a
locally optimal descent direction. Due to the high cost of directly computing
Delta_ij, we introduce a lightweight neural module conditioned on the semantic
gap between each video-text pair, enabling structure-aware correction guided by
gradient supervision. To further stabilize learning and promote
interpretability, we regularize Delta using three components: a trust-region
constraint to prevent oscillation, a directional diversity term to promote
semantic coverage, and an information bottleneck to limit redundancy.
Experiments across four retrieval benchmarks show that GARE consistently
improves alignment accuracy and robustness to noisy supervision, confirming the
effectiveness of gap-aware tension mitigation.

Conclusion: SSAN通过SKE和SPD模块实现了端到端的改进，为视频检索提供了高效且高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of web videos in recent years, large-scale
Content-Based Video Retrieval (CBVR) becomes increasingly essential in video
filtering, recommendation, and copyright protection. Segment-level CBVR
(S-CBVR) locates the start and end time of similar segments in finer
granularity, which is beneficial for user browsing efficiency and infringement
detection especially in long video scenarios. The challenge of S-CBVR task is
how to achieve high temporal alignment accuracy with efficient computation and
low storage consumption. In this paper, we propose a Segment Similarity and
Alignment Network (SSAN) in dealing with the challenge which is firstly trained
end-to-end in S-CBVR. SSAN is based on two newly proposed modules in video
retrieval: (1) An efficient Self-supervised Keyframe Extraction (SKE) module to
reduce redundant frame features, (2) A robust Similarity Pattern Detection
(SPD) module for temporal alignment. In comparison with uniform frame
extraction, SKE not only saves feature storage and search time, but also
introduces comparable accuracy and limited extra computation time. In terms of
temporal alignment, SPD localizes similar segments with higher accuracy and
efficiency than existing deep learning methods. Furthermore, we jointly train
SSAN with SKE and SPD and achieve an end-to-end improvement. Meanwhile, the two
key modules SKE and SPD can also be effectively inserted into other video
retrieval pipelines and gain considerable performance improvements.
Experimental results on public datasets show that SSAN can obtain higher
alignment accuracy while saving storage and online query computational cost
compared to existing methods.

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in real-world applications, a
comprehensive representation of videos becomes increasingly important. In this
paper, we address the problem of video scene recognition, whose goal is to
learn a high-level video representation to classify scenes in videos. Due to
the diversity and complexity of video contents in realistic scenarios, this
task remains a challenge. Most existing works identify scenes for videos only
from visual or textual information in a temporal perspective, ignoring the
valuable information hidden in single frames, while several earlier studies
only recognize scenes for separate images in a non-temporal perspective. We
argue that these two perspectives are both meaningful for this task and
complementary to each other, meanwhile, externally introduced knowledge can
also promote the comprehension of videos. We propose a novel two-stream
framework to model video representations from multiple perspectives, i.e.
temporal and non-temporal perspectives, and integrate the two perspectives in
an end-to-end manner by self-distillation. Besides, we design a
knowledge-enhanced feature fusion and label prediction method that contributes
to naturally introducing knowledge into the task of video scene recognition.
Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method.

Conclusion: Diff-MM通过利用预训练生成模型的先验知识，实现了统一的参数设置和优异的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal object tracking integrates auxiliary modalities such as depth,
thermal infrared, event flow, and language to provide additional information
beyond RGB images, showing great potential in improving tracking stabilization
in complex scenarios. Existing methods typically start from an RGB-based
tracker and learn to understand auxiliary modalities only from training data.
Constrained by the limited multi-modal training data, the performance of these
methods is unsatisfactory. To alleviate this limitation, this work proposes a
unified multi-modal tracker Diff-MM by exploiting the multi-modal understanding
capability of the pre-trained text-to-image generation model. Diff-MM leverages
the UNet of pre-trained Stable Diffusion as a tracking feature extractor
through the proposed parallel feature extraction pipeline, which enables
pairwise image inputs for object tracking. We further introduce a multi-modal
sub-module tuning method that learns to gain complementary information between
different modalities. By harnessing the extensive prior knowledge in the
generation model, we achieve a unified tracker with uniform parameters for
RGB-N/D/T/E tracking. Experimental results demonstrate the promising
performance of our method compared with recently proposed trackers, e.g., its
AUC outperforms OneTracker by 8.3% on TNL2K.

Conclusion: DFPIR通过特征扰动有效解决了任务干扰问题，实现了全能图像修复的高性能。

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to recover clear images from various
degradation types and levels with a unified model. Nonetheless, the significant
variations among degradation types present challenges for training a universal
model, often resulting in task interference, where the gradient update
directions of different tasks may diverge due to shared parameters. To address
this issue, motivated by the routing strategy, we propose DFPIR, a novel
all-in-one image restorer that introduces Degradation-aware Feature
Perturbations(DFP) to adjust the feature space to align with the unified
parameter space. In this paper, the feature perturbations primarily include
channel-wise perturbations and attention-wise perturbations. Specifically,
channel-wise perturbations are implemented by shuffling the channels in
high-dimensional space guided by degradation types, while attention-wise
perturbations are achieved through selective masking in the attention space. To
achieve these goals, we propose a Degradation-Guided Perturbation Block (DGPB)
to implement these two functions, positioned between the encoding and decoding
stages of the encoder-decoder architecture. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DFPIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
all-in-one image restoration tasks including image denoising, image dehazing,
image deraining, motion deblurring, and low-light image enhancement. Our codes

Result: 在ImageNet上的实验显示，SEA在相同效率下迁移性提高8.5%，且适用于商业视觉API和大型视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: SEA为根据资源需求自适应平衡迁移性和效率提供了可能。

Abstract: In surrogate ensemble attacks, using more surrogate models yields higher
transferability but lower resource efficiency. This practical trade-off between
transferability and efficiency has largely limited existing attacks despite
many pre-trained models are easily accessible online. In this paper, we argue
that such a trade-off is caused by an unnecessary common assumption, i.e., all
models should be identical across iterations. By lifting this assumption, we
can use as many surrogates as we want to unleash transferability without
sacrificing efficiency. Concretely, we propose Selective Ensemble Attack (SEA),
which dynamically selects diverse models (from easily accessible pre-trained
models) across iterations based on our new interpretation of decoupling
within-iteration and cross-iteration model diversity.In this way, the number of
within-iteration models is fixed for maintaining efficiency, while only
cross-iteration model diversity is increased for higher transferability.
Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of SEA in various
scenarios. For example, when dynamically selecting 4 from 20 accessible models,
SEA yields 8.5% higher transferability than existing attacks under the same
efficiency. The superiority of SEA also generalizes to real-world systems, such
as commercial vision APIs and large vision-language models. Overall, SEA opens
up the possibility of adaptively balancing transferability and efficiency
according to specific resource requirements.

atomic-resolution electron microscopy offers a potential source of structural

AutoMat combines pattern-adaptive denoising, physics-guided template retrieval,
symmetry-aware atomic reconstruction, fast relaxation and property prediction

first dedicated STEM2Mat-Bench for this task and evaluate performance using
lattice RMSD, formation energy MAE, and structure-matching success rate. By

Abstract: The explosive growth of generative video models has amplified the demand for
reliable copyright preservation of AI-generated content. Despite its popularity
in image synthesis, invisible generative watermarking remains largely
underexplored in video generation. To address this gap, we propose Safe-Sora,
the first framework to embed graphical watermarks directly into the video
generation process. Motivated by the observation that watermarking performance
is closely tied to the visual similarity between the watermark and cover
content, we introduce a hierarchical coarse-to-fine adaptive matching
mechanism. Specifically, the watermark image is divided into patches, each
assigned to the most visually similar video frame, and further localized to the
optimal spatial region for seamless embedding. To enable spatiotemporal fusion
of watermark patches across video frames, we develop a 3D wavelet
transform-enhanced Mamba architecture with a novel spatiotemporal local
scanning strategy, effectively modeling long-range dependencies during
watermark embedding and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first attempt to apply state space models to watermarking, opening new avenues
for efficient and robust watermark protection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Safe-Sora achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of
video quality, watermark fidelity, and robustness, which is largely attributed
to our proposals. We will release our code upon publication.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable potential in advancing
autonomous driving by leveraging multi-modal fusion in order to enhance scene
perception, reasoning, and decision-making. Despite their potential, existing
models suffer from computational overhead and inefficient integration of
multi-view sensor data that make them impractical for real-time deployment in
safety-critical autonomous driving applications. To address these shortcomings,
this paper is devoted to designing a lightweight VLM called TS-VLM, which
incorporates a novel Text-Guided SoftSort Pooling (TGSSP) module. By resorting
to semantics of the input queries, TGSSP ranks and fuses visual features from
multiple views, enabling dynamic and query-aware multi-view aggregation without
reliance on costly attention mechanisms. This design ensures the query-adaptive
prioritization of semantically related views, which leads to improved
contextual accuracy in multi-view reasoning for autonomous driving. Extensive
evaluations on the DriveLM benchmark demonstrate that, on the one hand, TS-VLM
outperforms state-of-the-art models with a BLEU-4 score of 56.82, METEOR of
41.91, ROUGE-L of 74.64, and CIDEr of 3.39. On the other hand, TS-VLM reduces
computational cost by up to 90%, where the smallest version contains only 20.1

autonomous vehicles.

Conclusion: SiD框架在高效蒸馏高分辨率T2I扩散模型方面表现优异，解决了对齐与多样性的权衡问题。

Abstract: Diffusion distillation has emerged as a promising strategy for accelerating
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by distilling a pretrained score network
into a one- or few-step generator. While existing methods have made notable
progress, they often rely on real or teacher-synthesized images to perform well
when distilling high-resolution T2I diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion
XL (SDXL), and their use of classifier-free guidance (CFG) introduces a
persistent trade-off between text-image alignment and generation diversity. We
address these challenges by optimizing Score identity Distillation (SiD) -- a
data-free, one-step distillation framework -- for few-step generation. Backed
by theoretical analysis that justifies matching a uniform mixture of outputs
from all generation steps to the data distribution, our few-step distillation
algorithm avoids step-specific networks and integrates seamlessly into existing
pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SDXL at 1024x1024
resolution. To mitigate the alignment-diversity trade-off when real text-image
pairs are available, we introduce a Diffusion GAN-based adversarial loss
applied to the uniform mixture and propose two new guidance strategies:
Zero-CFG, which disables CFG in the teacher and removes text conditioning in
the fake score network, and Anti-CFG, which applies negative CFG in the fake
score network. This flexible setup improves diversity without sacrificing
alignment. Comprehensive experiments on SD1.5 and SDXL demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in both one-step and few-step generation settings,
along with robustness to the absence of real images. Our efficient PyTorch
implementation, along with the resulting one- and few-step distilled
generators, will be released publicly as a separate branch at

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应多模态融合框架TACOcc，用于3D语义占用预测，通过目标尺度自适应双向对称检索机制和体积渲染监督解决几何-语义不匹配和表面细节丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态3D占用预测性能受限于无效的融合策略（几何-语义不匹配）和稀疏标注导致的表面细节丢失。

Method: 1. 目标尺度自适应双向对称检索机制，动态调整邻域大小以优化跨模态特征对齐；2. 基于3D高斯泼溅的体积渲染管道，通过光一致性监督增强表面细节重建。

Result: 在nuScenes和SemanticKITTI基准测试中验证了TACOcc的有效性。

Conclusion: TACOcc通过自适应融合和体积渲染监督显著提升了3D语义占用预测的性能。

Abstract: The performance of multi-modal 3D occupancy prediction is limited by
ineffective fusion, mainly due to geometry-semantics mismatch from fixed fusion
strategies and surface detail loss caused by sparse, noisy annotations. The
mismatch stems from the heterogeneous scale and distribution of point cloud and
image features, leading to biased matching under fixed neighborhood fusion. To
address this, we propose a target-scale adaptive, bidirectional symmetric
retrieval mechanism. It expands the neighborhood for large targets to enhance
context awareness and shrinks it for small ones to improve efficiency and
suppress noise, enabling accurate cross-modal feature alignment. This mechanism
explicitly establishes spatial correspondences and improves fusion accuracy.
For surface detail loss, sparse labels provide limited supervision, resulting
in poor predictions for small objects. We introduce an improved volume
rendering pipeline based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which takes fused features
as input to render images, applies photometric consistency supervision, and
jointly optimizes 2D-3D consistency. This enhances surface detail
reconstruction while suppressing noise propagation. In summary, we propose
TACOcc, an adaptive multi-modal fusion framework for 3D semantic occupancy
prediction, enhanced by volume rendering supervision. Experiments on the
nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: ALTER为病理学提供了一个灵活且强大的多模态解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology and artificial intelligence have
significantly enhanced the utilization of gigapixel whole-slide images and and
additional modalities (e.g., genomics) for pathological diagnosis. Although
deep learning has demonstrated strong potential in pathology, several key
challenges persist: (1) fusing heterogeneous data types requires sophisticated
strategies beyond simple concatenation due to high computational costs; (2)
common scenarios of missing modalities necessitate flexible strategies that
allow the model to learn robustly in the absence of certain modalities; (3) the
downstream tasks in CPath are diverse, ranging from unimodal to multimodal,
cnecessitating a unified model capable of handling all modalities. To address
these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining
framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports. The term "any"
emphasizes ALTER's modality-adaptive design, enabling flexible pretraining with
any subset of modalities, and its capacity to learn robust, cross-modal
representations beyond WSI-centric approaches. We evaluate ALTER across
extensive clinical tasks including survival prediction, cancer subtyping, gene
mutation prediction, and report generation, achieving superior or comparable
performance to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: VLC Fusion能有效适应环境变化，提升多模态融合性能。

Abstract: Although fusing multiple sensor modalities can enhance object detection
performance, existing fusion approaches often overlook subtle variations in
environmental conditions and sensor inputs. As a result, they struggle to
adaptively weight each modality under such variations. To address this
challenge, we introduce Vision-Language Conditioned Fusion (VLC Fusion), a
novel fusion framework that leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
condition the fusion process on nuanced environmental cues. By capturing
high-level environmental context such as as darkness, rain, and camera
blurring, the VLM guides the model to dynamically adjust modality weights based
on the current scene. We evaluate VLC Fusion on real-world autonomous driving
and military target detection datasets that include image, LIDAR, and mid-wave
infrared modalities. Our experiments show that VLC Fusion consistently
outperforms conventional fusion baselines, achieving improved detection
accuracy in both seen and unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: PST是一种简单、硬件友好的特征融合模块，适用于检测和分类任务。

Abstract: Feature fusion is critical for high-performance vision models but often
incurs prohibitive complexity. However, prevailing attention-based fusion
methods often involve significant computational complexity and implementation
challenges, limiting their efficiency in resource-constrained environments. To
address these issues, we introduce the Pyramid Sparse Transformer (PST), a
lightweight, plug-and-play module that integrates coarse-to-fine token
selection and shared attention parameters to reduce computation while
preserving spatial detail. PST can be trained using only coarse attention and
seamlessly activated at inference for further accuracy gains without
retraining. When added to state-of-the-art real-time detection models, such as
YOLOv11-N/S/M, PST yields mAP improvements of 0.9%, 0.5%, and 0.4% on MS COCO
with minimal latency impact. Likewise, embedding PST into ResNet-18/50/101 as
backbones, boosts ImageNet top-1 accuracy by 6.5%, 1.7%, and 1.0%,

hardware-friendly enhancement for both detection and classification tasks.

Result: 在开放集识别、闭集分类和分布外检测任务中，GradMix优于现有方法，并提升了模型鲁棒性和自监督学习性能。

Conclusion: GradMix通过优化特征学习过程，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Open set recognition (OSR) is devised to address the problem of detecting
novel classes during model inference. Even in recent vision models, this
remains an open issue which is receiving increasing attention. Thereby, a
crucial challenge is to learn features that are relevant for unseen categories
from given data, for which these features might not be discriminative. To
facilitate this process and "optimize to learn" more diverse features, we
propose GradMix, a data augmentation method that dynamically leverages
gradient-based attribution maps of the model during training to mask out
already learned concepts. Thus GradMix encourages the model to learn a more
complete set of representative features from the same data source. Extensive
experiments on open set recognition, close set classification, and
out-of-distribution detection reveal that our method can often outperform the
state-of-the-art. GradMix can further increase model robustness to corruptions
as well as downstream classification performance for self-supervised learning,
indicating its benefit for model generalization.

Abstract: Multi-head detectors typically employ a features-fused-pyramid-neck for
multi-scale detection and are widely adopted in the industry. However, this
approach faces feature misalignment when representations from different
hierarchical levels of the feature pyramid are forcibly fused point-to-point.
To address this issue, we designed an independent hierarchy pyramid (IHP)
architecture to evaluate the effectiveness of the features-unfused-pyramid-neck
for multi-head detectors. Subsequently, we introduced soft nearest neighbor
interpolation (SNI) with a weight downscaling factor to mitigate the impact of
feature fusion at different hierarchies while preserving key textures.
Furthermore, we present a features adaptive selection method for down sampling
in extended spatial windows (ESD) to retain spatial features and enhance
lightweight convolutional techniques (GSConvE). These advancements culminate in
our secondary features alignment solution (SA) for real-time detection,
achieving state-of-the-art results on Pascal VOC and MS COCO. Code will be

generalizability. In this work, we introduce ORQA, a novel OR question
answering benchmark and foundational multimodal model to advance OR

challenges. The proposed multimodal large language model fuses diverse OR

Conclusion: 研究证明了利用人类活动层次结构知识在自我中心视觉中进行多任务推理的潜力。

Abstract: Human activities are particularly complex and variable, and this makes
challenging for deep learning models to reason about them. However, we note
that such variability does have an underlying structure, composed of a
hierarchy of patterns of related actions. We argue that such structure can
emerge naturally from unscripted videos of human activities, and can be
leveraged to better reason about their content. We present HiERO, a
weakly-supervised method to enrich video segments features with the
corresponding hierarchical activity threads. By aligning video clips with their
narrated descriptions, HiERO infers contextual, semantic and temporal reasoning
with an hierarchical architecture. We prove the potential of our enriched
features with multiple video-text alignment benchmarks (EgoMCQ, EgoNLQ) with
minimal additional training, and in zero-shot for procedure learning tasks
(EgoProceL and Ego4D Goal-Step). Notably, HiERO achieves state-of-the-art
performance in all the benchmarks, and for procedure learning tasks it
outperforms fully-supervised methods by a large margin (+12.5% F1 on EgoProceL)
in zero shot. Our results prove the relevance of using knowledge of the
hierarchy of human activities for multiple reasoning tasks in egocentric
vision.

Abstract: Advances in computer vision and deep learning have blurred the line between
deepfakes and authentic media, undermining multimedia credibility through
audio-visual forgery. Current multimodal detection methods remain limited by

performance gains of our model across key evaluation metrics, achieving an

Abstract: As diffusion-based malicious image manipulation becomes increasingly
prevalent, multiple proactive defense methods are developed to safeguard images
against unauthorized tampering. However, most proactive defense methods only
can safeguard images against manipulation under known conditions, and fail to
protect images from manipulations guided by tampering conditions crafted by
malicious users. To tackle this issue, we propose Anti-Inpainting, a proactive
defense method that achieves adequate protection under unknown conditions
through a triple mechanism to address this challenge. Specifically, a
multi-level deep feature extractor is presented to obtain intricate features
during the diffusion denoising process to improve protective effectiveness. We
design multi-scale semantic-preserving data augmentation to enhance the
transferability of adversarial perturbations across unknown conditions by
multi-scale transformations while preserving semantic integrity. In addition,
we propose a selection-based distribution deviation optimization strategy to
improve the protection of adversarial perturbation against manipulation under
diverse random seeds. Extensive experiments indicate the proactive defensive
performance of Anti-Inpainting against diffusion-based inpainters guided by
unknown conditions in InpaintGuardBench and CelebA-HQ. At the same time, we
also demonstrate the proposed approach's robustness under various image
purification methods and its transferability across different versions of
diffusion models.

Abstract: Efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designs have
attracted growing research interests. However, they usually apply single
receptive field (RF), small asymmetric RFs, or pyramid RFs to learn different
feature representations, still encountering two significant challenges in
medical image classification tasks: 1) They have limitations in capturing
diverse lesion characteristics efficiently, e.g., tiny, coordination, small and
salient, which have unique roles on results, especially imbalanced medical
image classification. 2) The predictions generated by those CNNs are often
unfair/biased, bringing a high risk by employing them to real-world medical
diagnosis conditions. To tackle these issues, we develop a new concept,
Expert-Like Reparameterization of Heterogeneous Pyramid Receptive Fields
(ERoHPRF), to simultaneously boost medical image classification performance and
fairness. This concept aims to mimic the multi-expert consultation mode by
applying the well-designed heterogeneous pyramid RF bags to capture different
lesion characteristics effectively via convolution operations with multiple
heterogeneous kernel sizes. Additionally, ERoHPRF introduces an expert-like
structural reparameterization technique to merge its parameters with the
two-stage strategy, ensuring competitive computation cost and inference speed
through comparisons to a single RF. To manifest the effectiveness and
generalization ability of ERoHPRF, we incorporate it into mainstream efficient
CNN architectures. The extensive experiments show that our method maintains a
better trade-off than state-of-the-art methods in terms of medical image
classification, fairness, and computation overhead. The codes of this paper

Abstract: Diffusion models have made breakthroughs in 3D generation tasks. Current 3D
diffusion models focus on reconstructing target shape from images or a set of
partial observations. While excelling in global context understanding, they
struggle to capture the local details of complex shapes and limited to the
occlusion and lighting conditions. To overcome these limitations, we utilize
tactile images to capture the local 3D information and propose a Touch2Shape
model, which leverages a touch-conditioned diffusion model to explore and
reconstruct the target shape from touch. For shape reconstruction, we have
developed a touch embedding module to condition the diffusion model in creating
a compact representation and a touch shape fusion module to refine the
reconstructed shape. For shape exploration, we combine the diffusion model with
reinforcement learning to train a policy. This involves using the generated
latent vector from the diffusion model to guide the touch exploration policy
training through a novel reward design. Experiments validate the reconstruction
quality thorough both qualitatively and quantitative analysis, and our touch
exploration policy further boosts reconstruction performance.

degradation in industrial settings. These challenges raise critical questions:
Can we build a vision foundation model for industrial applications without
relying on real images or manual annotations? And can such models outperform
even fine-tuned SAM on industrial datasets? To address these questions, we
propose the Instance Core Segmentation Dataset (InsCore), a synthetic
pre-training dataset based on formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL).
InsCore generates fully annotated instance segmentation images that reflect key
characteristics of industrial data, including complex occlusions, dense
hierarchical masks, and diverse non-rigid shapes, distinct from typical web
imagery. Unlike previous methods, InsCore requires neither real images nor
human annotations. Experiments on five industrial datasets show that models
pre-trained with InsCore outperform those trained on COCO and ImageNet-21k, as
well as fine-tuned SAM, achieving an average improvement of 6.2 points in
instance segmentation performance. This result is achieved using only 100k
synthetic images, more than 100 times fewer than the 11 million images in SAM's
SA-1B dataset, demonstrating the data efficiency of our approach. These
findings position InsCore as a practical and license-free vision foundation
model for industrial applications.

Motivation: 探讨位置信息在图像分类中的作用，因为其既可能因相机位置任意性而无关紧要，也可能因场景布局（如天空在上）而关键。

Method: 提出Position-SHAP方法量化位置偏差，并设计Auto-PE嵌入方法，动态调整位置嵌入的范数以优化分类。

Result: 发现不同数据集的位置偏差程度不同，Auto-PE能结合现有嵌入方法提升分类准确率。

Conclusion: 位置偏差对视觉Transformer性能至关重要，Auto-PE是一种灵活且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: How discriminative position information is for image classification depends
on the data. On the one hand, the camera position is arbitrary and objects can
appear anywhere in the image, arguing for translation invariance. At the same
time, position information is key for exploiting capture/center bias, and scene
layout, e.g.: the sky is up. We show that position bias, the level to which a
dataset is more easily solved when positional information on input features is
used, plays a crucial role in the performance of Vision Transformers image
classifiers. To investigate, we propose Position-SHAP, a direct measure of
position bias by extending SHAP to work with position embeddings. We show
various levels of position bias in different datasets, and find that the
optimal choice of position embedding depends on the position bias apparent in
the dataset. We therefore propose Auto-PE, a single-parameter position
embedding extension, which allows the position embedding to modulate its norm,
enabling the unlearning of position information. Auto-PE combines with existing
PEs to match or improve accuracy on classification datasets.

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 预计算无条件的流生成模型结果并缓存；2) 使用轻量级模型进行条件预测。

Result: 推理时间缩短至1毫秒，比VAE快4倍，比扩散方法快30倍，同时保持预测精度。

Conclusion: CacheFlow在速度和精度上均优于现有方法，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Many density estimation techniques for 3D human motion prediction require a
significant amount of inference time, often exceeding the duration of the
predicted time horizon. To address the need for faster density estimation for
3D human motion prediction, we introduce a novel flow-based method for human
motion prediction called CacheFlow. Unlike previous conditional generative
models that suffer from time efficiency, CacheFlow takes advantage of an
unconditional flow-based generative model that transforms a Gaussian mixture
into the density of future motions. The results of the computation of the
flow-based generative model can be precomputed and cached. Then, for
conditional prediction, we seek a mapping from historical trajectories to
samples in the Gaussian mixture. This mapping can be done by a much more
lightweight model, thus saving significant computation overhead compared to a
typical conditional flow model. In such a two-stage fashion and by caching
results from the slow flow model computation, we build our CacheFlow without
loss of prediction accuracy and model expressiveness. This inference process is
completed in approximately one millisecond, making it 4 times faster than
previous VAE methods and 30 times faster than previous diffusion-based methods
on standard benchmarks such as Human3.6M and AMASS datasets. Furthermore, our
method demonstrates improved density estimation accuracy and comparable
prediction accuracy to a SOTA method on Human3.6M. Our code and models will be
publicly available.

Result: MRAM不仅实现了更接近人类眼动的注意力动态，还在标准图像分类基准上优于CNN、RAM和DRAM。

Conclusion: MRAM通过模拟人类视觉层次结构，显著提升了硬注意力模型的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Inspired by foveal vision, hard attention models promise interpretability and
parameter economy. However, existing models like the Recurrent Model of Visual
Attention (RAM) and Deep Recurrent Attention Model (DRAM) failed to model the
hierarchy of human vision system, that compromise on the visual exploration
dynamics. As a result, they tend to produce attention that are either overly
fixational or excessively saccadic, diverging from human eye movement behavior.
In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Recurrent Attention Model (MRAM), a
novel hard attention framework that explicitly models the neural hierarchy of
human visual processing. By decoupling the function of glimpse location
generation and task execution in two recurrent layers, MRAM emergent a balanced
behavior between fixation and saccadic movement. Our results show that MRAM not
only achieves more human-like attention dynamics, but also consistently
outperforms CNN, RAM and DRAM baselines on standard image classification
benchmarks.

Abstract: Humans can quickly generalize handwriting styles from a single example by
intuitively separating content from style. Machines, however, struggle with
this task, especially in low-data settings, often missing subtle spatial and
stylistic cues. Motivated by this gap, we introduce WriteViT, a one-shot
handwritten text synthesis framework that incorporates Vision Transformers
(ViT), a family of models that have shown strong performance across various
computer vision tasks. WriteViT integrates a ViT-based Writer Identifier for
extracting style embeddings, a multi-scale generator built with Transformer
encoder-decoder blocks enhanced by conditional positional encoding (CPE), and a
lightweight ViT-based recognizer. While previous methods typically rely on CNNs
or CRNNs, our design leverages transformers in key components to better capture
both fine-grained stroke details and higher-level style information. Although
handwritten text synthesis has been widely explored, its application to
Vietnamese -- a language rich in diacritics and complex typography -- remains
limited. Experiments on Vietnamese and English datasets demonstrate that
WriteViT produces high-quality, style-consistent handwriting while maintaining
strong recognition performance in low-resource scenarios. These results
highlight the promise of transformer-based designs for multilingual handwriting
generation and efficient style adaptation.

Conclusion: 计算机视觉模型支持GT概念的学习解释，但多模态整合可能损害几何敏感性。

Abstract: With the rapid improvement of machine learning (ML) models, cognitive
scientists are increasingly asking about their alignment with how humans think.
Here, we ask this question for computer vision models and human sensitivity to
geometric and topological (GT) concepts. Under the core knowledge account,
these concepts are innate and supported by dedicated neural circuitry. In this
work, we investigate an alternative explanation, that GT concepts are learned
``for free'' through everyday interaction with the environment. We do so using
computer visions models, which are trained on large image datasets. We build on
prior studies to investigate the overall performance and human alignment of
three classes of models -- convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
transformer-based models, and vision-language models -- on an odd-one-out task
testing 43 GT concepts spanning seven classes. Transformer-based models achieve
the highest overall accuracy, surpassing that of young children. They also show
strong alignment with children's performance, finding the same classes of
concepts easy vs. difficult. By contrast, vision-language models underperform
their vision-only counterparts and deviate further from human profiles,
indicating that na\"ive multimodality might compromise abstract geometric
sensitivity. These findings support the use of computer vision models to
evaluate the sufficiency of the learning account for explaining human
sensitivity to GT concepts, while also suggesting that integrating linguistic
and visual representations might have unpredicted deleterious consequences.

Abstract: In recent years, dataset distillation has provided a reliable solution for
data compression, where models trained on the resulting smaller synthetic
datasets achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original
datasets. To further improve the performance of synthetic datasets, various
training pipelines and optimization objectives have been proposed, greatly
advancing the field of dataset distillation. Recent decoupled dataset
distillation methods introduce soft labels and stronger data augmentation
during the post-evaluation phase and scale dataset distillation up to larger
datasets (e.g., ImageNet-1K). However, this raises a question: Is accuracy
still a reliable metric to fairly evaluate dataset distillation methods? Our
empirical findings suggest that the performance improvements of these methods
often stem from additional techniques rather than the inherent quality of the
images themselves, with even randomly sampled images achieving superior
results. Such misaligned evaluation settings severely hinder the development of
DD. Therefore, we propose DD-Ranking, a unified evaluation framework, along
with new general evaluation metrics to uncover the true performance
improvements achieved by different methods. By refocusing on the actual
information enhancement of distilled datasets, DD-Ranking provides a more
comprehensive and fair evaluation standard for future research advancements.

Conclusion: GCRDP能有效解决少样本跨模态检索中的偏差问题，提升检索准确性。

Abstract: Few-shot cross-modal retrieval focuses on learning cross-modal
representations with limited training samples, enabling the model to handle
unseen classes during inference. Unlike traditional cross-modal retrieval
tasks, which assume that both training and testing data share the same class
distribution, few-shot retrieval involves data with sparse representations
across modalities. Existing methods often fail to adequately model the
multi-peak distribution of few-shot cross-modal data, resulting in two main
biases in the latent semantic space: intra-modal bias, where sparse samples
fail to capture intra-class diversity, and inter-modal bias, where
misalignments between image and text distributions exacerbate the semantic gap.
These biases hinder retrieval accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a
novel method, GCRDP, for few-shot cross-modal retrieval. This approach
effectively captures the complex multi-peak distribution of data using a
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and incorporates a multi-positive sample
contrastive learning mechanism for comprehensive feature modeling.
Additionally, we introduce a new strategy for cross-modal semantic alignment,
which constrains the relative distances between image and text feature
distributions, thereby improving the accuracy of cross-modal representations.
We validate our approach through extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets, demonstrating superior performance over six state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Anatomical trees are critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning,
yet their complex and diverse geometry make accurate representation a
significant challenge. Motivated by the latest advances in large language

vocabulary using a VQ-VAE architecture, then models their generation
autoregressively with a GPT-2 model. This method effectively captures intricate
geometries and branching patterns, enabling realistic vascular tree synthesis.
Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveal that our
technique achieves high-fidelity tree reconstruction with compact discrete
representations. Moreover, our B-spline representation of vessel cross-sections
preserves critical morphological details that are often overlooked in previous'
methods parameterizations. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first
to generate blood vessels in an autoregressive manner. Code, data, and trained
models will be made available.

Abstract: Presentation Attack Detection and Face Forgery Detection are designed to
protect face data from physical media-based Presentation Attacks and digital
editing-based DeepFakes respectively. But separate training of these two models
makes them vulnerable to unknown attacks and burdens deployment environments.
The lack of a Unified Face Attack Detection model to handle both types of
attacks is mainly due to two factors. First, there's a lack of adequate
benchmarks for models to explore. Existing UAD datasets have limited attack
types and samples, restricting the model's ability to address advanced threats.
To address this, we propose UniAttackDataPlus (UniAttackData+), the most
extensive and sophisticated collection of forgery techniques to date. It
includes 2,875 identities and their 54 kinds of falsified samples, totaling
697,347 videos. Second, there's a lack of a reliable classification criterion.
Current methods try to find an arbitrary criterion within the same semantic
space, which fails when encountering diverse attacks. So, we present a novel
Visual-Language Model-based Hierarchical Prompt Tuning Framework (HiPTune) that
adaptively explores multiple classification criteria from different semantic
spaces. We build a Visual Prompt Tree to explore various classification rules
hierarchically. Then, by adaptively pruning the prompts, the model can select
the most suitable prompts to guide the encoder to extract discriminative
features at different levels in a coarse-to-fine way. Finally, to help the
model understand the classification criteria in visual space, we propose a
Dynamically Prompt Integration module to project the visual prompts to the text
encoder for more accurate semantics. Experiments on 12 datasets have shown the
potential to inspire further innovations in the UAD field.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) plays a crucial role in visual affective
computing, aiming to infer a person's emotional state based on facial data.
Scientifically, facial expressions (FEs) result from the coordinated movement
of facial muscles, which can be decomposed into specific action units (AUs)
that provide detailed emotional insights. However, traditional methods often
struggle with limited interpretability, constrained generalization and
reasoning abilities. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have

that humans struggle to predict which questions are difficult for machine
learning models. Our automatic approach leverages recent advances in code
generation for visual question answering, using the complexity of generated
code as a proxy for question difficulty. We demonstrate that this measure
correlates significantly better with model performance than human estimates. To
operationalize this insight, we propose an algorithm for estimating question
complexity from code. It identifies fine-grained primitives that correlate with
the hardest questions for any given set of models, making it easy to scale to
new approaches in the future. Finally, to further illustrate the utility of our
method, we extend it to automatically generate complex questions, constructing
a new benchmark that is 1.9 times harder than the popular NExT-QA.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video generation, synthesizing physically
plausible human actions remains a persistent challenge, particularly in
modeling fine-grained semantics and complex temporal dynamics. For instance,
generating gymnastics routines such as "switch leap with 0.5 turn" poses
substantial difficulties for current methods, often yielding unsatisfactory
results. To bridge this gap, we propose FinePhys, a Fine-grained human action
generation framework that incorporates Physics to obtain effective skeletal
guidance. Specifically, FinePhys first estimates 2D poses in an online manner
and then performs 2D-to-3D dimension lifting via in-context learning. To
mitigate the instability and limited interpretability of purely data-driven 3D
poses, we further introduce a physics-based motion re-estimation module
governed by Euler-Lagrange equations, calculating joint accelerations via
bidirectional temporal updating. The physically predicted 3D poses are then
fused with data-driven ones, offering multi-scale 2D heatmap guidance for the
diffusion process. Evaluated on three fine-grained action subsets from FineGym
(FX-JUMP, FX-TURN, and FX-SALTO), FinePhys significantly outperforms
competitive baselines. Comprehensive qualitative results further demonstrate
FinePhys's ability to generate more natural and plausible fine-grained human
actions.

Abstract: Lane Keeping Assist systems, while increasingly prevalent, often suffer from
unpredictable real-world failures, largely due to their opaque, black-box
nature, which limits driver anticipation and trust. To bridge the gap between
automated assistance and effective human oversight, we present LKAlert, a novel
supervisory alert system that leverages VLM to forecast potential LKA risk 1-3
seconds in advance. LKAlert processes dash-cam video and CAN data, integrating
surrogate lane segmentation features from a parallel interpretable model as
automated guiding attention. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, LKAlert
issues both predictive alert and concise natural language explanation,
enhancing driver situational awareness and trust. To support the development
and evaluation of such systems, we introduce OpenLKA-Alert, the first benchmark
dataset designed for predictive and explainable LKA failure warnings. It
contains synchronized multimodal inputs and human-authored justifications
across annotated temporal windows. We further contribute a generalizable
methodological framework for VLM-based black-box behavior prediction, combining
surrogate feature guidance with LoRA. This framework enables VLM to reason over
structured visual context without altering its vision backbone, making it
broadly applicable to other complex, opaque systems requiring interpretable
oversight. Empirical results correctly predicts upcoming LKA failures with
69.8% accuracy and a 58.6\% F1-score. The system also generates high-quality
textual explanations for drivers (71.7 ROUGE-L) and operates efficiently at
approximately 2 Hz, confirming its suitability for real-time, in-vehicle use.
Our findings establish LKAlert as a practical solution for enhancing the safety
and usability of current ADAS and offer a scalable paradigm for applying VLMs
to human-centered supervision of black-box automation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation relies heavily on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and Transformer-based models. However, CNNs are constrained by limited
receptive fields, while Transformers suffer from scalability challenges due to
their quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, recent
advances have explored alternative architectures. The state-space model Mamba
offers near-linear complexity while capturing long-range dependencies, and the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) enhances nonlinear expressiveness by replacing
fixed activation functions with learnable ones. Building on these strengths, we
propose MedVKAN, an efficient feature extraction model integrating Mamba and
KAN. Specifically, we introduce the EFC-KAN module, which enhances KAN with
convolutional operations to improve local pixel interaction. We further design
the VKAN module, integrating Mamba with EFC-KAN as a replacement for
Transformer modules, significantly improving feature extraction. Extensive
experiments on five public medical image segmentation datasets show that
MedVKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets and ranks second
on the remaining one. These results validate the potential of Mamba and KAN for
medical image segmentation while introducing an innovative and computationally
efficient feature extraction framework. The code is available at:

Abstract: AI-enhanced personality assessments are increasingly shaping hiring
decisions, using affective computing to predict traits from the Big Five
(OCEAN) model. However, integrating AI into these assessments raises ethical
concerns, especially around bias amplification rooted in training data. These
biases can lead to discriminatory outcomes based on protected attributes like
gender, ethnicity, and age. To address this, we introduce a
counterfactual-based framework to systematically evaluate and quantify bias in
AI-driven personality assessments. Our approach employs generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to generate counterfactual representations of job applicants by
altering protected attributes, enabling fairness analysis without access to the
underlying model. Unlike traditional bias assessments that focus on unimodal or
static data, our method supports multimodal evaluation-spanning visual, audio,
and textual features. This comprehensive approach is particularly important in
high-stakes applications like hiring, where third-party vendors often provide
AI systems as black boxes. Applied to a state-of-the-art personality prediction
model, our method reveals significant disparities across demographic groups. We
also validate our framework using a protected attribute classifier to confirm
the effectiveness of our counterfactual generation. This work provides a
scalable tool for fairness auditing of commercial AI hiring platforms,
especially in black-box settings where training data and model internals are
inaccessible. Our results highlight the importance of counterfactual approaches
in improving ethical transparency in affective computing.

Abstract: Retinal foundation models have significantly advanced retinal image analysis
by leveraging self-supervised learning to reduce dependence on labeled data
while achieving strong generalization. Many recent approaches enhance retinal
image understanding using report supervision, but obtaining clinical reports is
often costly and challenging. In contrast, metadata (e.g., age, gender) is
widely available and serves as a valuable resource for analyzing disease
progression. To effectively incorporate patient-specific information, we
propose PRETI, a retinal foundation model that integrates metadata-aware
learning with robust self-supervised representation learning. We introduce
Learnable Metadata Embedding (LME), which dynamically refines metadata
representations. Additionally, we construct patient-level data pairs,
associating images from the same individual to improve robustness against
non-clinical variations. To further optimize retinal image representation, we
propose Retina-Aware Adaptive Masking (RAAM), a strategy that selectively
applies masking within the retinal region and dynamically adjusts the masking
ratio during training. PRETI captures both global structures and fine-grained
pathological details, resulting in superior diagnostic performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PRETI achieves state-of-the-art results across
diverse diseases and biomarker predictions using in-house and public data,
indicating the importance of metadata-guided foundation models in retinal
disease analysis. Our code and pretrained model are available at

Abstract: Human behavior is fundamentally shaped by visual perception -- our ability to
interact with the world depends on actively gathering relevant information and
adapting our movements accordingly. Behaviors like searching for objects,
reaching, and hand-eye coordination naturally emerge from the structure of our
sensory system. Inspired by these principles, we introduce Perceptive Dexterous
Control (PDC), a framework for vision-driven dexterous whole-body control with
simulated humanoids. PDC operates solely on egocentric vision for task
specification, enabling object search, target placement, and skill selection
through visual cues, without relying on privileged state information (e.g., 3D
object positions and geometries). This perception-as-interface paradigm enables
learning a single policy to perform multiple household tasks, including
reaching, grasping, placing, and articulated object manipulation. We also show
that training from scratch with reinforcement learning can produce emergent
behaviors such as active search. These results demonstrate how vision-driven
control and complex tasks induce human-like behaviors and can serve as the key
ingredients in closing the perception-action loop for animation, robotics, and
embodied AI.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, labelled retinal imaging data, which presents a
significant challenge in the development of machine learning models for
ophthalmology, hinders progress in the field. To synthesise Colour Fundus
Photographs (CFPs), existing methods primarily relying on predefined disease
labels face significant limitations. However, current methods remain limited,
thus failing to generate images for broader categories with diverse and
fine-grained anatomical structures. To overcome these challenges, we first
introduce an innovative pipeline that creates a large-scale, synthetic
Caption-CFP dataset comprising 1.4 million entries, called RetinaLogos-1400k.
Specifically, RetinaLogos-1400k uses large language models (LLMs) to describe
retinal conditions and key structures, such as optic disc configuration,
vascular distribution, nerve fibre layers, and pathological features.
Furthermore, based on this dataset, we employ a novel three-step training
framework, called RetinaLogos, which enables fine-grained semantic control over
retinal images and accurately captures different stages of disease progression,
subtle anatomical variations, and specific lesion types. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, with 62.07%
of text-driven synthetic images indistinguishable from real ones by
ophthalmologists. Moreover, the synthetic data improves accuracy by 10%-25% in
diabetic retinopathy grading and glaucoma detection, thereby providing a
scalable solution to augment ophthalmic datasets.

Conclusion: 混合方法有效平衡了感知质量和失真，适用于图像和视频压缩。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models achieved impressive results on several image
generation tasks often outperforming GAN based models. Recently, the generative
capabilities of diffusion models have been employed for perceptual image
compression, such as in CDC. A major drawback of these diffusion-based methods
is that, while producing impressive perceptual quality images they are dropping
in fidelity/increasing the distortion to the original uncompressed images when
compared with other traditional or learned image compression schemes aiming for
fidelity. In this paper, we propose a hybrid compression scheme optimized for
perceptual quality, extending the approach of the CDC model with a decoder
network in order to reduce the impact on distortion metrics such as PSNR. After
using the decoder network to generate an initial image, optimized for
distortion, the latent conditioned diffusion model refines the reconstruction
for perceptual quality by predicting the residual. On standard benchmarks, we
achieve up to +2dB PSNR fidelity improvements while maintaining comparable
LPIPS and FID perceptual scores when compared with CDC. Additionally, the
approach is easily extensible to video compression, where we achieve similar
results.

Abstract: Point-cloud semantic segmentation underpins a wide range of critical
applications. Although recent deep architectures and large-scale datasets have
driven impressive closed-set performance, these models struggle to recognize or
properly segment objects outside their training classes. This gap has sparked
interest in Open-Set Semantic Segmentation (O3S), where models must both
correctly label known categories and detect novel, unseen classes. In this
paper, we propose a plug and play framework for O3S. By modeling the
segmentation pipeline as a conditional Markov chain, we derive a novel
regularizer term dubbed Conditional Channel Capacity Maximization (3CM), that
maximizes the mutual information between features and predictions conditioned
on each class. When incorporated into standard loss functions, 3CM encourages
the encoder to retain richer, label-dependent features, thereby enhancing the
network's ability to distinguish and segment previously unseen categories.
Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of proposed method on detecting
unseen objects. We further outline future directions for dynamic open-world
adaptation and efficient information-theoretic estimation.

Conclusion: 该研究为游戏图形质量自动评估奠定了基础，推动了NR-IQA方法在该领域的应用。

Abstract: Assessing the visual quality of video game graphics presents unique
challenges due to the absence of reference images and the distinct types of
distortions, such as aliasing, texture blur, and geometry level of detail (LOD)
issues, which differ from those in natural images or user-generated content.
Existing no-reference image and video quality assessment (NR-IQA/VQA) methods
fail to generalize to gaming environments as they are primarily designed for
distortions like compression artifacts. This study introduces a
semantically-aware NR-IQA model tailored to gaming. The model employs a
knowledge-distilled Game distortion feature extractor (GDFE) to detect and
quantify game-specific distortions, while integrating semantic gating via CLIP
embeddings to dynamically weight feature importance based on scene content.
Training on gameplay data recorded across graphical quality presets enables the
model to produce quality scores that align with human perception. Our results
demonstrate that the GDFE, trained through knowledge distillation from binary
classifiers, generalizes effectively to intermediate distortion levels unseen
during training. Semantic gating further improves contextual relevance and
reduces prediction variance. In the absence of in-domain NR-IQA baselines, our
model outperforms out-of-domain methods and exhibits robust, monotonic quality
trends across unseen games in the same genre. This work establishes a
foundation for automated graphical quality assessment in gaming, advancing
NR-IQA methods in this domain.

Conclusion: ARGS-Diff为高光谱和多光谱图像融合提供了一种高效且无需额外数据的方法。

Abstract: Hyperspectral and multispectral image (HSI-MSI) fusion involves combining a
low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) with a high-resolution
multispectral image (HR-MSI) to generate a high-resolution hyperspectral image
(HR-HSI). Most deep learning-based methods for HSI-MSI fusion rely on large
amounts of hyperspectral data for supervised training, which is often scarce in
practical applications. In this paper, we propose a self-learning Adaptive
Residual Guided Subspace Diffusion Model (ARGS-Diff), which only utilizes the
observed images without any extra training data. Specifically, as the LR-HSI
contains spectral information and the HR-MSI contains spatial information, we
design two lightweight spectral and spatial diffusion models to separately
learn the spectral and spatial distributions from them. Then, we use these two
models to reconstruct HR-HSI from two low-dimensional components, i.e, the
spectral basis and the reduced coefficient, during the reverse diffusion
process. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Residual Guided Module (ARGM),
which refines the two components through a residual guided function at each
sampling step, thereby stabilizing the sampling process. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that ARGS-Diff outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods in terms of both performance and computational efficiency in the field
of HSI-MSI fusion. Code is available at https://github.com/Zhu1116/ARGS-Diff.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same
geographic location captured from different perspectives, such as drones and
satellites. Despite recent advances, CVGL remains highly challenging due to
significant appearance changes and spatial distortions caused by viewpoint
variations. Existing methods typically assume that cross-view images can be
directly aligned within a shared feature space by maximizing feature similarity
through contrastive learning. Nonetheless, this assumption overlooks the
inherent conflicts induced by viewpoint discrepancies, resulting in extracted
features containing inconsistent information that hinders precise localization.
In this study, we take a manifold learning perspective and model the feature
space of cross-view images as a composite manifold jointly governed by content
and viewpoint information. Building upon this insight, we propose
$\textbf{CVD}$, a new CVGL framework that explicitly disentangles
$\textit{content}$ and $\textit{viewpoint}$ factors. To promote effective
disentanglement, we introduce two constraints: $\textit{(i)}$ An intra-view
independence constraint, which encourages statistical independence between the
two factors by minimizing their mutual information. $\textit{(ii)}$ An
inter-view reconstruction constraint that reconstructs each view by
cross-combining $\textit{content}$ and $\textit{viewpoint}$ from paired images,
ensuring factor-specific semantics are preserved. As a plug-and-play module,
CVD can be seamlessly integrated into existing geo-localization pipelines.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks, i.e., University-1652, SUES-200,
CVUSA, and CVACT, demonstrate that CVD consistently improves both localization
accuracy and generalization across multiple baselines.

Abstract: The efficient rendering and explicit nature of 3DGS promote the advancement
of 3D scene manipulation. However, existing methods typically encounter
challenges in controlling the manipulation region and are unable to furnish the
user with interactive feedback, which inevitably leads to unexpected results.
Intuitively, incorporating interactive 3D segmentation tools can compensate for
this deficiency. Nevertheless, existing segmentation frameworks impose a
pre-processing step of scene-specific parameter training, which limits the
efficiency and flexibility of scene manipulation. To deliver a 3D region
control module that is well-suited for scene manipulation with reliable
efficiency, we propose interactive Segment-and-Manipulate 3D Gaussians
(iSegMan), an interactive segmentation and manipulation framework that only
requires simple 2D user interactions in any view. To propagate user
interactions to other views, we propose Epipolar-guided Interaction Propagation
(EIP), which innovatively exploits epipolar constraint for efficient and robust
interaction matching. To avoid scene-specific training to maintain efficiency,
we further propose the novel Visibility-based Gaussian Voting (VGV), which
obtains 2D segmentations from SAM and models the region extraction as a voting
game between 2D Pixels and 3D Gaussians based on Gaussian visibility. Taking
advantage of the efficient and precise region control of EIP and VGV, we put
forth a Manipulation Toolbox to implement various functions on selected
regions, enhancing the controllability, flexibility and practicality of scene
manipulation. Extensive results on 3D scene manipulation and segmentation tasks
fully demonstrate the significant advantages of iSegMan. Project page is

We introduce SpatialCrafter, a framework that leverages the rich knowledge in
video diffusion models to generate plausible additional observations, thereby
alleviating reconstruction ambiguity. Through a trainable camera encoder and an
epipolar attention mechanism for explicit geometric constraints, we achieve
precise camera control and 3D consistency, further reinforced by a unified
scale estimation strategy to handle scale discrepancies across datasets.
Furthermore, by integrating monocular depth priors with semantic features in
the video latent space, our framework directly regresses 3D Gaussian primitives
and efficiently processes long-sequence features using a hybrid network
structure. Extensive experiments show our method enhances sparse view
reconstruction and restores the realistic appearance of 3D scenes.

Abstract: Creating a realistic clothed human from a single-view RGB image is crucial
for applications like mixed reality and filmmaking. Despite some progress in
recent years, mainstream methods often fail to fully utilize side-view

inconsistency in side views. To address these, we introduce Clothed Human
Reconstruction with Side View Consistency, namely CHRIS, which consists of 1) A
Side-View Normal Discriminator that enhances global visual reasonability by
distinguishing the generated side-view normals from the ground truth ones; 2) A
Multi-to-One Gradient Computation (M2O) that ensures local surface consistency.
M2O calculates the gradient of a sampling point by integrating the gradients of
the nearby points, effectively acting as a smooth operation. Experimental
results demonstrate that CHRIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on public

Abstract: Expressive human pose and shape (EHPS) estimation is vital for digital human
generation, particularly in live-streaming applications. However, most existing
EHPS models focus primarily on minimizing estimation errors, with limited
attention on potential security vulnerabilities. Current adversarial attacks on
EHPS models often require white-box access (e.g., model details or gradients)
or generate visually conspicuous perturbations, limiting their practicality and
ability to expose real-world security threats. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel Unnoticeable Black-Box Attack (UBA) against EHPS models. UBA
leverages the latent-space representations of natural images to generate an
optimal adversarial noise pattern and iteratively refine its attack potency
along an optimized direction in digital space. Crucially, this process relies
solely on querying the model's output, requiring no internal knowledge of the
EHPS architecture, while guiding the noise optimization toward greater stealth
and effectiveness. Extensive experiments and visual analyses demonstrate the
superiority of UBA. Notably, UBA increases the pose estimation errors of EHPS
models by 17.27%-58.21% on average, revealing critical vulnerabilities. These
findings underscore the urgent need to address and mitigate security risks
associated with digital human generation systems.

Abstract: Very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery has emerged as a powerful tool
for monitoring marine animals on a large scale. However, existing deep
learning-based whale detection methods usually require manually created,
high-quality bounding box annotations, which are labor-intensive to produce.
Moreover, existing studies often exclude ``uncertain whales'', individuals that
have ambiguous appearances in satellite imagery, limiting the applicability of
these models in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this study
introduces an automated pipeline for detecting beluga whales and harp seals in
VHR satellite imagery. The pipeline leverages point annotations and the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) to generate precise bounding box annotations, which are
used to train YOLOv8 for multiclass detection of certain whales, uncertain
whales, and harp seals. Experimental results demonstrated that SAM-generated
annotations significantly improved detection performance, achieving higher
$\text{F}_\text{1}$-scores compared to traditional buffer-based annotations.
YOLOv8 trained on SAM-labeled boxes achieved an overall
$\text{F}_\text{1}$-score of 72.2% for whales overall and 70.3% for harp seals,
with superior performance in dense scenes. The proposed approach not only
reduces the manual effort required for annotation but also enhances the
detection of uncertain whales, offering a more comprehensive solution for
marine animal monitoring. This method holds great potential for extending to
other species, habitats, and remote sensing platforms, as well as for
estimating whale biometrics, thereby advancing ecological monitoring and
conservation efforts. The codes for our label and detection pipeline are
publicly available at http://github.com/voyagerxvoyagerx/beluga-seeker .

Abstract: The dynamic movement of the human body presents a fundamental challenge for
human pose estimation and body segmentation. State-of-the-art approaches
primarily rely on combining keypoint heatmaps with segmentation masks but often
struggle in scenarios involving overlapping joints or rapidly changing poses
during instance-level segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose
Keypoints as Dynamic Centroid (KDC), a new centroid-based representation for
unified human pose estimation and instance-level segmentation. KDC adopts a
bottom-up paradigm to generate keypoint heatmaps for both easily
distinguishable and complex keypoints and improves keypoint detection and
confidence scores by introducing KeyCentroids using a keypoint disk. It
leverages high-confidence keypoints as dynamic centroids in the embedding space
to generate MaskCentroids, allowing for swift clustering of pixels to specific
human instances during rapid body movements in live environments. Our
experimental evaluations on the CrowdPose, OCHuman, and COCO benchmarks
demonstrate KDC's effectiveness and generalizability in challenging scenarios
in terms of both accuracy and runtime performance. The implementation is

Abstract: Recent years have seen a significant increase in video content creation and
consumption. Crafting engaging content requires the careful curation of both
visual and audio elements. While visual cue curation, through techniques like
optimal viewpoint selection or post-editing, has been central to media
production, its natural counterpart, audio, has not undergone equivalent
advancements. This often results in a disconnect between visual and acoustic
saliency. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task: visually-guided
acoustic highlighting, which aims to transform audio to deliver appropriate
highlighting effects guided by the accompanying video, ultimately creating a
more harmonious audio-visual experience. We propose a flexible,
transformer-based multimodal framework to solve this task. To train our model,
we also introduce a new dataset -- the muddy mix dataset, leveraging the
meticulous audio and video crafting found in movies, which provides a form of
free supervision. We develop a pseudo-data generation process to simulate
poorly mixed audio, mimicking real-world scenarios through a three-step process
-- separation, adjustment, and remixing. Our approach consistently outperforms
several baselines in both quantitative and subjective evaluation. We also
systematically study the impact of different types of contextual guidance and
difficulty levels of the dataset. Our project page is here:

Conclusion: ACDepth通过数据生成和知识蒸馏策略显著提升了恶劣天气下的深度估计性能。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is critical for applications such as autonomous
driving and scene reconstruction. While existing methods perform well under
normal scenarios, their performance declines in adverse weather, due to
challenging domain shifts and difficulties in extracting scene information. To
address this issue, we present a robust monocular depth estimation method
called \textbf{ACDepth} from the perspective of high-quality training data
generation and domain adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a one-step
diffusion model for generating samples that simulate adverse weather
conditions, constructing a multi-tuple degradation dataset during training. To
ensure the quality of the generated degradation samples, we employ LoRA
adapters to fine-tune the generation weights of diffusion model. Additionally,
we integrate circular consistency loss and adversarial training to guarantee
the fidelity and naturalness of the scene contents. Furthermore, we elaborate
on a multi-granularity knowledge distillation strategy (MKD) that encourages
the student network to absorb knowledge from both the teacher model and
pretrained Depth Anything V2. This strategy guides the student model in
learning degradation-agnostic scene information from various degradation
inputs. In particular, we introduce an ordinal guidance distillation mechanism
(OGD) that encourages the network to focus on uncertain regions through
differential ranking, leading to a more precise depth estimation. Experimental
results demonstrate that our ACDepth surpasses md4all-DD by 2.50\% for night
scene and 2.61\% for rainy scene on the nuScenes dataset in terms of the absRel
metric.

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction of cortical surfaces from MRI for
morphometric analysis is fundamental for understanding brain structure. While
high-field MRI (HF-MRI) is standard in research and clinical settings, its
limited availability hinders widespread use. Low-field MRI (LF-MRI),
particularly portable systems, offers a cost-effective and accessible
alternative. However, existing cortical surface analysis tools are optimized
for high-resolution HF-MRI and struggle with the lower signal-to-noise ratio
and resolution of LF-MRI. In this work, we present a machine learning method
for 3D reconstruction and analysis of portable LF-MRI across a range of
contrasts and resolutions. Our method works "out of the box" without
retraining. It uses a 3D U-Net trained on synthetic LF-MRI to predict signed
distance functions of cortical surfaces, followed by geometric processing to
ensure topological accuracy. We evaluate our method using paired HF/LF-MRI
scans of the same subjects, showing that LF-MRI surface reconstruction accuracy
depends on acquisition parameters, including contrast type (T1 vs T2),
orientation (axial vs isotropic), and resolution. A 3mm isotropic T2-weighted
scan acquired in under 4 minutes, yields strong agreement with HF-derived
surfaces: surface area correlates at r=0.96, cortical parcellations reach
Dice=0.98, and gray matter volume achieves r=0.93. Cortical thickness remains
more challenging with correlations up to r=0.70, reflecting the difficulty of
sub-mm precision with 3mm voxels. We further validate our method on challenging
postmortem LF-MRI, demonstrating its robustness. Our method represents a step
toward enabling cortical surface analysis on portable LF-MRI. Code is available

Abstract: The diffusion model has provided a strong tool for implementing text-to-image
(T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation. Recently, topology and texture
control are popular explorations, e.g., ControlNet, IP-Adapter, Ctrl-X, and
DSG. These methods explicitly consider high-fidelity controllable editing based
on external signals or diffusion feature manipulations. As for diversity, they
directly choose different noise latents. However, the diffused noise is capable
of implicitly representing the topological and textural manifold of the
corresponding image. Moreover, it's an effective workbench to conduct the
trade-off between content preservation and controllable variations. Previous
T2I and I2I diffusion works do not explore the information within the
compressed contextual latent. In this paper, we first propose a plug-and-play
noise finetune NOFT module employed by Stable Diffusion to generate highly
correlated and diverse images. We fine-tune seed noise or inverse noise through
an optimal-transported (OT) information bottleneck (IB) with around only 14K
trainable parameters and 10 minutes of training. Our test-time NOFT is good at
producing high-fidelity image variations considering topology and texture
alignments. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NOFT is a powerful
general reimagine approach to efficiently fine-tune the 2D/3D AIGC assets with
text or image guidance.

Abstract: Online scene perception and topology reasoning are critical for autonomous
vehicles to understand their driving environments, particularly for mapless
driving systems that endeavor to reduce reliance on costly High-Definition (HD)
maps. However, recent advances in online scene understanding still face
limitations, especially in long-range or occluded scenarios, due to the
inherent constraints of onboard sensors. To address this challenge, we propose
a Standard-Definition (SD) Map Enhanced scene Perception and Topology reasoning
(SEPT) framework, which explores how to effectively incorporate the SD map as
prior knowledge into existing perception and reasoning pipelines. Specifically,
we introduce a novel hybrid feature fusion strategy that combines SD maps with
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, considering both rasterized and vectorized
representations, while mitigating potential misalignment between SD maps and
BEV feature spaces. Additionally, we leverage the SD map characteristics to
design an auxiliary intersection-aware keypoint detection task, which further
enhances the overall scene understanding performance. Experimental results on
the large-scale OpenLane-V2 dataset demonstrate that by effectively integrating
SD map priors, our framework significantly improves both scene perception and
topology reasoning, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion plays a crucial role in medical diagnosis by
integrating complementary information from different modalities to enhance
image readability and clinical applicability. However, existing methods mainly
follow computer vision standards for feature extraction and fusion strategy
formulation, overlooking the rich semantic information inherent in medical
images. To address this limitation, we propose a novel semantic-guided medical
image fusion approach that, for the first time, incorporates medical prior
knowledge into the fusion process. Specifically, we construct a publicly
available multimodal medical image-text dataset, upon which text descriptions
generated by BiomedGPT are encoded and semantically aligned with image features
in a high-dimensional space via a semantic interaction alignment module. During
this process, a cross attention based linear transformation automatically maps
the relationship between textual and visual features to facilitate
comprehensive learning. The aligned features are then embedded into a
text-injection module for further feature-level fusion. Unlike traditional
methods, we further generate diagnostic reports from the fused images to assess
the preservation of medical information. Additionally, we design a medical
semantic loss function to enhance the retention of textual cues from the source
images. Experimental results on test datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations while preserving more critical medical information.

Abstract: The proliferation of diverse remote sensing data has spurred advancements in
dense prediction tasks, yet significant challenges remain in handling data
heterogeneity. Remote sensing imagery exhibits substantial variability across
temporal, spectral, and spatial (TSS) dimensions, complicating unified data
processing. Current deep learning models for dense prediction tasks, such as
semantic segmentation and change detection, are typically tailored to specific
input-output configurations. Consequently, variations in data dimensionality or
task requirements often lead to significant performance degradation or model
incompatibility, necessitating costly retraining or fine-tuning efforts for
different application scenarios. This paper introduces the
Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Network (TSSUN), a novel architecture
designed for unified representation and modeling of remote sensing data across
diverse TSS characteristics and task types. TSSUN employs a
Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Strategy that leverages meta-information to
decouple and standardize input representations from varied temporal, spectral,
and spatial configurations, and similarly unifies output structures for
different dense prediction tasks and class numbers. Furthermore, a Local-Global
Window Attention mechanism is proposed to efficiently capture both local
contextual details and global dependencies, enhancing the model's adaptability
and feature extraction capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets
demonstrate that a single TSSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous
inputs and unifies various dense prediction tasks. The proposed approach
consistently achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance, highlighting
its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing applications
without requiring task-specific modifications.

Abstract: Few-shot classification of hyperspectral images (HSI) faces the challenge of
scarce labeled samples. Self-Supervised learning (SSL) and Few-Shot Learning
(FSL) offer promising avenues to address this issue. However, existing methods
often struggle to adapt to the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs and lack
sufficient spectral prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
method, Spectral-Spatial Self-Supervised Learning for Few-Shot Hyperspectral
Image Classification (S4L-FSC), aimed at improving the performance of few-shot
HSI classification. Specifically, we first leverage heterogeneous datasets to
pretrain a spatial feature extractor using a designed Rotation-Mirror
Self-Supervised Learning (RM-SSL) method, combined with FSL. This approach
enables the model to learn the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs using
rotation and mirroring labels as supervisory signals, while acquiring
transferable spatial meta-knowledge through few-shot learning. Subsequently,
homogeneous datasets are utilized to pretrain a spectral feature extractor via
a combination of FSL and Masked Reconstruction Self-Supervised Learning
(MR-SSL). The model learns to reconstruct original spectral information from
randomly masked spectral vectors, inferring spectral dependencies. In parallel,
FSL guides the model to extract pixel-level discriminative features, thereby
embedding rich spectral priors into the model. This spectral-spatial
pretraining method, along with the integration of knowledge from heterogeneous
and homogeneous sources, significantly enhances model performance. Extensive
experiments on four HSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of the proposed S4L-FSC approach for few-shot HSI classification.

Abstract: This work focuses on Clothes Changing Re-IDentification (CC-ReID) for the
real world. Existing works perform well with high-quality (HQ) images, but
struggle with low-quality (LQ) where we can have artifacts like pixelation,
out-of-focus blur, and motion blur. These artifacts introduce noise to not only
external biometric attributes (e.g. pose, body shape, etc.) but also corrupt
the model's internal feature representation. Models usually cluster LQ image
features together, making it difficult to distinguish between them, leading to
incorrect matches. We propose a novel framework Robustness against Low-Quality
(RLQ) to improve CC-ReID model on real-world data. RLQ relies on Coarse
Attributes Prediction (CAP) and Task Agnostic Distillation (TAD) operating in
alternate steps in a novel training mechanism. CAP enriches the model with
external fine-grained attributes via coarse predictions, thereby reducing the
effect of noisy inputs. On the other hand, TAD enhances the model's internal
feature representation by bridging the gap between HQ and LQ features, via an
external dataset through task-agnostic self-supervision and distillation. RLQ
outperforms the existing approaches by 1.6%-2.9% Top-1 on real-world datasets
like LaST, and DeepChange, while showing consistent improvement of 5.3%-6%
Top-1 on PRCC with competitive performance on LTCC. *The code will be made

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上，HaarMoDic在MPJPE指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HaarMoDic通过同时利用时空信息，显著提升了3D人体姿态预测的精度。

Abstract: The 3D human pose is vital for modern computer vision and computer graphics,
and its prediction has drawn attention in recent years. 3D human pose
prediction aims at forecasting a human's future motion from the previous
sequence. Ignoring that the arbitrariness of human motion sequences has a firm
origin in transition in both temporal and spatial axes limits the performance
of state-of-the-art methods, leading them to struggle with making precise
predictions on complex cases, e.g., arbitrarily posing or greeting. To
alleviate this problem, a network called HaarMoDic is proposed in this paper,
which utilizes the 2D Haar transform to project joints to higher resolution
coordinates where the network can access spatial and temporal information
simultaneously. An ablation study proves that the significant contributing
module within the HaarModic Network is the Multi-Resolution Haar (MR-Haar)
block. Instead of mining in one of two axes or extracting separately, the
MR-Haar block projects whole motion sequences to a mixed-up coordinate in
higher resolution with 2D Haar Transform, allowing the network to give scope to
information from both axes in different resolutions. With the MR-Haar block,
the HaarMoDic network can make predictions referring to a broader range of
information. Experimental results demonstrate that HaarMoDic surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in every testing interval on the Human3.6M dataset in
the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) metric.

Abstract: Recently, significant advances have been made in 3D object generation.
Building upon the generated geometry, current pipelines typically employ image
diffusion models to generate multi-view RGB images, followed by UV texture
reconstruction through texture baking. While 3D geometry generation has
improved significantly, supported by multiple open-source frameworks, 3D
texture generation remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically
investigate 3D texture generation through the lens of three core dimensions:
reference-texture alignment, geometry-texture consistency, and local texture
quality. To tackle these issues, we propose MVPainter, which employs data
filtering and augmentation strategies to enhance texture fidelity and detail,
and introduces ControlNet-based geometric conditioning to improve
texture-geometry alignment. Furthermore, we extract physically-based rendering
(PBR) attributes from the generated views to produce PBR meshes suitable for
real-world rendering applications. MVPainter achieves state-of-the-art results
across all three dimensions, as demonstrated by human-aligned evaluations. To
facilitate further research and reproducibility, we also release our full
pipeline as an open-source system, including data construction, model
architecture, and evaluation tools.

Abstract: Although dual-stream architectures have achieved remarkable success in single
image reflection removal, they fail to fully exploit inter-layer
complementarity in their physical modeling and network design, which limits the
quality of image separation. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose
two targeted improvements to enhance dual-stream architectures: First, we
introduce a novel inter-layer complementarity model where low-frequency
components extracted from the residual layer interact with the transmission
layer through dual-stream architecture to enhance inter-layer complementarity.
Meanwhile, high-frequency components from the residual layer provide inverse
modulation to both streams, improving the detail quality of the transmission
layer. Second, we propose an efficient inter-layer complementarity attention
mechanism which first cross-reorganizes dual streams at the channel level to
obtain reorganized streams with inter-layer complementary structures, then
performs attention computation on the reorganized streams to achieve better
inter-layer separation, and finally restores the original stream structure for
output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art separation quality on multiple public datasets while
significantly reducing both computational cost and model complexity.

Conclusion: F-SUM是预测人类场景理解时间的新指标，凸显了中心凹视觉处理在理解难度中的重要性。

Abstract: Although models exist that predict human response times (RTs) in tasks such
as target search and visual discrimination, the development of image-computable
predictors for scene understanding time remains an open challenge. Recent
advances in vision-language models (VLMs), which can generate scene
descriptions for arbitrary images, combined with the availability of
quantitative metrics for comparing linguistic descriptions, offer a new
opportunity to model human scene understanding. We hypothesize that the primary
bottleneck in human scene understanding and the driving source of variability
in response times across scenes is the interaction between the foveated nature
of the human visual system and the spatial distribution of task-relevant visual
information within an image. Based on this assumption, we propose a novel
image-computable model that integrates foveated vision with VLMs to produce a
spatially resolved map of scene understanding as a function of fixation
location (Foveated Scene Understanding Map, or F-SUM), along with an aggregate
F-SUM score. This metric correlates with average (N=17) human RTs (r=0.47) and
number of saccades (r=0.51) required to comprehend a scene (across 277 scenes).
The F-SUM score also correlates with average (N=16) human description accuracy
(r=-0.56) in time-limited presentations. These correlations significantly
exceed those of standard image-based metrics such as clutter, visual
complexity, and scene ambiguity based on language entropy. Together, our work
introduces a new image-computable metric for predicting human response times in
scene understanding and demonstrates the importance of foveated visual
processing in shaping comprehension difficulty.

Conclusion: Long-RVOS和ReferMo为未来RVOS研究提供了更现实的长期视频基准和解决方案。

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to identify, track and
segment the objects in a video based on language descriptions, which has
received great attention in recent years. However, existing datasets remain
focus on short video clips within several seconds, with salient objects visible
in most frames. To advance the task towards more practical scenarios, we
introduce \textbf{Long-RVOS}, a large-scale benchmark for long-term referring
video object segmentation. Long-RVOS contains 2,000+ videos of an average
duration exceeding 60 seconds, covering a variety of objects that undergo
occlusion, disappearance-reappearance and shot changing. The objects are
manually annotated with three different types of descriptions to individually
evaluate the understanding of static attributes, motion patterns and
spatiotemporal relationships. Moreover, unlike previous benchmarks that rely
solely on the per-frame spatial evaluation, we introduce two new metrics to
assess the temporal and spatiotemporal consistency. We benchmark 6
state-of-the-art methods on Long-RVOS. The results show that current approaches
struggle severely with the long-video challenges. To address this, we further
propose ReferMo, a promising baseline method that integrates motion information
to expand the temporal receptive field, and employs a local-to-global
architecture to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies.
Despite simplicity, ReferMo achieves significant improvements over current
methods in long-term scenarios. We hope that Long-RVOS and our baseline can
drive future RVOS research towards tackling more realistic and long-form
videos.

Abstract: Understanding people's preferences and needs is crucial for urban planning
decisions, yet current approaches often combine them from multi-cultural and
multi-city populations, obscuring important demographic differences and risking
amplifying biases. We conducted a large-scale urban visual perception survey of
streetscapes worldwide using street view imagery, examining how demographics --
including gender, age, income, education, race and ethnicity, and, for the
first time, personality traits -- shape perceptions among 1,000 participants,
with balanced demographics, from five countries and 45 nationalities. This
dataset, introduced as Street Perception Evaluation Considering Socioeconomics
(SPECS), exhibits statistically significant differences in perception scores in
six traditionally used indicators (safe, lively, wealthy, beautiful, boring,
and depressing) and four new ones we propose (live nearby, walk, cycle, green)
among demographics and personalities. We revealed that location-based
sentiments are carried over in people's preferences when comparing urban
streetscapes with other cities. Further, we compared the perception scores
based on where participants and streetscapes are from. We found that an
off-the-shelf machine learning model trained on an existing global perception
dataset tends to overestimate positive indicators and underestimate negative
ones compared to human responses, suggesting that targeted intervention should
consider locals' perception. Our study aspires to rectify the myopic treatment
of street perception, which rarely considers demographics or personality

Our method has the potential to improve the readability of handwritten fonts,

Abstract: Image degradation synthesis is highly desirable in a wide variety of
applications ranging from image restoration to simulating artistic effects.
Existing models are designed to generate one specific or a narrow set of
degradations, which often require user-provided degradation parameters. As a
result, they lack the generalizability to synthesize degradations beyond their
initial design or adapt to other applications. Here we propose the first
universal degradation model that can synthesize a broad spectrum of complex and
realistic degradations containing both homogeneous (global) and inhomogeneous
(spatially varying) components. Our model automatically extracts and
disentangles homogeneous and inhomogeneous degradation features, which are
later used for degradation synthesis without user intervention. A
disentangle-by-compression method is proposed to separate degradation
information from images. Two novel modules for extracting and incorporating
inhomogeneous degradations are created to model inhomogeneous components in
complex degradations. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and adaptability in
film-grain simulation and blind image restoration tasks. The demo video, code,

Abstract: Multi-modal semantic segmentation (MMSS) faces significant challenges in
real-world scenarios due to dynamic environments, sensor failures, and noise

performance. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework called
RobustSeg, which enhances multi-modal robustness through two key components:
the Hybrid Prototype Distillation Module (HPDM) and the Representation
Regularization Module (RRM). In the first stage, RobustSeg pre-trains a
multi-modal teacher model using complete modalities. In the second stage, a
student model is trained with random modality dropout while learning from the
teacher via HPDM and RRM. HPDM transforms features into compact prototypes,
enabling cross-modal hybrid knowledge distillation and mitigating bias from
missing modalities. RRM reduces representation discrepancies between the
teacher and student by optimizing functional entropy through the log-Sobolev
inequality. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that
RobustSeg outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements

Abstract: Existing tracking algorithms typically rely on low-frame-rate RGB cameras
coupled with computationally intensive deep neural network architectures to
achieve effective tracking. However, such frame-based methods inherently face
challenges in achieving low-latency performance and often fail in
resource-constrained environments. Visual object tracking using bio-inspired
event cameras has emerged as a promising research direction in recent years,
offering distinct advantages for low-latency applications. In this paper, we
propose a novel Slow-Fast Tracking paradigm that flexibly adapts to different
operational requirements, termed SFTrack. The proposed framework supports two
complementary modes, i.e., a high-precision slow tracker for scenarios with
sufficient computational resources, and an efficient fast tracker tailored for
latency-aware, resource-constrained environments. Specifically, our framework
first performs graph-based representation learning from
high-temporal-resolution event streams, and then integrates the learned
graph-structured information into two FlashAttention-based vision backbones,
yielding the slow and fast trackers, respectively. The fast tracker achieves
low latency through a lightweight network design and by producing multiple
bounding box outputs in a single forward pass. Finally, we seamlessly combine
both trackers via supervised fine-tuning and further enhance the fast tracker's
performance through a knowledge distillation strategy. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks, including FE240, COESOT, and EventVOT, demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method across different real-world
scenarios. The source code has been released on

Abstract: Event-based Vision Sensors (EVS) have demonstrated significant advantages
over traditional RGB frame-based cameras in low-light conditions, high-speed
motion capture, and low latency. Consequently, object detection based on EVS
has attracted increasing attention from researchers. Current event stream
object detection algorithms are typically built upon Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) or Transformers, which either capture limited local features
using convolutional filters or incur high computational costs due to the
utilization of self-attention. Recently proposed vision heat conduction
backbone networks have shown a good balance between efficiency and accuracy;
however, these models are not specifically designed for event stream data. They
exhibit weak capability in modeling object contour information and fail to
exploit the benefits of multi-scale features. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a novel dynamic graph induced contour-aware heat conduction
network for event stream based object detection, termed CvHeat-DET. The
proposed model effectively leverages the clear contour information inherent in
event streams to predict the thermal diffusivity coefficients within the heat
conduction model, and integrates hierarchical structural graph features to
enhance feature learning across multiple scales. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets for event stream-based object detection fully validated the
effectiveness of the proposed model. The source code of this paper will be

Conclusion: 提出的INN框架有效解决了LDMs在图像恢复中的关键挑战，提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) for
image restoration (IR) tasks due to their ability to model effectively the
distribution of natural images. While significant progress has been made, there
are still key challenges that need to be addressed. First, many approaches
depend on a predefined degradation operator, making them ill-suited for complex
or unknown degradations that deviate from standard analytical models. Second,
many methods struggle to provide a stable guidance in the latent space and
finally most methods convert latent representations back to the pixel domain
for guidance at every sampling iteration, which significantly increases
computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
a wavelet-inspired invertible neural network (INN) that simulates degradations
through a forward transform and reconstructs lost details via the inverse
transform. We further integrate this design into a latent diffusion pipeline
through two proposed approaches: LatentINDIGO-PixelINN, which operates in the
pixel domain, and LatentINDIGO-LatentINN, which stays fully in the latent space
to reduce complexity. Both approaches alternate between updating intermediate
latent variables under the guidance of our INN and refining the INN forward
model to handle unknown degradations. In addition, a regularization step
preserves the proximity of latent variables to the natural image manifold.
Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world low-quality images, and can be readily
adapted to arbitrary output sizes.

Abstract: Aiming to generalize the well-trained gaze estimation model to new target
domains, Cross-domain Gaze Estimation (CDGE) is developed for real-world
application scenarios. Existing CDGE methods typically extract the
domain-invariant features to mitigate domain shift in feature space, which is
proved insufficient by Generalized Label Shift (GLS) theory. In this paper, we
introduce a novel GLS perspective to CDGE and modelize the cross-domain problem
by label and conditional shift problem. A GLS correction framework is presented
and a feasible realization is proposed, in which a importance reweighting
strategy based on truncated Gaussian distribution is introduced to overcome the
continuity challenges in label shift correction. To embed the reweighted source
distribution to conditional invariant learning, we further derive a
probability-aware estimation of conditional operator discrepancy. Extensive
experiments on standard CDGE tasks with different backbone models validate the
superior generalization capability across domain and applicability on various
models of proposed method.

Abstract: Polarization images provide rich physical information that is fundamentally
absent from standard RGB images, benefiting a wide range of computer vision
applications such as reflection separation and material classification.
However, the acquisition of polarization images typically requires additional
optical components, which increases both the cost and the complexity of the
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task: RGB-to-polarization
image estimation, which aims to infer polarization information directly from
RGB images. In this work, we establish the first comprehensive benchmark for
this task by leveraging existing polarization datasets and evaluating a diverse
set of state-of-the-art deep learning models, including both
restoration-oriented and generative architectures. Through extensive
quantitative and qualitative analysis, our benchmark not only establishes the
current performance ceiling of RGB-to-polarization estimation, but also
systematically reveals the respective strengths and limitations of different
model families -- such as direct reconstruction versus generative synthesis,
and task-specific training versus large-scale pre-training. In addition, we
provide some potential directions for future research on polarization
estimation. This benchmark is intended to serve as a foundational resource to
facilitate the design and evaluation of future methods for polarization
estimation from standard RGB inputs.

Abstract: 3D visual illusion is a perceptual phenomenon where a two-dimensional plane
is manipulated to simulate three-dimensional spatial relationships, making a
flat artwork or object look three-dimensional in the human visual system. In
this paper, we reveal that the machine visual system is also seriously fooled
by 3D visual illusions, including monocular and binocular depth estimation. In
order to explore and analyze the impact of 3D visual illusion on depth
estimation, we collect a large dataset containing almost 3k scenes and 200k
images to train and evaluate SOTA monocular and binocular depth estimation
methods. We also propose a robust depth estimation framework that uses common
sense from a vision-language model to adaptively select reliable depth from
binocular disparity and monocular depth. Experiments show that SOTA monocular,
binocular, and multi-view depth estimation approaches are all fooled by various
3D visual illusions, while our method achieves SOTA performance.

Motivation: 现有方法常忽略RGB图像的辐射信息，导致在几何数据不足的区域配准效果不佳。CoFF旨在通过融合多模态信息解决这一问题。

Method: CoFF采用两阶段融合策略，结合3D点云特征和2D图像特征，并通过粗到精匹配模块建立准确对应关系。

Conclusion: CoFF通过跨模态特征融合显著提升了点云配准效果，尤其在几何模糊区域表现突出。

Abstract: Point cloud registration has seen significant advancements with the
application of deep learning techniques. However, existing approaches often
overlook the potential of integrating radiometric information from RGB images.
This limitation reduces their effectiveness in aligning point clouds pairs,
especially in regions where geometric data alone is insufficient. When used
effectively, radiometric information can enhance the registration process by
providing context that is missing from purely geometric data. In this paper, we
propose CoFF, a novel Cross-modal Feature Fusion method that utilizes both
point cloud geometry and RGB images for pairwise point cloud registration.
Assuming that the co-registration between point clouds and RGB images is
available, CoFF explicitly addresses the challenges where geometric information
alone is unclear, such as in regions with symmetric similarity or planar
structures, through a two-stage fusion of 3D point cloud features and 2D image
features. It incorporates a cross-modal feature fusion module that assigns
pixel-wise image features to 3D input point clouds to enhance learned 3D point
features, and integrates patch-wise image features with superpoint features to
improve the quality of coarse matching. This is followed by a coarse-to-fine
matching module that accurately establishes correspondences using the fused
features. We extensively evaluate CoFF on four common datasets: 3DMatch,
3DLoMatch, IndoorLRS, and the recently released ScanNet++ datasets. In
addition, we assess CoFF on specific subset datasets containing geometrically
ambiguous cases. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoFF achieves
state-of-the-art registration performance across all benchmarks, including
remarkable registration recalls of 95.9% and 81.6% on the widely-used 3DMatch
and 3DLoMatch datasets, respectively...(Truncated to fit arXiv abstract length)

Abstract: With the rapid rise of large models, copyright protection for generated image
content has become a critical security challenge. Although deep learning
watermarking techniques offer an effective solution for digital image copyright
protection, they still face limitations in terms of visual quality, robustness
and generalization. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive
robust iterative watermarking framework (ARIW-Framework) that achieves
high-quality watermarked images while maintaining exceptional robustness and
generalization performance. Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach to
optimize the encoder for generating robust residuals. The encoder incorporates
noise layers and a decoder to compute robustness weights for residuals under
various noise attacks. By employing a parallel optimization strategy, the
framework enhances robustness against multiple types of noise attacks.
Furthermore, we leverage image gradients to determine the embedding strength at
each pixel location, significantly improving the visual quality of the
watermarked images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior visual quality while exhibiting remarkable robustness and
generalization against noise attacks.

Motivation: RGB特征在视频异常检测中区分能力有限，尤其是在复杂现实场景中，因此需要引入多模态信息以提高检测的可靠性。

Method: PI-VAD通过五种模态增强RGB特征，包括伪模态生成模块和跨模态诱导模块，训练时使用五种模态骨干网络，推理时仅需RGB输入。

Result: 在三个主流视频异常检测数据集上实现了最先进的准确率。

Conclusion: 多模态增强显著提升了视频异常检测的鲁棒性，且推理时无需额外计算负担。

Abstract: Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are
conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to
limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that
RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such
as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex
real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by
additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced
framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations
by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity
to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity
representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion
(optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an
axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two
plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal
Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation
and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules
operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five
modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing
real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five
modality backbones at inference.

including restoration models for single degradation and restoration models for
multiple degradations. However, these solutions are not suitable for real-time

solution for video surveillance. To achieve this, using transfer learning with
ResNet_50, we developed a model for automatically identifying the types of
degradation present in an image to reference the necessary treatment(s) for

varied road and bridge structures, enabling detailed structural and functional

Frequency-Driven Change Detector (MFDCD), which integrates multimodal features
in the frequency domain. MFDCD includes a Dynamic Frequency Coupler (DFC) that
fuses hierarchical visual features with wavelet-based frequency components, and
a Textual Frequency Filter (TFF) that transforms CLIP-derived textual features
into the frequency domain and applies graph-based filtering. Experimental
results on RB-SCD and three public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of

Abstract: Recent advancements in dynamic 3D scene reconstruction have shown promising
results, enabling high-fidelity 3D novel view synthesis with improved temporal
consistency. Among these, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has emerged as an
appealing approach due to its ability to model high-fidelity spatial and
temporal variations. However, existing methods suffer from substantial
computational and memory overhead due to the redundant allocation of 4D
Gaussians to static regions, which can also degrade image quality. In this
work, we introduce hybrid 3D-4D Gaussian Splatting (3D-4DGS), a novel framework
that adaptively represents static regions with 3D Gaussians while reserving 4D
Gaussians for dynamic elements. Our method begins with a fully 4D Gaussian
representation and iteratively converts temporally invariant Gaussians into 3D,
significantly reducing the number of parameters and improving computational
efficiency. Meanwhile, dynamic Gaussians retain their full 4D representation,
capturing complex motions with high fidelity. Our approach achieves
significantly faster training times compared to baseline 4D Gaussian Splatting
methods while maintaining or improving the visual quality.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Automatic Complementary Separation Pruning (ACSP),
a novel and fully automated pruning method for convolutional neural networks.
ACSP integrates the strengths of both structured pruning and activation-based
pruning, enabling the efficient removal of entire components such as neurons
and channels while leveraging activations to identify and retain the most
relevant components. Our approach is designed specifically for supervised
learning tasks, where we construct a graph space that encodes the separation
capabilities of each component with respect to all class pairs. By employing
complementary selection principles and utilizing a clustering algorithm, ACSP
ensures that the selected components maintain diverse and complementary
separation capabilities, reducing redundancy and maintaining high network
performance. The method automatically determines the optimal subset of
components in each layer, utilizing a knee-finding algorithm to select the
minimal subset that preserves performance without requiring user-defined
pruning volumes. Extensive experiments on multiple architectures, including
VGG-16, ResNet-50, and MobileNet-V2, across datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet-1K, demonstrate that ACSP achieves competitive accuracy compared
to other methods while significantly reducing computational costs. This fully
automated approach not only enhances scalability but also makes ACSP especially

Conclusion: EventDC为事件驱动的深度补全提供了首个基准，展示了在动态场景中的优越性。

Abstract: Depth completion in dynamic scenes poses significant challenges due to rapid
ego-motion and object motion, which can severely degrade the quality of input
modalities such as RGB images and LiDAR measurements. Conventional RGB-D
sensors often struggle to align precisely and capture reliable depth under such
conditions. In contrast, event cameras with their high temporal resolution and
sensitivity to motion at the pixel level provide complementary cues that are
%particularly beneficial in dynamic environments.To this end, we propose
EventDC, the first event-driven depth completion framework. It consists of two
key components: Event-Modulated Alignment (EMA) and Local Depth Filtering
(LDF). Both modules adaptively learn the two fundamental components of
convolution operations: offsets and weights conditioned on motion-sensitive
event streams. In the encoder, EMA leverages events to modulate the sampling
positions of RGB-D features to achieve pixel redistribution for improved
alignment and fusion. In the decoder, LDF refines depth estimations around
moving objects by learning motion-aware masks from events. Additionally,
EventDC incorporates two loss terms to further benefit global alignment and
enhance local depth recovery. Moreover, we establish the first benchmark for
event-based depth completion comprising one real-world and two synthetic
datasets to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments on this benchmark
demonstrate the superiority of our EventDC.

datasets for underwater applications, which hinders the integration of
event-based vision with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). To address this,
synthetic datasets could provide a scalable solution while bridging the gap

synthetic event-based optical flow dataset based on the Stonefish simulator.
Along with the dataset, we present a data generation pipeline that enables the
creation of customizable underwater environments. This pipeline allows for
simulating dynamic scenarios, such as biologically inspired schools of fish
exhibiting realistic motion patterns, including obstacle avoidance and reactive
navigation around corals. Additionally, we introduce a scene generator that can

Abstract: Broader access to high-quality movement analysis could greatly benefit
movement science and rehabilitation, such as allowing more detailed

While emerging technologies are making it easier to capture kinematics with
biomechanical models, or how joint angles change over time, inferring the
underlying physics that give rise to these movements, including ground reaction
forces, joint torques, or even muscle activations, is still challenging. Here
we explore whether imitation learning applied to a biomechanical model from a

estimation has seen great interest in recent years, our work differences in
several ways: we focus on using an accurate biomechanical model instead of
models adopted for computer vision, we test it on a dataset that contains
participants with impaired movements, we reported detailed tracking metrics
relevant for the clinical measurement of movement including joint angles and
ground contact events, and finally we apply imitation learning to a
muscle-driven neuromusculoskeletal model. We show that our imitation learning
policy, KinTwin, can accurately replicate the kinematics of a wide range of
movements, including those with assistive devices or therapist assistance, and
that it can infer clinically meaningful differences in joint torques and muscle
activations. Our work demonstrates the potential for using imitation learning
to enable high-quality movement analysis in clinical practice.

Motivation: 现有视图合成和重建模型依赖校准相机或几何先验，限制了其在大规模未校准数据上的应用。本文旨在通过自监督训练解决这一问题。

Method: 两阶段策略：第一阶段通过隐式场景重建学习潜在相机和场景特征；第二阶段通过显式3D高斯基元预测和渲染损失优化3D一致性。

Conclusion: 两阶段策略互补且有效，为自监督视图合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Currently almost all state-of-the-art novel view synthesis and reconstruction
models rely on calibrated cameras or additional geometric priors for training.
These prerequisites significantly limit their applicability to massive
uncalibrated data. To alleviate this requirement and unlock the potential for
self-supervised training on large-scale uncalibrated videos, we propose a novel
two-stage strategy to train a view synthesis model from only raw video frames
or multi-view images, without providing camera parameters or other priors. In
the first stage, we learn to reconstruct the scene implicitly in a latent space
without relying on any explicit 3D representation. Specifically, we predict
per-frame latent camera and scene context features, and employ a view synthesis
model as a proxy for explicit rendering. This pretraining stage substantially
reduces the optimization complexity and encourages the network to learn the
underlying 3D consistency in a self-supervised manner. The learned latent
camera and implicit scene representation have a large gap compared with the
real 3D world. To reduce this gap, we introduce the second stage training by
explicitly predicting 3D Gaussian primitives. We additionally apply explicit
Gaussian Splatting rendering loss and depth projection loss to align the
learned latent representations with physically grounded 3D geometry. In this
way, Stage 1 provides a strong initialization and Stage 2 enforces 3D
consistency - the two stages are complementary and mutually beneficial.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
high-quality novel view synthesis and accurate camera pose estimation, compared
to methods that employ supervision with calibration, pose, or depth
information. The code is available at https://github.com/Dwawayu/Pensieve.

Abstract: Recent studies have made great progress in functional brain network
classification by modeling the brain as a network of Regions of Interest (ROIs)
and leveraging their connections to understand brain functionality and diagnose
mental disorders. Various deep learning architectures, including Convolutional
Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, and the recent Transformer, have been
developed. However, despite the increasing complexity of these models, the
performance gain has not been as salient. This raises a question: Does
increasing model complexity necessarily lead to higher classification accuracy?
In this paper, we revisit the simplest deep learning architecture, the
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and propose a pure MLP-based method, named
BrainNetMLP, for functional brain network classification, which capitalizes on
the advantages of MLP, including efficient computation and fewer parameters.
Moreover, BrainNetMLP incorporates a dual-branch structure to jointly capture
both spatial connectivity and spectral information, enabling precise
spatiotemporal feature fusion. We evaluate our proposed BrainNetMLP on two
public and popular brain network classification datasets, the Human Connectome
Project (HCP) and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Experimental
results demonstrate pure MLP-based methods can achieve state-of-the-art
performance, revealing the potential of MLP-based models as more efficient yet
effective alternatives in functional brain network classification. The code

Abstract: Radiotherapy often involves a prolonged treatment period. During this time,
patients may experience organ motion due to breathing and other physiological
factors. Predicting and modeling this motion before treatment is crucial for
ensuring precise radiation delivery. However, existing pre-treatment organ
motion prediction methods primarily rely on deformation analysis using
principal component analysis (PCA), which is highly dependent on registration
quality and struggles to capture periodic temporal dynamics for motion
modeling.In this paper, we observe that organ motion prediction closely
resembles an autoregressive process, a technique widely used in natural
language processing (NLP). Autoregressive models predict the next token based
on previous inputs, naturally aligning with our objective of predicting future
organ motion phases. Building on this insight, we reformulate organ motion
prediction as an autoregressive process to better capture patient-specific
motion patterns. Specifically, we acquire 4D CT scans for each patient before
treatment, with each sequence comprising multiple 3D CT phases. These phases
are fed into the autoregressive model to predict future phases based on prior
phase motion patterns. We evaluate our method on a real-world test set of 4D CT
scans from 50 patients who underwent radiotherapy at our institution and a
public dataset containing 4D CT scans from 20 patients (some with multiple
scans), totaling over 1,300 3D CT phases. The performance in predicting the
motion of the lung and heart surpasses existing benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing motion dynamics from CT images. These results
highlight the potential of our method to improve pre-treatment planning in
radiotherapy, enabling more precise and adaptive radiation delivery.

Abstract: Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos offers a
promising path toward generalizable and interpretable robotic
intelligence-particularly through the lens of actionable affordances. However,
transferring such knowledge remains challenging due to: 1) a lack of
large-scale datasets with precise affordance annotations, and 2) insufficient
exploration of affordances in diverse manipulation contexts. To address these
gaps, we introduce HOVA-500K, a large-scale, affordance-annotated dataset
comprising 500,000 images across 1,726 object categories and 675 actions. We
also release a standardized benchmarking suite for multi-modal affordance
reasoning. Built upon HOVA-500K, we present GLOVER++, a global-to-local
affordance training framework that effectively transfers actionable affordance
knowledge from human demonstrations to downstream open-vocabulary reasoning
tasks. GLOVER++ achieves state-of-the-art results on the HOVA-500K benchmark
and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse downstream robotic
manipulation tasks. By explicitly modeling actionable affordances, GLOVER++
facilitates robust transfer across scenes, modalities, and tasks. We hope that
HOVA-500K and the GLOVER++ framework will serve as valuable resources for
bridging the gap between human demonstrations and robotic manipulation
capabilities.

Abstract: This paper addresses the task of cross-modal medical image segmentation by
exploring unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches. We propose a
model-agnostic UDA framework, LowBridge, which builds on a simple observation
that cross-modal images share some similar low-level features (e.g., edges) as
they are depicting the same structures. Specifically, we first train a
generative model to recover the source images from their edge features,
followed by training a segmentation model on the generated source images,
separately. At test time, edge features from the target images are input to the
pretrained generative model to generate source-style target domain images,
which are then segmented using the pretrained segmentation network. Despite its
simplicity, extensive experiments on various publicly available datasets
demonstrate that \proposed achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
eleven existing UDA approaches under different settings. Notably, further
ablation studies show that \proposed is agnostic to different types of
generative and segmentation models, suggesting its potential to be seamlessly
plugged with the most advanced models to achieve even more outstanding results
in the future. The code is available at https://github.com/JoshuaLPF/LowBridge.

Abstract: Dynamic imaging is critical for understanding and visualizing dynamic
biological processes in medicine and cell biology. These applications often
encounter the challenge of a limited amount of time series data and time
points, which hinders learning meaningful patterns. Regularization methods
provide valuable prior knowledge to address this challenge, enabling the
extraction of relevant information despite the scarcity of time-series data and
time points. In particular, low-dimensionality assumptions on the image
manifold address sample scarcity, while time progression models, such as
optimal transport (OT), provide priors on image development to mitigate the
lack of time points. Existing approaches using low-dimensionality assumptions
disregard a temporal prior but leverage information from multiple time series.
OT-prior methods, however, incorporate the temporal prior but regularize only
individual time series, ignoring information from other time series of the same
image modality. In this work, we investigate the effect of integrating a
low-dimensionality assumption of the underlying image manifold with an OT
regularizer for time-evolving images. In particular, we propose a latent model
representation of the underlying image manifold and promote consistency between
this representation, the time series data, and the OT prior on the
time-evolving images. We discuss the advantages of enriching OT interpolations
with latent models and integrating OT priors into latent models.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides valuable insights in
ophthalmology, cardiology, and neurology due to high-resolution,
cross-sectional images of the retina. One critical task for ophthalmologists
using OCT is delineation of retinal layers within scans. This process is
time-consuming and prone to human bias, affecting the accuracy and reliability
of diagnoses. Previous efforts to automate delineation using deep learning face
challenges in uptake from clinicians and statisticians due to the absence of
uncertainty estimation, leading to "confidently wrong" models via
hallucinations. In this study, we address these challenges by applying Bayesian
convolutional neural networks (BCNNs) to segment an openly available OCT
imaging dataset containing 35 human retina OCTs split between healthy controls
and patients with multiple sclerosis. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian
models can be used to provide uncertainty maps of the segmentation, which can
further be used to identify highly uncertain samples that exhibit recording
artefacts such as noise or miscalibration at inference time. Our method also
allows for uncertainty-estimation for important secondary measurements such as
layer thicknesses, that are medically relevant for patients. We show that these
features come in addition to greater performance compared to similar work over
all delineations; with an overall Dice score of 95.65%. Our work brings greater
clinical applicability, statistical robustness, and performance to retinal OCT
segmentation.

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) images are often accompanied by significant noise, which
negatively impacts image quality and subsequent diagnostic accuracy. To address
the challenges of multi-scale feature fusion and diverse noise distribution
patterns in LDCT denoising, this paper introduces an innovative model,
CTLformer, which combines convolutional structures with transformer
architecture. Two key innovations are proposed: a multi-scale attention
mechanism and a dynamic attention control mechanism. The multi-scale attention
mechanism, implemented through the Token2Token mechanism and self-attention
interaction modules, effectively captures both fine details and global
structures at different scales, enhancing relevant features and suppressing
noise. The dynamic attention control mechanism adapts the attention
distribution based on the noise characteristics of the input image, focusing on
high-noise regions while preserving details in low-noise areas, thereby
enhancing robustness and improving denoising performance. Furthermore,
CTLformer integrates convolutional layers for efficient feature extraction and
uses overlapping inference to mitigate boundary artifacts, further
strengthening its denoising capability. Experimental results on the 2016
National Institutes of Health AAPM Mayo Clinic LDCT Challenge dataset
demonstrate that CTLformer significantly outperforms existing methods in both
denoising performance and model efficiency, greatly improving the quality of
LDCT images. The proposed CTLformer not only provides an efficient solution for
LDCT denoising but also shows broad potential in medical image analysis,
especially for clinical applications dealing with complex noise patterns.

Abstract: Prostate cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers among men,
making its early detection critically important. Although ultrasound imaging
offers greater accessibility and cost-effectiveness compared to MRI,
traditional transrectal ultrasound methods suffer from low sensitivity,
especially in detecting anteriorly located tumors. Ultrasound computed
tomography provides quantitative tissue characterization, but its clinical
implementation faces significant challenges, particularly under anatomically
constrained limited-angle acquisition conditions specific to prostate imaging.
To address these unmet needs, we introduce OpenPros, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset explicitly developed for limited-view prostate USCT. Our
dataset includes over 280,000 paired samples of realistic 2D speed-of-sound
(SOS) phantoms and corresponding ultrasound full-waveform data, generated from
anatomically accurate 3D digital prostate models derived from real clinical
MRI/CT scans and ex vivo ultrasound measurements, annotated by medical experts.
Simulations are conducted under clinically realistic configurations using
advanced finite-difference time-domain and Runge-Kutta acoustic wave solvers,
both provided as open-source components. Through comprehensive baseline
experiments, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art deep learning methods surpass
traditional physics-based approaches in both inference efficiency and
reconstruction accuracy. Nevertheless, current deep learning models still fall
short of delivering clinically acceptable high-resolution images with
sufficient accuracy. By publicly releasing OpenPros, we aim to encourage the
development of advanced machine learning algorithms capable of bridging this
performance gap and producing clinically usable, high-resolution, and highly
accurate prostate ultrasound images. The dataset is publicly accessible at

Abstract: Visual odometry (VO) is typically considered as a chicken-and-egg problem, as
the localization and mapping modules are tightly-coupled. The estimation of
visual map relies on accurate localization information. Meanwhile, localization
requires precise map points to provide motion constraints. This classical
design principle is naturally inherited by visual-inertial odometry (VIO).
Efficient localization solution that does not require a map has not been fully
investigated. To this end, we propose a novel structureless VIO, where the
visual map is removed from the odometry framework. Experimental results
demonstrated that, compared to the structure-based VIO baseline, our
structureless VIO not only substantially improves computational efficiency but
also has advantages in accuracy.

Abstract: Human aesthetic preferences for 3D shapes are central to industrial design,
virtual reality, and consumer product development. However, most computational
models of 3D aesthetics lack empirical grounding in large-scale human
judgments, limiting their practical relevance. We present a large-scale study
of human preferences. We collected 22,301 pairwise comparisons across five
object categories (chairs, tables, mugs, lamps, and dining chairs) via Amazon
Mechanical Turk. Building on a previously published
dataset~\cite{dev2020learning}, we introduce new non-linear modeling and
cross-category analysis to uncover the geometric drivers of aesthetic
preference. We apply the Bradley-Terry model to infer latent aesthetic scores
and use Random Forests with SHAP analysis to identify and interpret the most
influential geometric features (e.g., symmetry, curvature, compactness). Our
cross-category analysis reveals both universal principles and domain-specific
trends in aesthetic preferences. We focus on human interpretable geometric
features to ensure model transparency and actionable design insights, rather
than relying on black-box deep learning approaches. Our findings bridge
computational aesthetics and cognitive science, providing practical guidance
for designers and a publicly available dataset to support reproducibility. This
work advances the understanding of 3D shape aesthetics through a human-centric,

while also specializing to direct sampling algorithms in particular cases.
Finally, we present detailed numerical experiments that demonstrate the

Abstract: Ground texture localization using a downward-facing camera offers a low-cost,

achieving substantially higher accuracy for global localization and higher
precision and recall for loop closure detection in SLAM. Our approach leverages
an approximate $k$-means (AKM) vocabulary with soft assignment, and exploits
the consistent orientation and constant scale constraints inherent to ground
texture localization. Identifying the different needs of global localization
vs. loop closure detection for SLAM, we present both high-accuracy and
high-speed versions of our algorithm. We test the effect of each of our
proposed improvements through an ablation study and demonstrate our method's
effectiveness for both global localization and loop closure detection. With
numerous ground texture localization systems already using BoW, our method can
readily replace other generic BoW systems in their pipeline and immediately

Abstract: For the elderly population, falls pose a serious and increasing risk of
serious injury and loss of independence. In order to overcome this difficulty,
we present ElderFallGuard: A Computer Vision Based IoT Solution for Elderly
Fall Detection and Notification, a cutting-edge, non-invasive system intended
for quick caregiver alerts and real-time fall detection. Our approach leverages
the power of computer vision, utilizing MediaPipe for accurate human pose
estimation from standard video streams. We developed a custom dataset
comprising 7200 samples across 12 distinct human poses to train and evaluate
various machine learning classifiers, with Random Forest ultimately selected
for its superior performance. ElderFallGuard employs a specific detection
logic, identifying a fall when a designated prone pose ("Pose6") is held for
over 3 seconds coupled with a significant drop in motion detected for more than
2 seconds. Upon confirmation, the system instantly dispatches an alert,
including a snapshot of the event, to a designated Telegram group via a custom
bot, incorporating cooldown logic to prevent notification overload. Rigorous
testing on our dataset demonstrated exceptional results, achieving 100%
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. ElderFallGuard offers a promising,
vision-based IoT solution to enhance elderly safety and provide peace of mind
for caregivers through intelligent, timely alerts.

Abstract: Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis has become increasingly prominent in
cancer survival prediction. However, existing studies mainly utilize
multi-instance learning to aggregate patch-level features, neglecting the
information loss of contextual and hierarchical details within pathology
images. Furthermore, the disparity in data granularity and dimensionality
between pathology and genomics leads to a significant modality imbalance. The
high spatial resolution inherent in pathology data renders it a dominant role
while overshadowing genomics in multimodal integration. In this paper, we
propose a multimodal survival prediction framework that incorporates hypergraph
learning to effectively capture both contextual and hierarchical details from
pathology images. Moreover, it employs a modality rebalance mechanism and an
interactive alignment fusion strategy to dynamically reweight the contributions
of the two modalities, thereby mitigating the pathology-genomics imbalance.
Quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on five TCGA datasets,
demonstrating that our model outperforms advanced methods by over 3.4\% in
C-Index performance.

Abstract: Accurate and fine-grained crop yield prediction plays a crucial role in
advancing global agriculture. However, the accuracy of pixel-level yield
estimation based on satellite remote sensing data has been constrained by the
scarcity of ground truth data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
approach called the Multi-Task Crop Yield Prediction Network (MT-CYP-Net). This
framework introduces an effective multi-task feature-sharing strategy, where
features extracted from a shared backbone network are simultaneously utilized
by both crop yield prediction decoders and crop classification decoders with
the ability to fuse information between them. This design allows MT-CYP-Net to
be trained with extremely sparse crop yield point labels and crop type labels,
while still generating detailed pixel-level crop yield maps. Concretely, we
collected 1,859 yield point labels along with corresponding crop type labels
and satellite images from eight farms in Heilongjiang Province, China, in 2023,
covering soybean, maize, and rice crops, and constructed a sparse crop yield
label dataset. MT-CYP-Net is compared with three classical machine learning and
deep learning benchmark methods in this dataset. Experimental results not only
indicate the superiority of MT-CYP-Net compared to previous methods on multiple
types of crops but also demonstrate the potential of deep networks on precise
pixel-level crop yield prediction, especially with limited data labels.

Result: 实验表明，DIMM将现有状态估计方法的跟踪准确性提高了31.61%~99.23%。

Conclusion: DIMM通过创新设计解决了传统IMM的局限性，显著提升了3D物体跟踪性能。

Abstract: State estimation is challenging for 3D object tracking with high
maneuverability, as the target's state transition function changes rapidly,
irregularly, and is unknown to the estimator. Existing work based on
interacting multiple model (IMM) achieves more accurate estimation than
single-filter approaches through model combination, aligning appropriate models
for different motion modes of the target object over time. However, two
limitations of conventional IMM remain unsolved. First, the solution space of
the model combination is constrained as the target's diverse kinematic
properties in different directions are ignored. Second, the model combination
weights calculated by the observation likelihood are not accurate enough due to
the measurement uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, DIMM,
to effectively combine estimates from different motion models in each
direction, thus increasing the 3D object tracking accuracy. First, DIMM extends
the model combination solution space of conventional IMM from a hyperplane to a
hypercube by designing a 3D-decoupled multi-hierarchy filter bank, which
describes the target's motion with various-order linear models. Second, DIMM
generates more reliable combination weight matrices through a differentiable
adaptive fusion network for importance allocation rather than solely relying on
the observation likelihood; it contains an attention-based twin delayed deep
deterministic policy gradient (TD3) method with a hierarchical reward.
Experiments demonstrate that DIMM significantly improves the tracking accuracy
of existing state estimation methods by 31.61%~99.23%.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enable operations in remote and hazardous
environments, yet the visible-spectrum, camera-based navigation systems often
relied upon by UAVs struggle in low-visibility conditions. Thermal cameras,
which capture long-wave infrared radiation, are able to function effectively in
darkness and smoke, where visible-light cameras fail. This work explores
learned cross-spectral (thermal-visible) point features as a means to integrate
thermal imagery into established camera-based navigation systems. Existing
methods typically train a feature network's detection and description outputs
directly, which often focuses training on image regions where thermal and
visible-spectrum images exhibit similar appearance. Aiming to more fully
utilize the available data, we propose a method to train the feature network on
the tasks of matching and registration. We run our feature network on
thermal-visible image pairs, then feed the network response into a
differentiable registration pipeline. Losses are applied to the matching and
registration estimates of this pipeline. Our selected model, trained on the
task of matching, achieves a registration error (corner error) below 10 pixels
for more than 75% of estimates on the MultiPoint dataset. We further
demonstrate that our model can also be used with a classical pipeline for
matching and registration.

Conclusion: IA-MVS方法显著提升了深度估计精度，且无需额外训练负担。

Abstract: Multi-view stereo (MVS) models based on progressive depth hypothesis
narrowing have made remarkable advancements. However, existing methods haven't
fully utilized the potential that the depth coverage of individual instances is
smaller than that of the entire scene, which restricts further improvements in
depth estimation precision. Moreover, inevitable deviations in the initial
stage accumulate as the process advances. In this paper, we propose
Instance-Adaptive MVS (IA-MVS). It enhances the precision of depth estimation
by narrowing the depth hypothesis range and conducting refinement on each
instance. Additionally, a filtering mechanism based on intra-instance depth
continuity priors is incorporated to boost robustness. Furthermore, recognizing
that existing confidence estimation can degrade IA-MVS performance on point
clouds. We have developed a detailed mathematical model for confidence
estimation based on conditional probability. The proposed method can be widely
applied in models based on MVSNet without imposing extra training burdens. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU benchmark. The source

Conclusion: 该模型在LiDAR多目标跟踪中优于基线方法和SOTA模型，尤其在复杂场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking from LiDAR point clouds presents unique challenges due
to the sparse and irregular nature of the data, compounded by the need for
temporal coherence across frames. Traditional tracking systems often rely on
hand-crafted features and motion models, which can struggle to maintain
consistent object identities in crowded or fast-moving scenes. We present a
lidar-based two-staged DETR inspired transformer; a smoother and tracker. The
smoother stage refines lidar object detections, from any off-the-shelf
detector, across a moving temporal window. The tracker stage uses a DETR-based
attention block to maintain tracks across time by associating tracked objects
with the refined detections using the point cloud as context. The model is
trained on the datasets nuScenes and KITTI in both online and offline (forward
peeking) modes demonstrating strong performance across metrics such as
ID-switch and multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA). The numerical results
indicate that the online mode outperforms the lidar-only baseline and SOTA
models on the nuScenes dataset, with an aMOTA of 0.722 and an aMOTP of 0.475,
while the offline mode provides an additional 3 pp aMOTP

Conclusion: 联合估计方法在动态场景中更高效有效。

Abstract: Single-Photon Light Detection and Ranging (SP-LiDAR is emerging as a leading
technology for long-range, high-precision 3D vision tasks. In SP-LiDAR,
timestamps encode two complementary pieces of information: pulse travel time
(depth) and the number of photons reflected by the object (reflectivity).
Existing SP-LiDAR reconstruction methods typically recover depth and
reflectivity separately or sequentially use one modality to estimate the other.
Moreover, the conventional 3D histogram construction is effective mainly for
slow-moving or stationary scenes. In dynamic scenes, however, it is more
efficient and effective to directly process the timestamps. In this paper, we
introduce an estimation method to simultaneously recover both depth and
reflectivity in fast-moving scenes. We offer two contributions: (1) A
theoretical analysis demonstrating the mutual correlation between depth and
reflectivity and the conditions under which joint estimation becomes
beneficial. (2) A novel reconstruction method, "SPLiDER", which exploits the
shared information to enhance signal recovery. On both synthetic and real
SP-LiDAR data, our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior
joint reconstruction quality.

Abstract: 3D Lane detection plays an important role in autonomous driving. Recent
advances primarily build Birds-Eye-View (BEV) feature from front-view (FV)
images to perceive 3D information of Lane more effectively. However,
constructing accurate BEV information from FV image is limited due to the
lacking of depth information, causing previous works often rely heavily on the
assumption of a flat ground plane. Leveraging monocular depth estimation to
assist in constructing BEV features is less constrained, but existing methods
struggle to effectively integrate the two tasks. To address the above issue, in
this paper, an accurate 3D lane detection method based on depth-aware BEV
feature transtormation is proposed. In detail, an effective feature extraction
module is designed, in which a Depth Net is integrated to obtain the vital
depth information for 3D perception, thereby simplifying the complexity of view
transformation. Subquently a feature reduce module is proposed to reduce height
dimension of FV features and depth features, thereby enables effective fusion
of crucial FV features and depth features. Then a fusion module is designed to
build BEV feature from prime FV feature and depth information. The proposed
method performs comparably with state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic
Apollo, realistic OpenLane datasets.

Abstract: We propose a unified deep meta-learning framework for accelerated magnetic

cross-modality synthesis. Motivated by the limitations of conventional methods
in handling undersampled data and missing modalities, our approach unrolls a
provably convergent optimization algorithm into a structured neural network
architecture. Each phase of the network mimics a step of an adaptive
forward-backward scheme with extrapolation, enabling the model to incorporate
both data fidelity and nonconvex regularization in a principled manner. To
enhance generalization across different acquisition settings, we integrate
meta-learning, which enables the model to rapidly adapt to unseen sampling
patterns and modality combinations using task-specific meta-knowledge. The
proposed method is evaluated on the open source datasets, showing significant
improvements in PSNR and SSIM over conventional supervised learning, especially

Conclusion: 比率损失函数有效解决了传统方法在dMRI超分辨率中的局限性，提升了扩散指标的准确性。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is essential for studying brain microstructure, but
high-resolution imaging remains challenging due to the inherent trade-offs
between acquisition time and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Conventional methods
often optimize only the diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) without considering
their relationship with the non-diffusion-weighted (b=0) reference images.
However, calculating diffusion metrics, such as the apparent diffusion
coefficient (ADC) and diffusion tensor with its derived metrics like fractional
anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), relies on the ratio between each DWI
and the b=0 image, which is crucial for clinical observation and diagnostics.
In this study, we demonstrate that solely enhancing DWIs using a conventional
pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss is insufficient, as the error in ratio
between generated DWIs and b=0 diverges. We propose a novel ratio loss, defined
as the MSE loss between the predicted and ground-truth log of DWI/b=0 ratios.
Our results show that incorporating the ratio loss significantly improves the
convergence of this ratio error, achieving lower ratio MSE and slightly
enhancing the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of generated DWIs. This leads
to improved dMRI super-resolution and better preservation of b=0 ratio-based
features for the derivation of diffusion metrics.

Abstract: Accurately registering breast MR images from different time points enables
the alignment of anatomical structures and tracking of tumor progression,
supporting more effective breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment
planning. However, the complexity of dense tissue and its highly non-rigid
nature pose challenges for conventional registration methods, which primarily
focus on aligning general structures while overlooking intricate internal
details. To address this, we propose \textbf{GuidedMorph}, a novel two-stage
registration framework designed to better align dense tissue. In addition to a
single-scale network for global structure alignment, we introduce a framework
that utilizes dense tissue information to track breast movement. The learned
transformation fields are fused by introducing the Dual Spatial Transformer
Network (DSTN), improving overall alignment accuracy. A novel warping method
based on the Euclidean distance transform (EDT) is also proposed to accurately
warp the registered dense tissue and breast masks, preserving fine structural
details during deformation. The framework supports paradigms that require
external segmentation models and with image data only. It also operates
effectively with the VoxelMorph and TransMorph backbones, offering a versatile
solution for breast registration. We validate our method on ISPY2 and internal
dataset, demonstrating superior performance in dense tissue, overall breast
alignment, and breast structural similarity index measure (SSIM), with notable
improvements by over 13.01% in dense tissue Dice, 3.13% in breast Dice, and
1.21% in breast SSIM compared to the best learning-based baseline.

Abstract: Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) constitute the foundational
blueprint of a plant, depicting the interconnections among process equipment,
instrumentation for process control, and the flow of fluids and control
signals. In their existing setup, the manual mapping of information from P&ID
sheets holds a significant challenge. This is a time-consuming process, taking
around 3-6 months, and is susceptible to errors. It also depends on the
expertise of the domain experts and often requires multiple rounds of review.
The digitization of P&IDs entails merging detected line segments, which is
essential for linking various detected instruments, thereby creating a
comprehensive digitized P&ID. This paper focuses on explaining how line
segments which are detected using a computer vision model are merged and
eventually building the connection between equipment and merged lines. Hence
presenting a digitized form of information stating the interconnection between
process equipment, instrumentation, flow of fluids and control signals.
Eventually, which can be stored in a knowledge graph and that information along
with the help of advanced algorithms can be leveraged for tasks like finding
optimal routes, detecting system cycles, computing transitive closures, and
more.

Conclusion: DPCD数据库推动了DPCQA研究，并公开可用。

Abstract: Recently, the advancements in Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR) have driven
the demand for Dynamic Point Clouds (DPC). Unlike static point clouds, DPCs are
capable of capturing temporal changes within objects or scenes, offering a more
accurate simulation of the real world. While significant progress has been made
in the quality assessment research of static point cloud, little study has been
done on Dynamic Point Cloud Quality Assessment (DPCQA), which hinders the
development of quality-oriented applications, such as interframe compression
and transmission in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a
large-scale DPCQA database, named DPCD, which includes 15 reference DPCs and
525 distorted DPCs from seven types of lossy compression and noise distortion.
By rendering these samples to Processed Video Sequences (PVS), a comprehensive
subjective experiment is conducted to obtain Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) from 21
viewers for analysis. The characteristic of contents, impact of various
distortions, and accuracy of MOSs are presented to validate the heterogeneity
and reliability of the proposed database. Furthermore, we evaluate the
performance of several objective metrics on DPCD. The experiment results show
that DPCQA is more challenge than that of static point cloud. The DPCD, which
serves as a catalyst for new research endeavors on DPCQA, is publicly available

Abstract: Global tree species mapping using remote sensing data is vital for

million geolocated tree occurrences, spanning 275 families, 2,734 genera, and
21,001 species across the hierarchical taxonomic levels. Each sample is paired
with Sentinel-2 image time series and 27 auxiliary environmental variables,
encompassing bioclimatic, geographic, and soil data. The dataset is partitioned
into GlobalGeoTree-6M for model pretraining and curated evaluation subsets,
primarily GlobalGeoTree-10kEval for zero-shot and few-shot benchmarking. To
demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we introduce a baseline model,
GeoTreeCLIP, which leverages paired remote sensing data and taxonomic text
labels within a vision-language framework pretrained on GlobalGeoTree-6M.
Experimental results show that GeoTreeCLIP achieves substantial improvements in
zero- and few-shot classification on GlobalGeoTree-10kEval over existing
advanced models. By making the dataset, models, and code publicly available, we
aim to establish a benchmark to advance tree species classification and foster
innovation in biodiversity research and ecological applications.

Abstract: We present VGGT-SLAM, a dense RGB SLAM system constructed by incrementally
and globally aligning submaps created from the feed-forward scene
reconstruction approach VGGT using only uncalibrated monocular cameras. While
related works align submaps using similarity transforms (i.e., translation,
rotation, and scale), we show that such approaches are inadequate in the case
of uncalibrated cameras. In particular, we revisit the idea of reconstruction
ambiguity, where given a set of uncalibrated cameras with no assumption on the
camera motion or scene structure, the scene can only be reconstructed up to a
15-degrees-of-freedom projective transformation of the true geometry. This
inspires us to recover a consistent scene reconstruction across submaps by
optimizing over the SL(4) manifold, thus estimating 15-degrees-of-freedom
homography transforms between sequential submaps while accounting for potential
loop closure constraints. As verified by extensive experiments, we demonstrate
that VGGT-SLAM achieves improved map quality using long video sequences that
are infeasible for VGGT due to its high GPU requirements.

Abstract: Jitter degrades a spacecraft's fine-pointing ability required for optical
communication, earth observation, and space domain awareness. Development of
jitter estimation and compensation algorithms requires high-fidelity sensor
observations representative of on-board jitter. In this work, we present the
Event-based Star Tracking Under Jitter (e-STURT) dataset -- the first event
camera based dataset of star observations under controlled jitter conditions.
Specialized hardware employed for the dataset emulates an event-camera
undergoing on-board jitter. While the event camera provides asynchronous, high
temporal resolution star observations, systematic and repeatable jitter is
introduced using a micrometer accurate piezoelectric actuator. Various jitter
sources are simulated using distinct frequency bands and utilizing both axes of
motion. Ground-truth jitter is captured in hardware from the piezoelectric
actuator. The resulting dataset consists of 200 sequences and is made publicly
available. This work highlights the dataset generation process, technical
challenges and the resulting limitations. To serve as a baseline, we propose a
high-frequency jitter estimation algorithm that operates directly on the event
stream. The e-STURT dataset will enable the development of jitter aware
algorithms for mission critical event-based space sensing applications.

Abstract: Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is an emerging modality for
non-invasive brain stimulation and therapeutic intervention, offering
millimeter-scale spatial precision and the ability to target deep brain
structures. However, the heterogeneous and anisotropic nature of the human
skull introduces significant distortions to the propagating ultrasound
wavefront, which require time-consuming patient-specific planning and
corrections using numerical solvers for accurate targeting. To enable
data-driven approaches in this domain, we introduce TFUScapes, the first
large-scale, high-resolution dataset of tFUS simulations through anatomically
realistic human skulls derived from T1-weighted MRI images. We have developed a
scalable simulation engine pipeline using the k-Wave pseudo-spectral solver,
where each simulation returns a steady-state pressure field generated by a
focused ultrasound transducer placed at realistic scalp locations. In addition
to the dataset, we present DeepTFUS, a deep learning model that estimates
normalized pressure fields directly from input 3D CT volumes and transducer
position. The model extends a U-Net backbone with transducer-aware
conditioning, incorporating Fourier-encoded position embeddings and MLP layers
to create global transducer embeddings. These embeddings are fused with U-Net
encoder features via feature-wise modulation, dynamic convolutions, and
cross-attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of
spatially weighted and gradient-sensitive loss functions, enabling it to
approximate high-fidelity wavefields. The TFUScapes dataset is publicly
released to accelerate research at the intersection of computational acoustics,
neurotechnology, and deep learning. The project page is available at

Abstract: As large language models become integral to high-stakes applications,
ensuring their robustness and fairness is critical. Despite their success,
large language models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small
perturbations, such as synonym substitutions, can alter model predictions,
posing risks in fairness-critical areas, such as gender bias mitigation, and
safety-critical areas, such as toxicity detection. While formal verification
has been explored for neural networks, its application to large language models
remains limited. This work presents a holistic verification framework to
certify the robustness of transformer-based language models, with a focus on
ensuring gender fairness and consistent outputs across different gender-related
terms. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to toxicity detection, offering
formal guarantees that adversarially manipulated toxic inputs are consistently
detected and appropriately censored, thereby ensuring the reliability of
moderation systems. By formalizing robustness within the embedding space, this
work strengthens the reliability of language models in ethical AI deployment

Abstract: RLHF has emerged as a predominant approach for aligning artificial
intelligence systems with human preferences, demonstrating exceptional and
measurable efficacy in instruction following tasks; however, it exhibits
insufficient compliance capabilities when confronted with complex
multi-instruction tasks. Conventional approaches rely heavily on human
annotation or more sophisticated large language models, thereby introducing
substantial resource expenditure or potential bias concerns. Meanwhile,
alternative synthetic methods that augment standard preference datasets often
compromise the model's semantic quality. Our research identifies a critical
oversight in existing techniques, which predominantly focus on comparing
responses while neglecting valuable latent signals embedded within prompt
inputs, and which only focus on preference disparities at the intra-sample
level, while neglecting to account for the inter-sample level preference
differentials that exist among preference data. To leverage these previously
neglected indicators, we propose a novel Multi-level Aware Preference Learning
(MAPL) framework, capable of enhancing multi-instruction capabilities.
Specifically, for any given response in original preference data pairs, we
construct varied prompts with a preference relation under different conditions,
in order to learn intra-sample level preference disparities. Furthermore, for
any given original preference pair, we synthesize multi-instruction preference
pairs to capture preference discrepancies at the inter-sample level. Building
on the two datasets constructed above, we consequently devise two sophisticated
training objective functions. Subsequently, our framework integrates seamlessly
into both Reward Modeling and Direct Preference Optimization paradigms. Through
rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks, we empirically validate the
efficacy of our framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in complex reasoning, with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) being a key enhancement
strategy. However, a prevalent issue is ``superficial self-reflection'', where
models fail to robustly verify their own outputs. We introduce RISE
(Reinforcing Reasoning with Self-Verification), a novel online RL framework
designed to tackle this. RISE explicitly and simultaneously trains an LLM to
improve both its problem-solving and self-verification abilities within a
single, integrated RL process. The core mechanism involves leveraging
verifiable rewards from an outcome verifier to provide on-the-fly feedback for
both solution generation and self-verification tasks. In each iteration, the
model generates solutions, then critiques its own on-policy generated
solutions, with both trajectories contributing to the policy update. Extensive
experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that RISE
consistently improves model's problem-solving accuracy while concurrently
fostering strong self-verification skills. Our analyses highlight the
advantages of online verification and the benefits of increased verification
compute. Additionally, RISE models exhibit more frequent and accurate
self-verification behaviors during reasoning. These advantages reinforce RISE
as a flexible and effective path towards developing more robust and self-aware
reasoners.

Abstract: LLMs are being set loose in complex, real-world environments involving
sequential decision-making and tool use. Often, this involves making choices on
behalf of human users. However, not much is known about the distribution of
such choices, and how susceptible they are to different choice architectures.
We perform a case study with a few such LLM models on a multi-attribute tabular
decision-making problem, under canonical nudges such as the default option,
suggestions, and information highlighting, as well as additional prompting
strategies. We show that, despite superficial similarities to human choice
distributions, such models differ in subtle but important ways. First, they
show much higher susceptibility to the nudges. Second, they diverge in points
earned, being affected by factors like the idiosyncrasy of available prizes.
Third, they diverge in information acquisition strategies: e.g. incurring
substantial cost to reveal too much information, or selecting without revealing
any. Moreover, we show that simple prompt strategies like zero-shot chain of
thought (CoT) can shift the choice distribution, and few-shot prompting with
human data can induce greater alignment. Yet, none of these methods resolve the
sensitivity of these models to nudges. Finally, we show how optimal nudges
optimized with a human resource-rational model can similarly increase LLM
performance for some models. All these findings suggest that behavioral tests
are needed before deploying models as agents or assistants acting on behalf of
users in complex environments.

Abstract: Polysemanticity -- where individual neurons encode multiple unrelated
features -- is a well-known characteristic of large neural networks and remains
a central challenge in the interpretability of language models. At the same
time, its implications for model safety are also poorly understood. Leveraging
recent advances in sparse autoencoders, we investigate the polysemantic
structure of two small models (Pythia-70M and GPT-2-Small) and evaluate their
vulnerability to targeted, covert interventions at the prompt, feature, token,
and neuron levels. Our analysis reveals a consistent polysemantic topology
shared across both models. Strikingly, we demonstrate that this structure can
be exploited to mount effective interventions on two larger, black-box
instruction-tuned models (LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct). These
findings suggest not only the generalizability of the interventions but also
point to a stable and transferable polysemantic structure that could
potentially persist across architectures and training regimes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Dylan的新框架，将符号规划融入强化学习，通过动态调整奖励和利用人类先验知识，显著提升RL代理的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习代理（如PPO）缺乏人类先验知识，导致训练效率低下。研究旨在通过引入符号规划，使RL代理更高效地学习和适应任务。

Method: 提出Dylan框架，结合符号规划和强化学习，动态调整奖励并指导代理完成子任务。Dylan还能作为高级规划器，组合原始策略生成新行为。

Result: 实验表明，Dylan显著提升RL代理的性能，并增强其在未见任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Dylan通过整合符号规划和人类先验知识，为强化学习提供了更高效的训练和探索方法。

Abstract: When tackling complex problems, humans naturally break them down into
smaller, manageable subtasks and adjust their initial plans based on
observations. For instance, if you want to make coffee at a friend's place, you
might initially plan to grab coffee beans, go to the coffee machine, and pour
them into the machine. Upon noticing that the machine is full, you would skip
the initial steps and proceed directly to brewing. In stark contrast, state of
the art reinforcement learners, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO),
lack such prior knowledge and therefore require significantly more training
steps to exhibit comparable adaptive behavior. Thus, a central research
question arises: \textit{How can we enable reinforcement learning (RL) agents
to have similar ``human priors'', allowing the agent to learn with fewer
training interactions?} To address this challenge, we propose differentiable
symbolic planner (Dylan), a novel framework that integrates symbolic planning
into Reinforcement Learning. Dylan serves as a reward model that dynamically
shapes rewards by leveraging human priors, guiding agents through intermediate
subtasks, thus enabling more efficient exploration. Beyond reward shaping,
Dylan can work as a high level planner that composes primitive policies to
generate new behaviors while avoiding common symbolic planner pitfalls such as
infinite execution loops. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that Dylan
significantly improves RL agents' performance and facilitates generalization to
unseen tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多目标强化学习的推理LLM（REMOR），用于改进AI同行评审系统，生成更实质性的反馈。通过设计多方面的奖励函数，并训练两种模型（REMOR-H和REMOR-U），结果显示REMOR优于人类评审和其他AI基线。


<details>

Motivation: 解决现有AI同行评审系统反馈浅显和过度赞扬的问题，通过强化学习训练推理LLM以生成更高质量的评审。

Method: 1. 设计多方面的奖励函数（HPRR）；2. 使用PeerRT数据集对模型进行监督微调；3. 应用GRPO训练REMOR-H和REMOR-U模型。

Result: REMOR模型在奖励分数上超过人类评审和其他AI系统两倍以上，且避免了低质量评审的长尾问题。

Conclusion: 推理能力是提升评审质量的关键，同时发布了HPRR奖励函数、PeerRT数据集和REMOR模型以推动领域发展。

Abstract: AI-based peer review systems tend to produce shallow and overpraising
suggestions compared to human feedback. Here, we evaluate how well a reasoning
LLM trained with multi-objective reinforcement learning (REMOR) can overcome
these limitations. We start by designing a multi-aspect reward function that
aligns with human evaluation of reviews. The aspects are related to the review
itself (e.g., criticisms, novelty) and the relationship between the review and
the manuscript (i.e., relevance). First, we perform supervised fine-tuning of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B using LoRA on PeerRT, a new dataset of high-quality
top AI conference reviews enriched with reasoning traces. We then apply Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train two models: REMOR-H (with the
human-aligned reward) and REMOR-U (with a uniform reward). Interestingly, the
human-aligned reward penalizes aspects typically associated with strong
reviews, leading REMOR-U to produce qualitatively more substantive feedback.
Our results show that REMOR-U and REMOR-H achieve more than twice the average
rewards of human reviews, non-reasoning state-of-the-art agentic multi-modal AI
review systems, and general commercial LLM baselines. We found that while the
best AI and human reviews are comparable in quality, REMOR avoids the long tail
of low-quality human reviews. We discuss how reasoning is key to achieving
these improvements and release the Human-aligned Peer Review Reward (HPRR)
function, the Peer Review Reasoning-enriched Traces (PeerRT) dataset, and the
REMOR models, which we believe can help spur progress in the area.

Motivation: 验证在测试时扩展（TTS）中对LLMs的推理性能和计算效率有重要影响。传统验证方法仅验证最终输出或单个生成步骤，本文旨在系统研究验证粒度的影响。

Method: 引入Variable Granularity Search（VG-Search）算法，通过可调粒度参数g动态调整验证频率，结合了束搜索和Best-of-N采样的优点。

Result: 实验显示，动态选择g可显著提升计算效率和扩展行为。自适应VG-Search策略在准确性上比束搜索和Best-of-N分别提升3.1%和3.6%，同时减少52%以上的FLOPs。

Conclusion: VG-Search为LLMs的推理优化提供了新思路，未来将开源代码以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has proven effective in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Verification plays a key role in
TTS, simultaneously influencing (1) reasoning performance and (2) compute
efficiency, due to the quality and computational cost of verification. In this
work, we challenge the conventional paradigms of verification, and make the
first attempt toward systematically investigating the impact of verification
granularity-that is, how frequently the verifier is invoked during generation,
beyond verifying only the final output or individual generation steps. To this
end, we introduce Variable Granularity Search (VG-Search), a unified algorithm
that generalizes beam search and Best-of-N sampling via a tunable granularity
parameter g. Extensive experiments with VG-Search under varying compute
budgets, generator-verifier configurations, and task attributes reveal that
dynamically selecting g can improve the compute efficiency and scaling
behavior. Building on these findings, we propose adaptive VG-Search strategies
that achieve accuracy gains of up to 3.1\% over Beam Search and 3.6\% over
Best-of-N, while reducing FLOPs by over 52\%. We will open-source the code to
support future research.

Conclusion: SIRL通过结合优化求解器和RL，显著提升了LLM在优化建模中的性能，为可靠自动化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Optimization modeling is fundamental to decision-making across diverse
domains.Despite progress in automating optimization formulation from natural
language descriptions, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to generate
formally correct and usable models due to hallucinations, posing a challenge
for reliable automation. Inspired by the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL)
in enhancing Large Reasoning Models, we present Solver-Informed Reinforcement
Learning (SIRL).This novel framework leverages external optimization solvers as
verifiable reward mechanisms to significantly improve the authenticity of LLMs
for optimization modeling.Acting as precise verifiers, these solvers
automatically assess the executable code and the instance-level mathematical
model represented by the associated LP file, yielding precise and comprehensive
feedback signals -- including syntax, feasibility, and solution quality that
directly inform the RL process. This automated verification process, powered by
classic optimization solvers, also underpins our instance-enhanced
self-consistency method to synthesize high-quality training data. Extensive
experiments on diverse public benchmarks demonstrate that SIRL achieves
state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing methods in
generating accurate and executable optimization models.

ToLeaP, we identify four main critical challenges: (1) benchmark limitations
induce both the neglect and lack of (2) autonomous learning, (3)

future advancements, we take a step further toward exploring potential
directions, namely (1) real-world benchmark construction, (2)
compatibility-aware autonomous learning, (3) rationale learning by thinking,
and (4) identifying and recalling key clues. The preliminary experiments

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning has emerged as a crucial technique for generalizing
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). By generating and
analyzing counterfactual scenarios, researchers can assess the adaptability and
reliability of model decision-making. Although prior work has shown that LLMs
often struggle with counterfactual reasoning, it remains unclear which factors
most significantly impede their performance across different tasks and
modalities. In this paper, we propose a decompositional strategy that breaks
down the counterfactual generation from causality construction to the reasoning
over counterfactual interventions. To support decompositional analysis, we
investigate 11 datasets spanning diverse tasks, including natural language
understanding, mathematics, programming, and vision-language tasks. Through
extensive evaluations, we characterize LLM behavior across each decompositional
stage and identify how modality type and intermediate reasoning influence
performance. By establishing a structured framework for analyzing
counterfactual reasoning, this work contributes to the development of more
reliable LLM-based reasoning systems and informs future elicitation strategies.

Conclusion: LogiEval-Hard可作为诊断工具和测试平台，推动LLM逻辑推理能力的提升。

Abstract: Large reasoning models, often post-trained on long chain-of-thought (long
CoT) data with reinforcement learning, achieve state-of-the-art performance on
mathematical, coding, and domain-specific reasoning benchmarks. However, their
logical reasoning capabilities - fundamental to human cognition and independent
of domain knowledge - remain understudied. To address this gap, we introduce
LogiEval, a holistic benchmark for evaluating logical reasoning in large
reasoning models. LogiEval spans diverse reasoning types (deductive, inductive,
analogical, and abductive) and task formats (e.g., logical sequence, argument
analysis), sourced from high-quality human examinations (e.g., LSAT, GMAT). Our
experiments demonstrate that modern reasoning models excel at 4-choice argument
analysis problems and analogical reasoning, surpassing human performance, yet
exhibit uneven capabilities across reasoning types and formats, highlighting
limitations in their generalization. Our analysis reveals that human
performance does not mirror model failure distributions. To foster further
research, we curate LogiEval-Hard, a challenging subset identified through a
novel screening paradigm where small-model failures (Qwen3-30B-A3B) reliably
predict difficulties for larger models. Modern models show striking, consistent
failures on LogiEval-Hard. This demonstrates that fundamental reasoning
bottlenecks persist across model scales, and establishes LogiEval-Hard as both
a diagnostic tool and a rigorous testbed for advancing logical reasoning in
LLMs.

automatic label verification, reproducibility, and modular extensibility.
Extensive experiments reveal that conventional experience replay has limited
effectiveness for LLM agents due to irrelevant information and context length

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning for complex tasks inherently involves a

complicates this landscape by introducing its own challenging trade-off:
sophisticated Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) can be computationally
prohibitive if naively integrated with LLMs at test-time, while simpler, faster
methods may lack reliability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
FlexiVe, a novel generative verifier that flexibly balances computational
resources between rapid, reliable fast thinking and meticulous slow thinking
using a Flexible Allocation of Verification Budget strategy. We further propose
the Solve-Detect-Verify pipeline, an efficient inference-time scaling framework
that intelligently integrates FlexiVe, proactively identifying solution
completion points to trigger targeted verification and provide focused solver
feedback. Experiments show FlexiVe achieves superior accuracy in pinpointing
errors within reasoning traces on ProcessBench. Furthermore, on challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and CNMO), our full
approach outperforms baselines like self-consistency in reasoning accuracy and

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in multi-agent systems,
questions of fairness should extend beyond resource distribution and procedural
design to include the fairness of how agents communicate. Drawing from
organizational psychology, we introduce a novel framework for evaluating
Interactional fairness encompassing Interpersonal fairness (IF) and
Informational fairness (InfF) in LLM-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS). We
extend the theoretical grounding of Interactional Fairness to non-sentient
agents, reframing fairness as a socially interpretable signal rather than a
subjective experience. We then adapt established tools from organizational
justice research, including Colquitt's Organizational Justice Scale and the
Critical Incident Technique, to measure fairness as a behavioral property of
agent interaction. We validate our framework through a pilot study using
controlled simulations of a resource negotiation task. We systematically
manipulate tone, explanation quality, outcome inequality, and task framing
(collaborative vs. competitive) to assess how IF influences agent behavior.
Results show that tone and justification quality significantly affect
acceptance decisions even when objective outcomes are held constant. In
addition, the influence of IF vs. InfF varies with context. This work lays the
foundation for fairness auditing and norm-sensitive alignment in LLM-MAS.

a tiny synthetic-data generator pypi package built on provider-agnostic
LiteLLM. The generator lets practitioners mint their own tiny packs in any
language, domain, or difficulty, while ten ready-made packs already cover
Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian,
Spanish, and Turkish. Every dataset ships with Croissant metadata and
plug-and-play files for OpenAI-Evals, LangChain, and standard CI tools, so
teams can drop deterministic micro-benchmarks directly into pull-request gates,
prompt-engineering loops, and production dashboards without touching GPU
budgets. A complete TQB++ run adds only a few seconds to pipeline latency yet
reliably flags prompt-template errors, tokenizer drift, and fine-tuning
side-effects long before full-scale suites like MMLU or BIG-Bench would finish
configuring. The entire framework is released to accelerate continuous,

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based search agents have shown remarkable
capabilities in solving complex tasks by dynamically decomposing problems and
addressing them through interleaved reasoning and retrieval. However, this
interleaved paradigm introduces substantial efficiency bottlenecks. First, we
observe that both highly accurate and overly approximate retrieval methods
degrade system efficiency: exact search incurs significant retrieval overhead,
while coarse retrieval requires additional reasoning steps during generation.
Second, we identify inefficiencies in system design, including improper
scheduling and frequent retrieval stalls, which lead to cascading latency --
where even minor delays in retrieval amplify end-to-end inference time. To
address these challenges, we introduce SearchAgent-X, a high-efficiency
inference framework for LLM-based search agents. SearchAgent-X leverages
high-recall approximate retrieval and incorporates two key techniques:
priority-aware scheduling and non-stall retrieval. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SearchAgent-X consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
systems such as vLLM and HNSW-based retrieval across diverse tasks, achieving
up to 3.4$\times$ higher throughput and 5$\times$ lower latency, without

Abstract: Assessing the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and reason
within the constraints of interactive environments is crucial for developing
capable AI agents. We introduce $\textbf{LLM-BabyBench}$, a new benchmark suite
designed specifically for this purpose. Built upon a textual adaptation of the
procedurally generated BabyAI grid world, this suite evaluates LLMs on three
fundamental aspects of grounded intelligence: (1) predicting the consequences
of actions on the environment state ($\textbf{Predict}$ task), (2) generating
sequences of low-level actions to achieve specified objectives ($\textbf{Plan}$
task), and (3) decomposing high-level instructions into coherent subgoal
sequences ($\textbf{Decompose}$ task). We detail the methodology for generating
the three corresponding datasets ($\texttt{LLM-BabyBench-Predict}$,
$\texttt{-Plan}$, $\texttt{-Decompose}$) by extracting structured information
from an expert agent operating within the text-based environment. Furthermore,
we provide a standardized evaluation harness and metrics, including environment
interaction for validating generated plans, to facilitate reproducible
assessment of diverse LLMs. Initial baseline results highlight the challenges
posed by these grounded reasoning tasks. The benchmark suite, datasets, data
generation code, and evaluation code are made publicly available
($\href{https://github.com/choukrani/llm-babybench}{\text{GitHub}}$,

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently demonstrate reasoning limitations,
often conflating content plausibility (i.e., material inference) with logical
validity (i.e., formal inference). This can result in biased inferences, where
plausible arguments are incorrectly deemed logically valid or vice versa.
Mitigating this limitation is critical, as it undermines the trustworthiness
and generalizability of LLMs in applications that demand rigorous logical
consistency. This paper investigates the problem of mitigating content biases
on formal reasoning through activation steering. Specifically, we curate a
controlled syllogistic reasoning dataset to disentangle formal validity from
content plausibility. After localising the layers responsible for formal and
material inference, we investigate contrastive activation steering methods for
test-time interventions. An extensive empirical analysis on different LLMs
reveals that contrastive steering consistently supports linear control over
content biases. However, we observe that a static approach is insufficient for
improving all the tested models. We then leverage the possibility to control
content effects by dynamically determining the value of the steering parameters
via fine-grained conditional methods. We found that conditional steering is
effective on unresponsive models, achieving up to 15% absolute improvement in
formal reasoning accuracy with a newly introduced kNN-based method (K-CAST).
Finally, additional experiments reveal that steering for content effects is
robust to prompt variations, incurs minimal side effects on language modeling
capabilities, and can partially generalize to out-of-distribution reasoning
tasks. Practically, this paper demonstrates that activation-level interventions
can offer a scalable strategy for enhancing the robustness of LLMs,
contributing towards more systematic and unbiased formal reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少推理路径长度，同时维持或提高模型性能，适用于资源敏感场景。

Abstract: Large reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 or DeepSeek R1, have demonstrated
remarkable performance on reasoning tasks but often incur a long reasoning path

shorten reasoning paths by introducing additional training data and stages. In
this paper, we propose three critical reward designs integrated directly into
the reinforcement learning process of large reasoning models, which reduce the
response length without extra training stages. Experiments on four settings
show that our method significantly decreases response length while maintaining
or even improving performance. Specifically, in a logic reasoning setting, we
achieve a 40% reduction in response length averaged by steps alongside a 14%
gain in performance. For math problems, we reduce response length averaged by
steps by 33% while preserving performance.

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful evaluators in the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm,
offering significant efficiency and flexibility compared to human judgments.
However, previous methods primarily rely on single-point evaluations,
overlooking the inherent diversity and uncertainty in human evaluations. This
approach leads to information loss and decreases the reliability of
evaluations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel training framework
that explicitly aligns the LLM-generated judgment distribution with empirical
human distributions. Specifically, we propose a distributional alignment
objective based on KL divergence, combined with an auxiliary cross-entropy
regularization to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, considering that
empirical distributions may derive from limited human annotations, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance model robustness against
distribution perturbations. Extensive experiments across various LLM backbones
and evaluation tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing closed-source LLMs and conventional single-point alignment methods,
with improved alignment quality, evaluation accuracy, and robustness.

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中平均准确率显著提升，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知的策略优化能有效提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit varying levels of confidence across
input prompts (questions): some lead to consistent, semantically similar
answers, while others yield diverse or contradictory outputs. This variation
reflects LLM's uncertainty about the input prompt, a signal of how confidently
the model understands a given problem. However, vanilla Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) treats all prompts equally during policy updates, ignoring
this important information about the model's knowledge boundaries. To address
this limitation, we propose SEED-GRPO (Semantic Entropy EnhanceD GRPO), which
explicitly measures LLMs' uncertainty of the input prompts semantic entropy.
Semantic entropy measures the diversity of meaning in multiple generated
answers given a prompt and uses this to modulate the magnitude of policy
updates. This uncertainty-aware training mechanism enables dynamic adjustment
of policy update magnitudes based on question uncertainty. It allows more
conservative updates on high-uncertainty questions while maintaining the
original learning signal on confident ones. Experimental results on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24 56.7, AMC 68.7, MATH 83.4, Minerva
34.2, and OlympiadBench 48.0) demonstrate that SEED-GRPO achieves new
state-of-the-art performance in average accuracy, validating the effectiveness
of uncertainty-aware policy optimization.

Conclusion: CoT-Verify范式通过避免分解步骤提高了声明验证的准确性，Reasoning-CV方法展示了LLM在复杂任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Claim verification is essential in combating misinformation, and large
language models (LLMs) have recently emerged in this area as powerful tools for
assessing the veracity of claims using external knowledge. Existing LLM-based
methods for claim verification typically adopt a Decompose-Then-Verify
paradigm, which involves decomposing complex claims into several independent
sub-claims and verifying each sub-claim separately. However, this paradigm
often introduces errors during the claim decomposition process. To mitigate
these errors, we propose to develop the Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-Verify paradigm,
which leverages LLM reasoning methods to generate CoT-verification paths for
the original complex claim without requiring decompositions into sub-claims and
separate verification stages. The CoT-Verify paradigm allows us to propose a
natural fine-tuning method called Reasoning-CV to enhance the verification
capabilities in LLMs. Reasoning-CV includes a supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
stage and a self-improvement direct preference optimization (DPO) stage.
Utilizing only an 8B pre-trained LLM, Reasoning-CV demonstrates superior
knowledge-assisted claim verification performances compared to existing
Decompose-Then-Verify methods, as well as powerful black-box LLMs such as
GPT-4o+CoT and o1-preview. Our code is available.

Abstract: Acquiring the parameters of neural networks (NNs) has been one of the most

descriptions of the data, task, and network architecture. Stage one is
Parameter Reference Knowledge Injection, where LLMs are pretrained on NN
checkpoints to build foundational understanding of parameter space, whereas
stage two is Context-Enhanced Instruction Tuning, enabling LLMs to adapt to
specific tasks through enriched, task-aware prompts. Experimental results
demonstrate that NeuroGen effectively generates usable NN parameters. Our

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at rapid generation of text and multimodal
content, yet they falter on transaction-style planning that demands ACID-like
guarantees and real-time disruption recovery. We present Adaptive LLM Agent
System (ALAS), a framework that tackles four fundamental LLM deficits: (i)
absence of self-verification, (ii) context erosion, (iii) next-token myopia,
and (iv) lack of persistent state. ALAS decomposes each plan into
role-specialized agents, equips them with automatic state tracking, and
coordinates them through a lightweight protocol. When disruptions arise, agents
apply history-aware local compensation, avoiding costly global replanning and
containing cascade effects. On real-world, large-scale job-shop scheduling
benchmarks, ALAS sets new best results for static sequential planning and
excels in dynamic reactive scenarios with unexpected disruptions. These gains
show that principled modularization plus targeted compensation can unlock
scalable and resilient planning with LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactions where
they are prompted to adopt personas. This paper investigates whether such
persona conditioning affects model safety under bullying, an adversarial
manipulation that applies psychological pressures in order to force the victim
to comply to the attacker. We introduce a simulation framework in which an
attacker LLM engages a victim LLM using psychologically grounded bullying
tactics, while the victim adopts personas aligned with the Big Five personality
traits. Experiments using multiple open-source LLMs and a wide range of
adversarial goals reveal that certain persona configurations -- such as
weakened agreeableness or conscientiousness -- significantly increase victim's
susceptibility to unsafe outputs. Bullying tactics involving emotional or
sarcastic manipulation, such as gaslighting and ridicule, are particularly
effective. These findings suggest that persona-driven interaction introduces a
novel vector for safety risks in LLMs and highlight the need for persona-aware
safety evaluation and alignment strategies.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal method for
expanding the knowledge of large language models. To handle complex queries
more effectively, researchers developed Adaptive-RAG (A-RAG) to enhance the
generated quality through multiple interactions with external knowledge bases.
Despite its effectiveness, A-RAG exacerbates the pre-existing efficiency
challenges inherent in RAG, which are attributable to its reliance on multiple
iterations of generation. Existing A-RAG approaches process all retrieved
contents from scratch. However, they ignore the situation where there is a
significant overlap in the content of the retrieval results across rounds. The
overlapping content is redundantly represented, which leads to a large
proportion of repeated computations, thus affecting the overall efficiency. To
address this issue, this paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that can be
generally applied to A-RAG methods, which is dedicated to reducing the
redundant representation process caused by the overlapping of retrieval
results. Specifically, we use cache access and parallel generation to speed up
the prefilling and decoding stages respectively. Additionally, we also propose
an instruction-driven module to further guide the model to more effectively
attend to each part of the content in a more suitable way for LLMs. Experiments
show that our approach achieves 2.79 and 2.33 times significant acceleration on
average for prefilling and decoding respectively while maintaining equal
generation quality.

Abstract: As higher-level intelligence emerges from the combination of modular
components with lower-level intelligence, many works combines Large Language
Models (LLMs) for collective intelligence. Such combination is achieved by
building communications among LLMs. While current systems primarily facilitate
such communication through natural language, this paper proposes a novel
paradigm of direct dense vector communication between LLMs. Our approach
eliminates the unnecessary embedding and de-embedding steps when LLM interact
with another, enabling more efficient information transfer, fully
differentiable optimization pathways, and exploration of capabilities beyond
human heuristics. We use such stripped LLMs as vertexes and optimizable seq2seq
modules as edges to construct LMNet, with similar structure as MLPs. By
utilizing smaller pre-trained LLMs as vertexes, we train a LMNet that achieves
comparable performance with LLMs in similar size with only less than 0.1%
training cost. This offers a new perspective on scaling for general
intelligence rather than training a monolithic LLM from scratch. Besides, the
proposed method can be used for other applications, like customizing LLM with
limited data, showing its versatility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance through
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) on diverse instructional datasets. When training
on multiple capabilities simultaneously, the mixture training dataset, governed
by volumes of data from different domains, is a critical factor that directly
impacts the final model's performance. Unlike many studies that focus on
enhancing the quality of training datasets through data selection methods, few
works explore the intricate relationship between the compositional quantity of
mixture training datasets and the emergent capabilities of LLMs. Given the
availability of a high-quality multi-domain training dataset, understanding the
impact of data from each domain on the model's overall capabilities is crucial
for preparing SFT data and training a well-balanced model that performs
effectively across diverse domains. In this work, we introduce IDEAL, an
innovative data equilibrium adaptation framework designed to effectively
optimize volumes of data from different domains within mixture SFT datasets,
thereby enhancing the model's alignment and performance across multiple
capabilities. IDEAL employs a gradient-based approach to iteratively refine the
training data distribution, dynamically adjusting the volumes of
domain-specific data based on their impact on downstream task performance. By
leveraging this adaptive mechanism, IDEAL ensures a balanced dataset
composition, enabling the model to achieve robust generalization and consistent
proficiency across diverse tasks. Experiments across different capabilities
demonstrate that IDEAL outperforms conventional uniform data allocation
strategies, achieving a comprehensive improvement of approximately 7% in
multi-task evaluation scores.

Abstract: Evaluating the open-ended outputs of large language models (LLMs) has become
a bottleneck as model capabilities, task diversity, and modality coverage
rapidly expand. Existing "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluators are typically narrow in a
few tasks, aspects, or modalities, and easily suffer from low consistency. In
this paper, we argue that explicit, fine-grained aspect specification is the
key to both generalizability and objectivity in automated evaluation. To do so,
we introduce a hierarchical aspect taxonomy spanning 112 aspects that unifies
evaluation across four representative settings - Natural Language Generation,
Image Understanding, Image Generation, and Interleaved Text-and-Image
Generation. Building on this taxonomy, we create FRAbench, a benchmark
comprising 60.4k pairwise samples with 325k aspect-level labels obtained from a
combination of human and LLM annotations. FRAbench provides the first
large-scale, multi-modal resource for training and meta-evaluating fine-grained
LMM judges. Leveraging FRAbench, we develop GenEval, a fine-grained evaluator
generalizable across tasks and modalities. Experiments show that GenEval (i)
attains high agreement with GPT-4o and expert annotators, (ii) transfers
robustly to unseen tasks and modalities, and (iii) reveals systematic
weaknesses of current LMMs on evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models struggle with representing and generating rare tokens
despite their importance in specialized domains. In this study, we identify
neuron structures with exceptionally strong influence on language model's
prediction of rare tokens, termed as rare token neurons, and investigate the
mechanism for their emergence and behavior. These neurons exhibit a
characteristic three-phase organization (plateau, power-law, and rapid decay)
that emerges dynamically during training, evolving from a homogeneous initial
state to a functionally differentiated architecture. In the activation space,
rare token neurons form a coordinated subnetwork that selectively co-activates
while avoiding co-activation with other neurons. This functional specialization
potentially correlates with the development of heavy-tailed weight
distributions, suggesting a statistical mechanical basis for emergent
specialization.

Abstract: As the field progresses toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), there
is a pressing need for more comprehensive and insightful evaluation frameworks
that go beyond aggregate performance metrics. This paper introduces a unified
rating system that jointly models the difficulty of individual test cases and
the competency of AI models (or humans) across vision, language, and action
domains. Unlike existing metrics that focus solely on models, our approach
allows for fine-grained, difficulty-aware evaluations through competitive
interactions between models and tasks, capturing both the long-tail
distribution of real-world challenges and the competency gap between current
models and full task mastery. We validate the generalizability and robustness
of our system through extensive experiments on multiple established datasets
and models across distinct AGI domains. The resulting rating distributions
offer novel perspectives and interpretable insights into task difficulty, model
progression, and the outstanding challenges that remain on the path to
achieving full AGI task mastery.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in
multi-step reasoning tasks. However, alongside these successes, a more
deceptive form of model error has emerged--Reasoning Hallucination--where
logically coherent but factually incorrect reasoning traces lead to persuasive
yet faulty conclusions. Unlike traditional hallucinations, these errors are
embedded within structured reasoning, making them more difficult to detect and
potentially more harmful. In this work, we investigate reasoning hallucinations
from a mechanistic perspective. We propose the Reasoning Score, which
quantifies the depth of reasoning by measuring the divergence between logits
obtained from projecting late layers of LRMs to the vocabulary space,
effectively distinguishing shallow pattern-matching from genuine deep
reasoning. Using this score, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the ReTruthQA
dataset and identify two key reasoning hallucination patterns: early-stage
fluctuation in reasoning depth and incorrect backtracking to flawed prior
steps. These insights motivate our Reasoning Hallucination Detection (RHD)
framework, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains.
To mitigate reasoning hallucinations, we further introduce GRPO-R, an enhanced
reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates step-level deep reasoning
rewards via potential-based shaping. Our theoretical analysis establishes
stronger generalization guarantees, and experiments demonstrate improved
reasoning quality and reduced hallucination rates.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly assume roles where trust and alignment with human
values are essential, understanding when and why they engage in deception has
become a critical research priority. We introduce The Traitors, a multi-agent
simulation framework inspired by social deduction games, designed to probe
deception, trust formation, and strategic communication among large language
model (LLM) agents under asymmetric information. A minority of agents the
traitors seek to mislead the majority, while the faithful must infer hidden
identities through dialogue and reasoning. Our contributions are: (1) we ground
the environment in formal frameworks from game theory, behavioral economics,
and social cognition; (2) we develop a suite of evaluation metrics capturing
deception success, trust dynamics, and collective inference quality; (3) we
implement a fully autonomous simulation platform where LLMs reason over
persistent memory and evolving social dynamics, with support for heterogeneous
agent populations, specialized traits, and adaptive behaviors. Our initial
experiments across DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o (10 runs per model)
reveal a notable asymmetry: advanced models like GPT-4o demonstrate superior
deceptive capabilities yet exhibit disproportionate vulnerability to others'
falsehoods. This suggests deception skills may scale faster than detection
abilities. Overall, The Traitors provides a focused, configurable testbed for
investigating LLM behavior in socially nuanced interactions. We position this
work as a contribution toward more rigorous research on deception mechanisms,
alignment challenges, and the broader social reliability of AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the field of artificial
intelligence (AI) and are a powerful enabler for interactive systems. However,
they still face challenges in long-term interactions that require adaptation
towards the user as well as contextual knowledge and understanding of the
ever-changing environment. To overcome these challenges, holistic memory
modeling is required to efficiently retrieve and store relevant information
across interaction sessions for suitable responses. Cognitive AI, which aims to
simulate the human thought process in a computerized model, highlights
interesting aspects, such as thoughts, memory mechanisms, and decision-making,
that can contribute towards improved memory modeling for LLMs. Inspired by
these cognitive AI principles, we propose our memory framework CAIM. CAIM
consists of three modules: 1.) The Memory Controller as the central decision
unit; 2.) the Memory Retrieval, which filters relevant data for interaction
upon request; and 3.) the Post-Thinking, which maintains the memory storage. We
compare CAIM against existing approaches, focusing on metrics such as retrieval
accuracy, response correctness, contextual coherence, and memory storage. The
results demonstrate that CAIM outperforms baseline frameworks across different
metrics, highlighting its context-awareness and potential to improve long-term

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了LLMs建模整体序列结构的能力，而仅关注局部特征映射。SGCMA旨在通过结构一致性实现更有效的跨模态对齐。

Method: SGCMA包含结构对齐和语义对齐两部分：前者通过HMMs和MEMM学习状态转移矩阵，后者通过跨注意力机制对齐时间序列与语言数据。

Result: 实验表明SGCMA在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SGCMA为时间序列预测中的跨模态对齐提供了一种新方法，强调了序列结构一致性的重要性。

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs)
for time series forecasting has predominantly employed linguistic-temporal
modality alignment strategies through token-level or layer-wise feature
mapping. However, these approaches fundamentally neglect a critical insight:
the core competency of LLMs resides not merely in processing localized token
features but in their inherent capacity to model holistic sequence structures.
This paper posits that effective cross-modal alignment necessitates structural
consistency at the sequence level. We propose the Structure-Guided Cross-Modal
Alignment (SGCMA), a framework that fully exploits and aligns the
state-transition graph structures shared by time-series and linguistic data as
sequential modalities, thereby endowing time series with language-like
properties and delivering stronger generalization after modality alignment.
SGCMA consists of two key components, namely Structure Alignment and Semantic
Alignment. In Structure Alignment, a state transition matrix is learned from
text data through Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and a shallow transformer-based
Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) receives the hot-start transition matrix
and annotates each temporal patch into state probability, ensuring that the
temporal representation sequence inherits language-like sequential dynamics. In
Semantic Alignment, cross-attention is applied between temporal patches and the
top-k tokens within each state, and the ultimate temporal embeddings are
derived by the expected value of these embeddings using a weighted average
based on state probabilities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate
that SGCMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a novel approach to
cross-modal alignment in time series forecasting.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world decision-making systems, understanding their behavioural
vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge for AI safety and alignment. While
existing evaluation metrics focus primarily on reasoning accuracy or factual
correctness, they often overlook whether LLMs are robust to adversarial
manipulation or capable of using adaptive strategy in dynamic environments.
This paper introduces an adversarial evaluation framework designed to
systematically stress-test the decision-making processes of LLMs under
interactive and adversarial conditions. Drawing on methodologies from cognitive
psychology and game theory, our framework probes how models respond in two
canonical tasks: the two-armed bandit task and the Multi-Round Trust Task.
These tasks capture key aspects of exploration-exploitation trade-offs, social
cooperation, and strategic flexibility. We apply this framework to several
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini-1.5, and DeepSeek-V3,
revealing model-specific susceptibilities to manipulation and rigidity in
strategy adaptation. Our findings highlight distinct behavioral patterns across
models and emphasize the importance of adaptability and fairness recognition
for trustworthy AI deployment. Rather than offering a performance benchmark,
this work proposes a methodology for diagnosing decision-making weaknesses in
LLM-based agents, providing actionable insights for alignment and safety
research.

Motivation: 零样本模型在微调时容易学习虚假特征（如背景或纹理），导致鲁棒性下降。

Result: 在Waterbirds数据集上，StarFT显著提升了最差组和平均准确率（分别提高14.30%和3.02%）。

Conclusion: StarFT有效提升了零样本模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning robust representations from data often requires scale, which has led
to the success of recent zero-shot models such as CLIP. However, the obtained
robustness can easily be deteriorated when these models are fine-tuned on other
downstream tasks (e.g., of smaller scales). Previous works often interpret this
phenomenon in the context of domain shift, developing fine-tuning methods that
aim to preserve the original domain as much as possible. However, in a
different context, fine-tuned models with limited data are also prone to
learning features that are spurious to humans, such as background or texture.
In this paper, we propose StarFT (Spurious Textual Alignment Regularization), a
novel framework for fine-tuning zero-shot models to enhance robustness by
preventing them from learning spuriosity. We introduce a regularization that
aligns the output distribution for spuriosity-injected labels with the original
zero-shot model, ensuring that the model is not induced to extract irrelevant
features further from these descriptions.We leverage recent language models to
get such spuriosity-injected labels by generating alternative textual
descriptions that highlight potentially confounding features.Extensive
experiments validate the robust generalization of StarFT and its emerging
properties: zero-shot group robustness and improved zero-shot classification.
Notably, StarFT boosts both worst-group and average accuracy by 14.30% and
3.02%, respectively, in the Waterbirds group shift scenario, where other robust
fine-tuning baselines show even degraded performance.

Conclusion: CompeteSMoE为SMoE训练提供了一种高效解决方案，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) offers an appealing solution to scale up the
model complexity beyond the mean of increasing the network's depth or width.
However, we argue that effective SMoE training remains challenging because of
the suboptimal routing process where experts that perform computation do not
directly contribute to the routing process. In this work, we propose
competition, a novel mechanism to route tokens to experts with the highest
neural response. Theoretically, we show that the competition mechanism enjoys a
better sample efficiency than the traditional softmax routing. Furthermore, we
develop CompeteSMoE, a simple yet effective algorithm to train large language
models by deploying a router to learn the competition policy, thus enjoying
strong performances at a low training overhead. Our extensive empirical
evaluations on both the visual instruction tuning and language pre-training
tasks demonstrate the efficacy, robustness, and scalability of CompeteSMoE
compared to state-of-the-art SMoE strategies. We have made the implementation

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models significantly improve the reasoning ability of
Large Language Models by learning to reason, exhibiting the promising
performance in solving complex tasks. LRMs solve tasks that require complex
reasoning by explicitly generating reasoning trajectories together with
answers. Nevertheless, judging the quality of such an output answer is not easy
because only considering the correctness of the answer is not enough and the
soundness of the reasoning trajectory part matters as well. Logically, if the
soundness of the reasoning part is poor, even if the answer is correct, the
confidence of the derived answer should be low. Existing methods did consider
jointly assessing the overall output answer by taking into account the
reasoning part, however, their capability is still not satisfactory as the
causal relationship of the reasoning to the concluded answer cannot properly
reflected. In this paper, inspired by classical mechanics, we present a novel
approach towards establishing a CoT-Kinetics energy equation. Specifically, our
CoT-Kinetics energy equation formulates the token state transformation process,
which is regulated by LRM internal transformer layers, as like a particle
kinetics dynamics governed in a mechanical field. Our CoT-Kinetics energy
assigns a scalar score to evaluate specifically the soundness of the reasoning
phase, telling how confident the derived answer could be given the evaluated
reasoning. As such, the LRM's overall output quality can be accurately
measured, rather than a coarse judgment (e.g., correct or incorrect) anymore.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive
progress in vision-language understanding, they still struggle with complex
multi-step reasoning, often producing logically inconsistent or partially
correct solutions. A key limitation lies in the lack of fine-grained
supervision over intermediate reasoning steps. To address this, we propose
MM-PRM, a process reward model trained within a fully automated, scalable
framework. We first build MM-Policy, a strong multimodal model trained on
diverse mathematical reasoning data. Then, we construct MM-K12, a curated
dataset of 10,000 multimodal math problems with verifiable answers, which
serves as seed data. Leveraging a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based
pipeline, we generate over 700k step-level annotations without human labeling.
The resulting PRM is used to score candidate reasoning paths in the Best-of-N
inference setup and achieves significant improvements across both in-domain
(MM-K12 test set) and out-of-domain (OlympiadBench, MathVista, etc.)
benchmarks. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of soft labels, smaller
learning rates, and path diversity in optimizing PRM performance. MM-PRM
demonstrates that process supervision is a powerful tool for enhancing the
logical robustness of multimodal reasoning systems. We release all our codes

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have shown improved performance in generating accurate responses.
However, the dependence on external knowledge bases introduces potential
security vulnerabilities, particularly when these knowledge bases are publicly
accessible and modifiable. Poisoning attacks on knowledge bases for RAG systems
face two fundamental challenges: the injected malicious content must compete
with multiple authentic documents retrieved by the retriever, and LLMs tend to
trust retrieved information that aligns with their internal memorized
knowledge. Previous works attempt to address these challenges by injecting
multiple malicious documents, but such saturation attacks are easily detectable
and impractical in real-world scenarios. To enable the effective single
document poisoning attack, we propose AuthChain, a novel knowledge poisoning
attack method that leverages Chain-of-Evidence theory and authority effect to
craft more convincing poisoned documents. AuthChain generates poisoned content
that establishes strong evidence chains and incorporates authoritative
statements, effectively overcoming the interference from both authentic
documents and LLMs' internal knowledge. Extensive experiments across six
popular LLMs demonstrate that AuthChain achieves significantly higher attack
success rates while maintaining superior stealthiness against RAG defense
mechanisms compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Recent research highlights concerns about the trustworthiness of third-party
Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) due to potential backdoor attacks. These
backdoored PTLMs, however, are effective only for specific pre-defined
downstream tasks. In reality, these PTLMs can be adapted to many other
unrelated downstream tasks. Such adaptation may lead to unforeseen consequences
in downstream model outputs, consequently raising user suspicion and
compromising attack stealthiness. We refer to this phenomenon as backdoor
complications. In this paper, we undertake the first comprehensive
quantification of backdoor complications. Through extensive experiments using 4
prominent PTLMs and 16 text classification benchmark datasets, we demonstrate
the widespread presence of backdoor complications in downstream models
fine-tuned from backdoored PTLMs. The output distribution of triggered samples
significantly deviates from that of clean samples. Consequently, we propose a
backdoor complication reduction method leveraging multi-task learning to
mitigate complications without prior knowledge of downstream tasks. The
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively
reduce complications while maintaining the efficacy and consistency of backdoor
attacks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: OMAC是一个用于优化基于LLM的多智能体系统（MAS）的通用框架，通过五个关键维度优化智能体功能和协作结构，并在代码生成、算术推理等任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前多智能体系统的发展依赖手工方法，缺乏系统性设计和优化的研究，因此提出了OMAC框架来解决这一问题。

Method: OMAC通过两个核心算法（语义初始化器和对比比较器）优化单个维度，并提出联合优化多个维度的算法。

Result: 实验表明，OMAC在代码生成、算术推理和通用推理任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OMAC为LLM-based MAS的系统性优化提供了有效框架，展示了多智能体协作的潜力。

Abstract: Agents powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across diverse complex applications. Recently,
Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), wherein multiple agents collaborate and communicate
with each other, have exhibited enhanced capabilities in complex tasks, such as
high-quality code generation and arithmetic reasoning. However, the development
of such systems often relies on handcrafted methods, and the literature on
systematic design and optimization of LLM-based MAS remains limited.
  In this work, we introduce OMAC, a general framework designed for holistic
optimization of LLM-based MAS. Specifically, we identify five key optimization
dimensions for MAS, encompassing both agent functionality and collaboration
structure. Building upon these dimensions, we first propose a general
algorithm, utilizing two actors termed the Semantic Initializer and the
Contrastive Comparator, to optimize any single dimension. Then, we present an
algorithm for joint optimization across multiple dimensions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of OMAC on code generation,
arithmetic reasoning, and general reasoning tasks against state-of-the-art
approaches.

TL;DR: LightRetriever是一种基于LLM的轻量级混合检索器，通过极简化的查询编码器实现高效检索，同时保留文档编码的全尺寸LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在检索任务中表现优异，但深度参数化的LLM导致查询推理速度慢且资源需求高，因此需要轻量化的解决方案。

Method: 保留全尺寸LLM用于文档编码，将查询编码简化为嵌入查找，显著降低计算负载。

Result: 在H800 GPU上实现1000倍加速，无GPU时20倍加速，性能保留95%。

Conclusion: LightRetriever在高效性和性能之间取得了平衡，适用于大规模检索任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based hybrid retrieval uses LLMs to encode
queries and documents into low-dimensional dense or high-dimensional sparse
vectors. It retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector
similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in
real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs
significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs
slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online
deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel
LLM-based hybrid retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our
method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload
of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a
full-sized LLM on an H800 GPU, our approach achieves over a 1000x speedup for
query inference with GPU acceleration, and even a 20x speedup without GPU.
Experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method
generalizes well across diverse retrieval tasks, retaining an average of 95%
full-sized performance.

Result: 基线模型误报率高，Lakera Guard和ProtectAI LLM Guard表现最佳。

Conclusion: 建议提高闭源工具的透明度、改进上下文感知检测、增强开源参与、提升用户意识及采用更具代表性的性能指标。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into critical
systems in industries like healthcare and finance. Users can often submit
queries to LLM-enabled chatbots, some of which can enrich responses with
information retrieved from internal databases storing sensitive data. This
gives rise to a range of attacks in which a user submits a malicious query and
the LLM-system outputs a response that creates harm to the owner, such as
leaking internal data or creating legal liability by harming a third-party.
While security tools are being developed to counter these threats, there is
little formal evaluation of their effectiveness and usability. This study
addresses this gap by conducting a thorough comparative analysis of LLM
security tools. We identified 13 solutions (9 closed-source, 4 open-source),
but only 7 were evaluated due to a lack of participation by proprietary model
owners.To evaluate, we built a benchmark dataset of malicious prompts, and
evaluate these tools performance against a baseline LLM model
(ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo). Our results show that the baseline model has too many
false positives to be used for this task. Lakera Guard and ProtectAI LLM Guard
emerged as the best overall tools showcasing the tradeoff between usability and
performance. The study concluded with recommendations for greater transparency
among closed source providers, improved context-aware detections, enhanced
open-source engagement, increased user awareness, and the adoption of more
representative performance metrics.

Conclusion: LAMeTA通过结合意图理解和动态优化，显著提升了代理网络的性能。

Abstract: Nowadays, Generative AI (GenAI) reshapes numerous domains by enabling
machines to create content across modalities. As GenAI evolves into autonomous
agents capable of reasoning, collaboration, and interaction, they are
increasingly deployed on network infrastructures to serve humans automatically.
This emerging paradigm, known as the agentic network, presents new optimization
challenges due to the demand to incorporate subjective intents of human users
expressed in natural language. Traditional generic Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) struggles to capture intent semantics and adjust policies dynamically,
thus leading to suboptimality. In this paper, we present LAMeTA, a Large AI
Model (LAM)-empowered Two-stage Approach for intent-aware agentic network
optimization. First, we propose Intent-oriented Knowledge Distillation (IoKD),
which efficiently distills intent-understanding capabilities from
resource-intensive LAMs to lightweight edge LAMs (E-LAMs) to serve end users.
Second, we develop Symbiotic Reinforcement Learning (SRL), integrating E-LAMs
with a policy-based DRL framework. In SRL, E-LAMs translate natural language
user intents into structured preference vectors that guide both state
representation and reward design. The DRL, in turn, optimizes the generative
service function chain composition and E-LAM selection based on real-time
network conditions, thus optimizing the subjective Quality-of-Experience (QoE).
Extensive experiments conducted in an agentic network with 81 agents
demonstrate that IoKD reduces mean squared error in intent prediction by up to
22.5%, while SRL outperforms conventional generic DRL by up to 23.5% in
maximizing intent-aware QoE.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have been widely deployed
in a wide range of applications in the real world, including healthcare
diagnostics, financial analysis, customer support, robotics, and autonomous
driving, expanding their powerful capability of understanding, reasoning, and

Training-Phase Attacks, Inference-Phase Attacks, and Availability & Integrity
Attacks. For each phase, we analyze the details of representative and recently

Abstract: A central goal of cognitive modeling is to develop models that not only
predict human behavior but also provide insight into the underlying cognitive
mechanisms. While neural network models trained on large-scale behavioral data
often achieve strong predictive performance, they typically fall short in
offering interpretable explanations of the cognitive processes they capture. In
this work, we explore the potential of pretrained large language models (LLMs)
to serve as dual-purpose cognitive models--capable of both accurate prediction
and interpretable explanation in natural language. Specifically, we employ
reinforcement learning with outcome-based rewards to guide LLMs toward
generating explicit reasoning traces for explaining human risky choices. Our

Abstract: Spatiotemporal reasoning plays a key role in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).
Despite advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs), their capacity to reason about complex spatiotemporal signals remains
underexplored. This paper proposes a hierarchical SpatioTemporal reAsoning
benchmaRK, STARK, to systematically evaluate LLMs across three levels of
reasoning complexity: state estimation (e.g., predicting field variables,
localizing and tracking events in space and time), spatiotemporal reasoning
over states (e.g., inferring spatial-temporal relationships), and
world-knowledge-aware reasoning that integrates contextual and domain knowledge
(e.g., intent prediction, landmark-aware navigation). We curate 26 distinct
spatiotemporal tasks with diverse sensor modalities, comprising 14,552
challenges where models answer directly or by Python Code Interpreter.
Evaluating 3 LRMs and 8 LLMs, we find LLMs achieve limited success in tasks
requiring geometric reasoning (e.g., multilateration or triangulation),
particularly as complexity increases. Surprisingly, LRMs show robust
performance across tasks with various levels of difficulty, often competing or
surpassing traditional first-principle-based methods. Our results show that in
reasoning tasks requiring world knowledge, the performance gap between LLMs and
LRMs narrows, with some LLMs even surpassing LRMs. However, the LRM o3 model
continues to achieve leading performance across all evaluated tasks, a result
attributed primarily to the larger size of the reasoning models. STARK
motivates future innovations in model architectures and reasoning paradigms for
intelligent CPS by providing a structured framework to identify limitations in
the spatiotemporal reasoning of LLMs and LRMs.

Conclusion: DMN引导的提示框架有效提升了LLMs在复杂决策任务中的表现，并增强了用户友好性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown considerable potential in automating
decision logic within knowledge-intensive processes. However, their
effectiveness largely depends on the strategy and quality of prompting. Since
decision logic is typically embedded in prompts, it becomes challenging for end
users to modify or refine it. Decision Model and Notation (DMN) offers a
standardized graphical approach for defining decision logic in a structured,
user-friendly manner. This paper introduces a DMN-guided prompting framework
that breaks down complex decision logic into smaller, manageable components,
guiding LLMs through structured decision pathways. We implemented the framework
in a graduate-level course where students submitted assignments. The
assignments and DMN models representing feedback instructions served as inputs
to our framework. The instructor evaluated the generated feedback and labeled
it for performance assessment. Our approach demonstrated promising results,
outperforming chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Students also responded
positively to the generated feedback, reporting high levels of perceived
usefulness in a survey based on the Technology Acceptance Model.

Conclusion: MTRE通过利用早期令牌的完整logits序列，显著提升了幻觉检测的准确性，为VLM的可靠性评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) now rival human performance on many multimodal
tasks, yet they still hallucinate objects or generate unsafe text. Current
hallucination detectors, e.g., single-token linear probing (SLP) and P(True),
typically analyze only the logit of the first generated token or just its
highest scoring component overlooking richer signals embedded within earlier
token distributions. We demonstrate that analyzing the complete sequence of
early logits potentially provides substantially more diagnostic information. We
emphasize that hallucinations may only emerge after several tokens, as subtle
inconsistencies accumulate over time. By analyzing the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence between logits corresponding to hallucinated and non-hallucinated
tokens, we underscore the importance of incorporating later-token logits to
more accurately capture the reliability dynamics of VLMs. In response, we
introduce Multi-Token Reliability Estimation (MTRE), a lightweight, white-box
method that aggregates logits from the first ten tokens using multi-token
log-likelihood ratios and self-attention. Despite the challenges posed by large
vocabulary sizes and long logit sequences, MTRE remains efficient and
tractable. On MAD-Bench, MM-SafetyBench, MathVista, and four
compositional-geometry benchmarks, MTRE improves AUROC by 9.4 +/- 1.3 points

Abstract: Open-domain dialogue systems aim to generate natural and engaging
conversations, providing significant practical value in real applications such
as social robotics and personal assistants. The advent of large language models
(LLMs) has greatly advanced this field by improving context understanding and
conversational fluency. However, existing LLM-based dialogue systems often fall
short in proactively understanding the user's chatting preferences and guiding
conversations toward user-centered topics. This lack of user-oriented
proactivity can lead users to feel unappreciated, reducing their satisfaction
and willingness to continue the conversation in human-computer interactions. To
address this issue, we propose a User-oriented Proactive Chatbot (UPC) to
enhance the user-oriented proactivity. Specifically, we first construct a
critic to evaluate this proactivity inspired by the LLM-as-a-judge strategy.
Given the scarcity of high-quality training data, we then employ the critic to
guide dialogues between the chatbot and user agents, generating a corpus with
enhanced user-oriented proactivity. To ensure the diversity of the user
backgrounds, we introduce the ISCO-800, a diverse user background dataset for
constructing user agents. Moreover, considering the communication difficulty
varies among users, we propose an iterative curriculum learning method that
trains the chatbot from easy-to-communicate users to more challenging ones,
thereby gradually enhancing its performance. Experiments demonstrate that our
proposed training method is applicable to different LLMs, improving
user-oriented proactivity and attractiveness in open-domain dialogues.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has stimulated interest
in multi-agent collaboration for addressing complex medical tasks. However, the
practical advantages of multi-agent collaboration approaches remain
insufficiently understood. Existing evaluations often lack generalizability,
failing to cover diverse tasks reflective of real-world clinical practice, and
frequently omit rigorous comparisons against both single-LLM-based and
established conventional methods. To address this critical gap, we introduce
MedAgentBoard, a comprehensive benchmark for the systematic evaluation of
multi-agent collaboration, single-LLM, and conventional approaches.
MedAgentBoard encompasses four diverse medical task categories: (1) medical
(visual) question answering, (2) lay summary generation, (3) structured
Electronic Health Record (EHR) predictive modeling, and (4) clinical workflow
automation, across text, medical images, and structured EHR data. Our extensive
experiments reveal a nuanced landscape: while multi-agent collaboration
demonstrates benefits in specific scenarios, such as enhancing task
completeness in clinical workflow automation, it does not consistently
outperform advanced single LLMs (e.g., in textual medical QA) or, critically,
specialized conventional methods that generally maintain better performance in
tasks like medical VQA and EHR-based prediction. MedAgentBoard offers a vital
resource and actionable insights, emphasizing the necessity of a task-specific,
evidence-based approach to selecting and developing AI solutions in medicine.
It underscores that the inherent complexity and overhead of multi-agent
collaboration must be carefully weighed against tangible performance gains. All

Abstract: Recent Large Multimodal Models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities, especially in solving complex mathematical problems and realizing
accurate spatial perception. Our key insight is that these emerging abilities
can naturally extend to robotic manipulation by enabling LMMs to directly infer
the next goal in language via reasoning, rather than relying on a separate
action head. However, this paradigm meets two main challenges: i) How to make
LMMs understand the spatial action space, and ii) How to fully exploit the
reasoning capacity of LMMs in solving these tasks. To tackle the former
challenge, we propose a novel task formulation, which inputs the current states
of object parts and the gripper, and reformulates rotation by a new axis
representation instead of traditional Euler angles. This representation is more
compatible with spatial reasoning and easier to interpret within a unified
language space. For the latter challenge, we design a pipeline to utilize
cutting-edge LMMs to generate a small but high-quality reasoning dataset of
multi-round dialogues that successfully solve manipulation tasks for supervised
fine-tuning. Then, we perform reinforcement learning by trial-and-error
interactions in simulation to further enhance the model's reasoning abilities
for robotic manipulation. Our resulting reasoning model built upon a 7B
backbone, named ReasonManip, demonstrates three notable advantages driven by
its system-2 level reasoning capabilities: i) exceptional generalizability to
out-of-distribution environments, objects, and tasks; ii) inherent sim-to-real
transfer ability enabled by the unified language representation shared across
domains; iii) transparent interpretability connecting high-level reasoning and
low-level control. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed paradigm and its potential to advance LMM-driven robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning is pivotal for Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend
the real world. However, existing works neglect the real-world challenges for
temporal reasoning: (1) intensive temporal information, (2) fast-changing event

levels with 11 fine-grained sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses 3
sub-datasets reflecting different real-world challenges: TIME-Wiki, TIME-News,
and TIME-Dial. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning models and
non-reasoning models. And we conducted an in-depth analysis of temporal
reasoning performance across diverse real-world scenarios and tasks, and
summarized the impact of test-time scaling on temporal reasoning capabilities.
Additionally, we release TIME-Lite, a human-annotated subset to foster future
research and standardized evaluation in temporal reasoning. The code is

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models with symbolic planners is a promising
direction for obtaining verifiable and grounded plans compared to planning in
natural language, with recent works extending this idea to visual domains using
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, rigorous comparison between
VLM-grounded symbolic approaches and methods that plan directly with a VLM has
been hindered by a lack of common environments, evaluation protocols and model
coverage. We introduce ViPlan, the first open-source benchmark for Visual
Planning with symbolic predicates and VLMs. ViPlan features a series of
increasingly challenging tasks in two domains: a visual variant of the classic
Blocksworld planning problem and a simulated household robotics environment. We
benchmark nine open-source VLM families across multiple sizes, along with
selected closed models, evaluating both VLM-grounded symbolic planning and
using the models directly to propose actions. We find symbolic planning to
outperform direct VLM planning in Blocksworld, where accurate image grounding
is crucial, whereas the opposite is true in the household robotics tasks, where
commonsense knowledge and the ability to recover from errors are beneficial.
Finally, we show that across most models and methods, there is no significant
benefit to using Chain-of-Thought prompting, suggesting that current VLMs still
struggle with visual reasoning.

Abstract: Corporate LLMs are gaining traction for efficient knowledge dissemination and

separate LoRA adapters for permissioned datasets, along with the document
embedding they are finetuned on. AC-LoRA retrieves a precise set of LoRA
adapters based on the similarity score with the user query and their
permission. This similarity score is later used to merge the responses if more

routing. We provide an end-to-end prototype of AC-LoRA, evaluate it on two

Result: 在合成数据集和真实MAS应用中，MASLEAK攻击成功率高，平均87%提取系统提示和任务指令，92%提取系统架构。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MAS的知识产权风险，并讨论了潜在防御措施。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the
emergence of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to perform complex tasks through
collaboration. However, the intricate nature of MAS, including their
architecture and agent interactions, raises significant concerns regarding
intellectual property (IP) protection. In this paper, we introduce MASLEAK, a
novel attack framework designed to extract sensitive information from MAS
applications. MASLEAK targets a practical, black-box setting, where the
adversary has no prior knowledge of the MAS architecture or agent
configurations. The adversary can only interact with the MAS through its public
API, submitting attack query $q$ and observing outputs from the final agent.
Inspired by how computer worms propagate and infect vulnerable network hosts,
MASLEAK carefully crafts adversarial query $q$ to elicit, propagate, and retain
responses from each MAS agent that reveal a full set of proprietary components,
including the number of agents, system topology, system prompts, task
instructions, and tool usages. We construct the first synthetic dataset of MAS
applications with 810 applications and also evaluate MASLEAK against real-world
MAS applications, including Coze and CrewAI. MASLEAK achieves high accuracy in
extracting MAS IP, with an average attack success rate of 87% for system
prompts and task instructions, and 92% for system architecture in most cases.
We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and the potential
defenses.

Abstract: The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has led to a new
paradigm in mobile computing--LLM-powered mobile AI agents--capable of
decomposing and automating complex tasks directly on smartphones. However, the
security implications of these agents remain largely unexplored. In this paper,
we present the first comprehensive security analysis of mobile LLM agents,
encompassing three representative categories: System-level AI Agents developed
by original equipment manufacturers (e.g., YOYO Assistant), Third-party
Universal Agents (e.g., Zhipu AI AutoGLM), and Emerging Agent Frameworks (e.g.,
Alibaba Mobile Agent). We begin by analyzing the general workflow of mobile
agents and identifying security threats across three core capability
dimensions: language-based reasoning, GUI-based interaction, and system-level
execution. Our analysis reveals 11 distinct attack surfaces, all rooted in the
unique capabilities and interaction patterns of mobile LLM agents, and spanning
their entire operational lifecycle. To investigate these threats in practice,
we introduce AgentScan, a semi-automated security analysis framework that
systematically evaluates mobile LLM agents across all 11 attack scenarios.
Applying AgentScan to nine widely deployed agents, we uncover a concerning
trend: every agent is vulnerable to targeted attacks. In the most severe cases,
agents exhibit vulnerabilities across eight distinct attack vectors. These
attacks can cause behavioral deviations, privacy leakage, or even full
execution hijacking. Based on these findings, we propose a set of defensive
design principles and practical recommendations for building secure mobile LLM
agents. Our disclosures have received positive feedback from two major device
vendors. Overall, this work highlights the urgent need for standardized
security practices in the fast-evolving landscape of LLM-driven mobile
automation.

Abstract: [Objective] This study focuses on addressing the current lack of a unified
formal theoretical framework in machine learning, as well as the deficiencies
in interpretability and ethical safety assurance. [Methods] A formal
information model is first constructed, utilizing sets of well-formed formulas
to explicitly define the ontological states and carrier mappings of typical
components in machine learning. Learnable and processable predicates, along
with learning and processing functions, are introduced to analyze the logical
deduction and constraint rules of the causal chains within models. [Results] A
meta-framework for machine learning theory (MLT-MF) is established. Based on
this framework, universal definitions for model interpretability and ethical
safety are proposed. Furthermore, three key theorems are proved: the
equivalence of model interpretability and information recoverability, the
assurance of ethical safety, and the estimation of generalization error.
[Limitations] The current framework assumes ideal conditions with noiseless
information-enabling mappings and primarily targets model learning and
processing logic in static scenarios. It does not yet address information
fusion and conflict resolution across ontological spaces in multimodal or
multi-agent systems. [Conclusions] This work overcomes the limitations of
fragmented research and provides a unified theoretical foundation for

Abstract: Following instructions in real-world conditions requires the ability to adapt

difficult to assess agent performance in more diverse and challenging settings.

instruction following in a multimodal environment with diverse instructions and
dynamic interactions. CrafText includes 3,924 instructions with 3,423 unique

Abstract: Despite their ability to understand chemical knowledge and accurately
generate sequential representations, large language models (LLMs) remain
limited in their capacity to propose novel molecules with drug-like properties.
In addition, the molecules that LLMs propose can often be challenging to make
in the lab. To more effectively enable the discovery of functional small
molecules, LLMs need to learn a molecular language. However, LLMs are currently
limited by encoding molecules from atoms. In this paper, we argue that just
like tokenizing texts into (sub-)word tokens instead of characters, molecules
should be decomposed and reassembled at the level of functional building
blocks, i.e., parts of molecules that bring unique functions and serve as
effective building blocks for real-world automated laboratory synthesis. This
motivates us to propose mCLM, a modular Chemical-Language Model tokenizing
molecules into building blocks and learning a bilingual language model of both
natural language descriptions of functions and molecule building blocks. By
reasoning on such functional building blocks, mCLM guarantees to generate
efficiently synthesizable molecules thanks to recent progress in block-based
chemistry, while also improving the functions of molecules in a principled
manner. In experiments on 430 FDA-approved drugs, we find mCLM capable of
significantly improving 5 out of 6 chemical functions critical to determining
drug potentials. More importantly, mCLM can reason on multiple functions and
improve the FDA-rejected drugs (``fallen angels'') over multiple iterations to
greatly improve their shortcomings.

Abstract: Understanding multiparty conversations demands robust Theory of Mind (ToM)
capabilities, including the ability to track dynamic information, manage
knowledge asymmetries, and distinguish relevant information across extended
exchanges. To advance ToM evaluation in such settings, we present a carefully
designed scalable methodology for generating high-quality benchmark
conversation-question pairs with these characteristics. Using this methodology,
we create $\texttt{DIAMONDs}$, a new conversational QA dataset covering common
business, financial or other group interactions. In these goal-oriented
conversations, participants often have to track certain numerical quantities
(say $\textit{expected profit}$) of interest that can be derived from other
variable quantities (like $\textit{marketing expenses, expected sales,
salary}$, etc.), whose values also change over the course of the conversation.
$\texttt{DIAMONDs}$ questions pose simple numerical reasoning problems over
such quantities of interest (e.g., $\textit{funds required for charity events,
expected company profit next quarter}$, etc.) in the context of the information
exchanged in conversations. This allows for precisely evaluating ToM
capabilities for carefully tracking and reasoning over participants' knowledge
states.
  Our evaluation of state-of-the-art language models reveals significant
challenges in handling participant-centric reasoning, specifically in
situations where participants have false beliefs. Models also struggle with
conversations containing distractors and show limited ability to identify
scenarios with insufficient information. These findings highlight current
models' ToM limitations in handling real-world multi-party conversations.

Result: 在10个任务中验证了框架的有效性，例如在Direct Arylation任务中将收率从25.2%提升至60.7%。小规模LLMs通过强化学习微调也能达到类似效果。

Conclusion: Reasoning BO展示了LLMs在优化场景中的强大推理能力，为自动化科学实验提供了高效且计算可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Many real-world scientific and industrial applications require the
optimization of expensive black-box functions. Bayesian Optimization (BO)
provides an effective framework for such problems. However, traditional BO
methods are prone to get trapped in local optima and often lack interpretable
insights. To address this issue, this paper designs Reasoning BO, a novel
framework that leverages reasoning models to guide the sampling process in BO
while incorporating multi-agent systems and knowledge graphs for online
knowledge accumulation. By integrating the reasoning and contextual
understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we can provide
strong guidance to enhance the BO process. As the optimization progresses,
Reasoning BO provides real-time sampling recommendations along with critical
insights grounded in plausible scientific theories, aiding in the discovery of
superior solutions within the search space. We systematically evaluate our
approach across 10 diverse tasks encompassing synthetic mathematical functions
and complex real-world applications. The framework demonstrates its capability
to progressively refine sampling strategies through real-time insights and
hypothesis evolution, effectively identifying higher-performing regions of the
search space for focused exploration. This process highlights the powerful
reasoning and context-learning abilities of LLMs in optimization scenarios. For
example, in the Direct Arylation task, our method increased the yield to 60.7%,
whereas traditional BO achieved only a 25.2% yield. Furthermore, our
investigation reveals that smaller LLMs, when fine-tuned through reinforcement
learning, can attain comparable performance to their larger counterparts. This
enhanced reasoning capability paves the way for more efficient automated
scientific experimentation while maintaining computational feasibility.

Conclusion: PDDLego+为部分可观测环境提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案，且其捕获的知识具有可解释性和迁移性。

Abstract: In planning, using LLMs not to predict plans but to formalize an environment
into the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) has been shown to greatly
improve performance and control. While most work focused on fully observable
environments, we tackle the more realistic and challenging partially observable
environments where existing methods are incapacitated by the lack of complete
information. We propose PDDLego+, a framework to iteratively formalize, plan,
grow, and refine PDDL representations in a zero-shot manner, without needing
access to any existing trajectories. On two textual simulated environments, we
show that PDDLego+ not only achieves superior performance, but also shows
robustness against problem complexity. We also show that the domain knowledge
captured after a successful trial is interpretable and benefits future tasks.

TL;DR: PoLO是一个统一框架，通过链式水印同时实现训练验证（PoL）和所有权证明（PoO），提高效率并保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型被共享和外包，需要验证训练努力（PoL）和所有权（PoO）以确保性能声明和交易安全。现有方法分开处理这些问题，导致保护不足和验证开销高。

Method: PoLO将训练过程分为细粒度训练片段，每个片段嵌入基于前一片段哈希的专用水印，形成链式结构。完整水印集作为PoL，最终水印作为PoO。

Result: PoLO在所有权验证中达到99%的水印检测准确率，验证成本仅为传统方法的1.5-10%，且伪造需1.1-4倍资源。

Conclusion: PoLO高效、隐私保护且安全，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly shared and outsourced, raising
requirements of verifying training effort (Proof-of-Learning, PoL) to ensure
claimed performance and establishing ownership (Proof-of-Ownership, PoO) for
transactions. When models are trained by untrusted parties, PoL and PoO must be
enforced together to enable protection, attribution, and compensation. However,
existing studies typically address them separately, which not only weakens
protection against forgery and privacy breaches but also leads to high
verification overhead.
  We propose PoLO, a unified framework that simultaneously achieves PoL and PoO
using chained watermarks. PoLO splits the training process into fine-grained
training shards and embeds a dedicated watermark in each shard. Each watermark
is generated using the hash of the preceding shard, certifying the training
process of the preceding shard. The chained structure makes it computationally
difficult to forge any individual part of the whole training process. The
complete set of watermarks serves as the PoL, while the final watermark
provides the PoO. PoLO offers more efficient and privacy-preserving
verification compared to the vanilla PoL solutions that rely on gradient-based
trajectory tracing and inadvertently expose training data during verification,
while maintaining the same level of ownership assurance of watermark-based PoO
schemes. Our evaluation shows that PoLO achieves 99% watermark detection
accuracy for ownership verification, while preserving data privacy and cutting
verification costs to just 1.5-10% of traditional methods. Forging PoLO demands
1.1-4x more resources than honest proof generation, with the original proof
retaining over 90% detection accuracy even after attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for
automated unit test generation. We introduce a hybrid framework called EvoGPT
that integrates LLM-based test generation with evolutionary search techniques
to create diverse, fault-revealing unit tests. Unit tests are initially
generated with diverse temperature sampling to maximize behavioral and test
suite diversity, followed by a generation-repair loop and coverage-guided
assertion enhancement. The resulting test suites are evolved using genetic
algorithms, guided by a fitness function prioritizing mutation score over
traditional coverage metrics. This design emphasizes the primary objective of
unit testing-fault detection. Evaluated on multiple open-source Java projects,
EvoGPT achieves an average improvement of 10% in both code coverage and
mutation score compared to LLMs and traditional search-based software testing
baselines. These results demonstrate that combining LLM-driven diversity,
targeted repair, and evolutionary optimization produces more effective and
resilient test suites.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for addressing
complex, distributed tasks in large language model (LLM)-driven applications.
While prior research has focused on high-level architectural frameworks, the
granular mechanisms governing agents, critical to performance and scalability,
remain underexplored. This study systematically investigates four dimensions of
collaboration strategies: (1) agent governance, (2) participation control, (3)
interaction dynamics, and (4) dialogue history management. Through rigorous
experimentation under two context-dependent scenarios: Distributed Evidence
Integration (DEI) and Structured Evidence Synthesis (SES), we quantify the
impact of these strategies on both task accuracy and computational efficiency.
Our findings reveal that centralized governance, instructor-led participation,
ordered interaction patterns, and instructor-curated context summarization
collectively optimize the trade-off between decision quality and resource
utilization with the support of the proposed Token-Accuracy Ratio (TAR). This
work establishes a foundation for designing adaptive, scalable multi-agent
systems, shifting the focus from structural novelty to strategic interaction
mechanics.

information in LLMs for repository-level code completion scenarios, we propose
a data processing method based on a Structure-Preserving and

Abstract: Autonomous browsing agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used to automate web-based tasks. However, their reliance on

attack surface. This paper presents a comprehensive security evaluation of such
agents, focusing on systemic vulnerabilities across multiple architectural

and provides actionable guidance for securing their deployment in real-world
environments. To address discovered threats, we propose a defense in depth
strategy incorporating input sanitization, planner executor isolation, formal
analyzers, and session safeguards. These measures protect against both initial
access and post exploitation attack vectors. Through a white box analysis of a
popular open source project, Browser Use, we demonstrate how untrusted web
content can hijack agent behavior and lead to critical security breaches. Our
findings include prompt injection, domain validation bypass, and credential

Conclusion: 通过结合合作博弈论和保形预测，为高风险机器学习应用提供了一个严谨且灵活的工具包。

Abstract: Cooperative game theory methods, notably Shapley values, have significantly
enhanced machine learning (ML) interpretability. However, existing explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks mainly attribute average model predictions, overlooking
predictive uncertainty. This work addresses that gap by proposing a novel,
model-agnostic uncertainty attribution (UA) method grounded in conformal
prediction (CP). By defining cooperative games where CP interval
properties-such as width and bounds-serve as value functions, we systematically
attribute predictive uncertainty to input features. Extending beyond the
traditional Shapley values, we use the richer class of Harsanyi allocations,
and in particular the proportional Shapley values, which distribute attribution
proportionally to feature importance. We propose a Monte Carlo approximation
method with robust statistical guarantees to address computational feasibility,
significantly improving runtime efficiency. Our comprehensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate the practical utility
and interpretative depth of our approach. By combining cooperative game theory
and conformal prediction, we offer a rigorous, flexible toolkit for
understanding and communicating predictive uncertainty in high-stakes ML
applications.

Result: 7B参数模型在3k样本下，在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上达到47.3%准确率，优于更大的UI-TARS-72B模型。

Conclusion: RL方法能显著提升GUI代理在复杂环境中的性能。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made substantial strides in
understanding and executing user instructions across diverse platforms. Yet,
grounding these instructions to precise interface elements remains challenging,
especially in complex, high-resolution, professional environments. Traditional
supervised finetuning (SFT) methods often require large volumes of diverse data
and exhibit weak generalization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework that incorporates three core
strategies: (1) seed data curation to ensure high quality training samples, (2)
a dense policy gradient that provides continuous feedback based on prediction
accuracy, and (3) a self evolutionary reinforcement finetuning mechanism that
iteratively refines the model using attention maps. With only 3k training
samples, our 7B-parameter model achieves state-of-the-art results among
similarly sized models on three grounding benchmarks. Notably, it attains
47.3\% accuracy on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset, outperforming much larger
models, such as UI-TARS-72B, by a margin of 24.2\%. These findings underscore
the effectiveness of RL-based approaches in enhancing GUI agent performance,

Conclusion: 自监督训练数据有望进一步提升视觉语言模型在GUI代理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Training effective Vision Language Models (VLMs) for GUI agents typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over large-scale annotated datasets,
where the collection process is labor-intensive and error-prone. In this work,
we propose a self-supervised inverse dynamics task to enable VLMs to learn from
GUI transition pairs by inferring the action that caused that transition. This
training task offers two advantages: (1) It enables VLMs to ignore variations
unrelated to user actions (e.g., background refreshes, ads) and to focus on
true affordances such as buttons and input fields within complex GUIs. (2) The
training data can be easily obtained from existing GUI trajectories without
requiring human annotation, and it can be easily scaled through automatic
offline exploration. Using this training task, we propose UI-shift, a framework
for enhancing VLM-based GUI agents through self-supervised reinforcement
learning (RL). With only 2K training samples sourced from existing datasets,
two VLMs -- Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B -- trained with UI-Shift achieve
competitive or superior performance on grounding tasks (ScreenSpot-series
benchmarks) and GUI automation tasks (AndroidControl), compared to SFT
baselines and GUI-specific models that explicitly elicit reasoning abilities
during RL. Our findings suggest a potential direction for enhancing VLMs for
GUI agents by leveraging more self-supervised training data in the future.

Motivation: 探讨LLM是否真正理解数学结构，而不仅仅是语法正确性，通过数学不等式这一基础工具进行验证。

Method: 引入Ineq-Comp基准，通过系统化变换（如变量复制、代数重写和多步组合）构建问题，测试多个证明系统的表现。

Result: 大多数证明系统（如Goedel、STP、Kimina-7B）表现不佳，DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B相对稳健但仍下降20%。即使提供上下文证明，组合推理能力仍不足。

Conclusion: 当前AI证明系统在组合推理上与人类数学直觉存在明显差距。

Abstract: LLM-based formal proof assistants (e.g., in Lean) hold great promise for
automating mathematical discovery. But beyond syntactic correctness, do these
systems truly understand mathematical structure as humans do? We investigate
this question through the lens of mathematical inequalities -- a fundamental
tool across many domains. While modern provers can solve basic inequalities, we
probe their ability to handle human-intuitive compositionality. We introduce
Ineq-Comp, a benchmark built from elementary inequalities through systematic
transformations, including variable duplication, algebraic rewriting, and
multi-step composition. Although these problems remain easy for humans, we find
that most provers -- including Goedel, STP, and Kimina-7B -- struggle
significantly. DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B shows relative robustness -- possibly
because it is trained to decompose the problems into sub-problems -- but still
suffers a 20\% performance drop (pass@32). Strikingly, performance remains poor
for all models even when formal proofs of the constituent parts are provided in
context, revealing that the source of weakness is indeed in compositional
reasoning. Our results expose a persisting gap between the generalization
behavior of current AI provers and human mathematical intuition.

Abstract: Early cavemen relied on gestures, vocalizations, and simple signals to
coordinate, plan, avoid predators, and share resources. Today, humans
collaborate using complex languages to achieve remarkable results. What drives
this evolution in communication? How does language emerge, adapt, and become
vital for teamwork? Understanding the origins of language remains a challenge.
A leading hypothesis in linguistics and anthropology posits that language
evolved to meet the ecological and social demands of early human cooperation.
Language did not arise in isolation, but through shared survival goals.
Inspired by this view, we investigate the emergence of language in multi-agent
Foraging Games. These environments are designed to reflect the cognitive and
ecological constraints believed to have influenced the evolution of
communication. Agents operate in a shared grid world with only partial
knowledge about other agents and the environment, and must coordinate to
complete games like picking up high-value targets or executing temporally
ordered actions. Using end-to-end deep reinforcement learning, agents learn
both actions and communication strategies from scratch. We find that agents
develop communication protocols with hallmark features of natural language:
arbitrariness, interchangeability, displacement, cultural transmission, and
compositionality. We quantify each property and analyze how different factors,
such as population size and temporal dependencies, shape specific aspects of
the emergent language. Our framework serves as a platform for studying how
language can evolve from partial observability, temporal reasoning, and
cooperative goals in embodied multi-agent settings. We will release all data,
code, and models publicly.

Abstract: Recent work investigated the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the
synthesis of heuristic guidance to improve the performance of temporal planners
when a domain is fixed and a set of training problems (not plans) is given. The
idea is to extract a heuristic from the value function of a particular
(possibly infinite-state) MDP constructed over the training problems.
  In this paper, we propose an evolution of this learning and planning
framework that focuses on exploiting the information provided by symbolic
heuristics during both the RL and planning phases. First, we formalize
different reward schemata for the synthesis and use symbolic heuristics to
mitigate the problems caused by the truncation of episodes needed to deal with
the potentially infinite MDP. Second, we propose learning a residual of an
existing symbolic heuristic, which is a "correction" of the heuristic value,
instead of eagerly learning the whole heuristic from scratch. Finally, we use
the learned heuristic in combination with a symbolic heuristic using a
multiple-queue planning approach to balance systematic search with imperfect
learned information. We experimentally compare all the approaches, highlighting
their strengths and weaknesses and significantly advancing the state of the art
for this planning and learning schema.

Conclusion: AutoMathKG为数学知识图谱的自动构建和更新提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: A mathematical knowledge graph (KG) presents knowledge within the field of
mathematics in a structured manner. Constructing a math KG using natural
language is an essential but challenging task. There are two major limitations
of existing works: first, they are constrained by corpus completeness, often
discarding or manually supplementing incomplete knowledge; second, they
typically fail to fully automate the integration of diverse knowledge sources.
This paper proposes AutoMathKG, a high-quality, wide-coverage, and
multi-dimensional math KG capable of automatic updates. AutoMathKG regards
mathematics as a vast directed graph composed of Definition, Theorem, and
Problem entities, with their reference relationships as edges. It integrates
knowledge from ProofWiki, textbooks, arXiv papers, and TheoremQA, enhancing
entities and relationships with large language models (LLMs) via in-context
learning for data augmentation. To search for similar entities, MathVD, a
vector database, is built through two designed embedding strategies using
SBERT. To automatically update, two mechanisms are proposed. For knowledge
completion mechanism, Math LLM is developed to interact with AutoMathKG,
providing missing proofs or solutions. For knowledge fusion mechanism, MathVD
is used to retrieve similar entities, and LLM is used to determine whether to
merge with a candidate or add as a new entity. A wide range of experiments
demonstrate the advanced performance and broad applicability of the AutoMathKG
system, including superior reachability query results in MathVD compared to
five baselines and robust mathematical reasoning capability in Math LLM.

Motivation: 随着AI系统从静态工具发展为动态代理，传统的基于固定风险层级的治理框架已不足以应对新兴挑战。

Method: 提出维度治理框架，通过动态追踪3A（决策权、过程自主性和问责制）的分布，实现预适应性调整。

Result: 该框架能够显式监控系统行为，预判风险，并为动态分类提供基础。

Conclusion: 维度治理为AI治理提供了更具弹性和前瞻性的路径，同时保留了分类的必要性。

Abstract: As AI systems evolve from static tools to dynamic agents, traditional
categorical governance frameworks -- based on fixed risk tiers, levels of
autonomy, or human oversight models -- are increasingly insufficient on their
own. Systems built on foundation models, self-supervised learning, and
multi-agent architectures increasingly blur the boundaries that categories were
designed to police. In this Perspective, we make the case for dimensional
governance: a framework that tracks how decision authority, process autonomy,
and accountability (the 3As) distribute dynamically across human-AI
relationships. A critical advantage of this approach is its ability to
explicitly monitor system movement toward and across key governance thresholds,
enabling preemptive adjustments before risks materialize. This dimensional
approach provides the necessary foundation for more adaptive categorization,
enabling thresholds and classifications that can evolve with emerging
capabilities. While categories remain essential for decision-making, building
them upon dimensional foundations allows for context-specific adaptability and
stakeholder-responsive governance that static approaches cannot achieve. We
outline key dimensions, critical trust thresholds, and practical examples
illustrating where rigid categorical frameworks fail -- and where a dimensional
mindset could offer a more resilient and future-proof path forward for both
governance and innovation at the frontier of artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems leverage advanced AI models as autonomous agents that
interact, cooperate, or compete to complete complex tasks across applications
such as robotics and traffic management. Despite their growing importance,
safety in multi-agent systems remains largely underexplored, with most research
focusing on single AI models rather than interacting agents. This work
investigates backdoor vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems and proposes a
defense mechanism based on agent interactions. By leveraging reasoning
abilities, each agent evaluates responses from others to detect illogical
reasoning processes, which indicate poisoned agents. Experiments on LLM-based
multi-agent systems, including ChatGPT series and Llama 3, demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving high accuracy in identifying
poisoned agents while minimizing false positives on clean agents. We believe
this work provides insights into multi-agent system safety and contributes to
the development of robust, trustworthy AI interactions.

Conclusion: RoboFAC框架有效处理机器人失败并帮助VLA模型恢复。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently advanced robotic
manipulation by translating natural-language instructions and image information
into sequential control actions. However, these models often underperform in
open-world scenarios, as they are predominantly trained on successful expert
demonstrations and exhibit a limited capacity for failure recovery. In this
work, we present a Robotic Failure Analysis and Correction (RoboFAC) framework
to address this issue. Firstly, we construct RoboFAC dataset comprising 9,440
erroneous manipulation trajectories and 78,623 QA pairs across 16 diverse tasks
and 53 scenes in both simulation and real-world environments. Leveraging our
dataset, we develop RoboFAC model, which is capable of Task Understanding,
Failure Analysis and Failure Correction. Experimental results demonstrate that
the RoboFAC model outperforms GPT-4o by 34.1% on our evaluation benchmark.
Furthermore, we integrate the RoboFAC model into a real-world VLA control
pipeline as an external supervision providing correction instructions, yielding
a 29.1% relative improvement on average on four real-world tasks. The results
show that our RoboFAC framework effectively handles robotic failures and
assists the VLA model in recovering from failures.

Abstract: Protecting cyber Intellectual Property (IP) such as web content is an
increasingly critical concern. The rise of large language models (LLMs) with
online retrieval capabilities presents a double-edged sword that enables
convenient access to information but often undermines the rights of original
content creators. As users increasingly rely on LLM-generated responses, they
gradually diminish direct engagement with original information sources,
significantly reducing the incentives for IP creators to contribute, and
leading to a saturating cyberspace with more AI-generated content. In response,
we propose a novel defense framework that empowers web content creators to
safeguard their web-based IP from unauthorized LLM real-time extraction by
leveraging the semantic understanding capability of LLMs themselves. Our method
follows principled motivations and effectively addresses an intractable
black-box optimization problem. Real-world experiments demonstrated that our
methods improve defense success rates from 2.5% to 88.6% on different LLMs,
outperforming traditional defenses such as configuration-based restrictions.

Abstract: Competitive programming benchmarks are widely used in scenarios such as
programming contests and large language model assessments. However, the growing
presence of duplicate or highly similar problems raises concerns not only about
competition fairness, but also about the validity of competitive programming as
a benchmark for model evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new problem --
similar question retrieval -- to address this issue. Due to the lack of both
data and models, solving this problem is challenging. To this end, we introduce
CPRet, a retrieval-oriented benchmark suite for competitive programming,
covering four retrieval tasks: two code-centric (i.e., Text-to-Code and
Code-to-Code) and two newly proposed problem-centric tasks (i.e.,
Problem-to-Duplicate and Simplified-to-Full), built from a combination of
automatically crawled problem-solution data and manually curated annotations.
Our contribution includes both high-quality training data and temporally
separated test sets for reliable evaluation. In addition, we develop two
task-specialized retrievers based on this dataset: CPRetriever-Code, trained
with a novel Group-InfoNCE loss for problem-code alignment, and
CPRetriever-Prob, fine-tuned for identifying problem-level similarity. Both
models achieve strong results and are open-sourced for local use. Finally, we
analyze LiveCodeBench and find that high-similarity problems inflate model pass
rates and reduce differentiation, underscoring the need for similarity-aware
evaluation in future benchmarks.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty in text-to-image diffusion models is challenging
because of their large parameter counts (often exceeding 100 million) and
operation in complex, high-dimensional spaces with virtually infinite input
possibilities. In this paper, we propose Epistemic Mixture of Experts (EMoE), a
novel framework for efficiently estimating epistemic uncertainty in diffusion
models. EMoE leverages pre-trained networks without requiring additional
training, enabling direct uncertainty estimation from a prompt. We leverage a
latent space within the diffusion process that captures epistemic uncertainty
better than existing methods. Experimental results on the COCO dataset
demonstrate EMoE's effectiveness, showing a strong correlation between
uncertainty and image quality. Additionally, EMoE identifies under-sampled
languages and regions with higher uncertainty, revealing hidden biases in the
training set. This capability demonstrates the relevance of EMoE as a tool for
addressing fairness and accountability in AI-generated content.

Abstract: Psychiatric disorders affect millions globally, yet their diagnosis faces
significant challenges in clinical practice due to subjective assessments and
accessibility concerns, leading to potential delays in treatment. To help
address this issue, we present Heart2Mind, a human-centered contestable
psychiatric disorder diagnosis system using wearable electrocardiogram (ECG)
monitors. Our approach leverages cardiac biomarkers, particularly heart rate
variability (HRV) and R-R intervals (RRI) time series, as objective indicators
of autonomic dysfunction in psychiatric conditions. The system comprises three
key components: (1) a Cardiac Monitoring Interface (CMI) for real-time data
acquisition from Polar H9/H10 devices; (2) a Multi-Scale Temporal-Frequency
Transformer (MSTFT) that processes RRI time series through integrated
time-frequency domain analysis; (3) a Contestable Diagnosis Interface (CDI)
combining Self-Adversarial Explanations (SAEs) with contestable Large Language
Models (LLMs). Our MSTFT achieves 91.7% accuracy on the HRV-ACC dataset using
leave-one-out cross-validation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. SAEs
successfully detect inconsistencies in model predictions by comparing
attention-based and gradient-based explanations, while LLMs enable clinicians
to validate correct predictions and contest erroneous ones. This work
demonstrates the feasibility of combining wearable technology with Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and contestable LLMs to create a transparent,
contestable system for psychiatric diagnosis that maintains clinical oversight
while leveraging advanced AI capabilities. Our implementation is publicly

Conclusion: cDGMs为高维POMDPs提供了一种有效的信念表示方法。

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are used to model a
wide range of applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and
subsurface problems. However, accurately representing the belief is difficult
for POMDPs with high-dimensional states. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that uses conditional deep generative models (cDGMs) to represent the
belief. Unlike traditional belief representations, cDGMs are well-suited for
high-dimensional states and large numbers of observations, and they can
generate an arbitrary number of samples from the posterior belief. We train the
cDGMs on data produced by random rollout trajectories and show their
effectiveness in solving a mineral exploration POMDP with a large and
continuous state space. The cDGMs outperform particle filter baselines in both
task-agnostic measures of belief accuracy as well as in planning performance.

Conclusion: EMM框架能有效减少认知负担，并提供了将其应用于临床的关键技术考虑。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) tools for radiology are commonly unmonitored
once deployed. The lack of real-time case-by-case assessments of AI prediction
confidence requires users to independently distinguish between trustworthy and
unreliable AI predictions, which increases cognitive burden, reduces
productivity, and potentially leads to misdiagnoses. To address these
challenges, we introduce Ensembled Monitoring Model (EMM), a framework inspired
by clinical consensus practices using multiple expert reviews. Designed
specifically for black-box commercial AI products, EMM operates independently
without requiring access to internal AI components or intermediate outputs,
while still providing robust confidence measurements. Using intracranial
hemorrhage detection as our test case on a large, diverse dataset of 2919
studies, we demonstrate that EMM successfully categorizes confidence in the
AI-generated prediction, suggesting different actions and helping improve the
overall performance of AI tools to ultimately reduce cognitive burden.
Importantly, we provide key technical considerations and best practices for
successfully translating EMM into clinical settings.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become an effective paradigm for managing
real-world facts, which are not only complex but also dynamically evolve over
time. The temporal validity of facts often serves as a strong clue in
downstream link prediction tasks, which predicts a missing element in a fact.
Traditional link prediction techniques on temporal KGs either consider a
sequence of temporal snapshots of KGs with an ad-hoc defined time interval or
expand a temporal fact over its validity period under a predefined time
granularity; these approaches not only suffer from the sensitivity of the
selection of time interval/granularity, but also face the computational
challenges when handling facts with long (even infinite) validity. Although the
recent hyper-relational KGs represent the temporal validity of a fact as
qualifiers describing the fact, it is still suboptimal due to its ignorance of
the infinite validity of some facts and the insufficient information encoded
from the qualifiers about the temporal validity. Against this background, we
propose VITA, a $\underline{V}$ersatile t$\underline{I}$me
represen$\underline{TA}$tion learning method for temporal hyper-relational
knowledge graphs. We first propose a versatile time representation that can
flexibly accommodate all four types of temporal validity of facts (i.e., since,
until, period, time-invariant), and then design VITA to effectively learn the
time information in both aspects of time value and timespan to boost the link
prediction performance. We conduct a thorough evaluation of VITA compared to a
sizable collection of baselines on real-world KG datasets. Results show that
VITA outperforms the best-performing baselines in various link prediction tasks
(predicting missing entities, relations, time, and other numeric literals) by
up to 75.3%. Ablation studies and a case study also support our key design
choices.

Abstract: AI-driven models have shown great promise in detecting errors in radiology
reports, yet the field lacks a unified benchmark for rigorous evaluation of
error detection and further correction. To address this gap, we introduce
CorBenchX, a comprehensive suite for automated error detection and correction
in chest X-ray reports, designed to advance AI-assisted quality control in
clinical practice. We first synthesize a large-scale dataset of 26,326 chest
X-ray error reports by injecting clinically common errors via prompting
DeepSeek-R1, with each corrupted report paired with its original text, error
type, and human-readable description. Leveraging this dataset, we benchmark
both open- and closed-source vision-language models,(e.g., InternVL, Qwen-VL,
GPT-4o, o4-mini, and Claude-3.7) for error detection and correction under
zero-shot prompting. Among these models, o4-mini achieves the best performance,
with 50.6 % detection accuracy and correction scores of BLEU 0.853, ROUGE
0.924, BERTScore 0.981, SembScore 0.865, and CheXbertF1 0.954, remaining below
clinical-level accuracy, highlighting the challenge of precise report
correction. To advance the state of the art, we propose a multi-step
reinforcement learning (MSRL) framework that optimizes a multi-objective reward
combining format compliance, error-type accuracy, and BLEU similarity. We apply
MSRL to QwenVL2.5-7B, the top open-source model in our benchmark, achieving an
improvement of 38.3% in single-error detection precision and 5.2% in
single-error correction over the zero-shot baseline.

Conclusion: 控制信息传播和利用结构化概率建模对KGC至关重要，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) serve as fundamental structures for organizing
interconnected data across diverse domains. However, most KGs remain
incomplete, limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications. Knowledge
graph completion (KGC) aims to address this issue by inferring missing links,
but existing methods face critical challenges: deep graph neural networks
(GNNs) suffer from over-smoothing, while embedding-based models fail to capture
abstract relational features. This study aims to overcome these limitations by
proposing a unified framework that integrates GNN distillation and abstract
probabilistic interaction modeling (APIM). GNN distillation approach introduces
an iterative message-feature filtering process to mitigate over-smoothing,
preserving the discriminative power of node representations. APIM module
complements this by learning structured, abstract interaction patterns through
probabilistic signatures and transition matrices, allowing for a richer, more
flexible representation of entity and relation interactions. We apply these
methods to GNN-based models and the APIM to embedding-based KGC models,
conducting extensive evaluations on the widely used WN18RR and FB15K-237
datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over baseline
models, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The findings
highlight the importance of both controlling information propagation and
leveraging structured probabilistic modeling, offering new avenues for

Abstract: Rule mining in knowledge graphs enables interpretable link prediction.
However, deep learning-based rule mining methods face significant memory and

sampling less than 1% of facts on a single CPU in 22 seconds, while preserving
interpretability and boosting inference accuracy by up to 11% over baselines.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that human emotions exhibit a high-dimensional,
complex structure. A full capturing of this complexity requires new approaches,
as conventional models that disregard high dimensionality risk overlooking key
nuances of human emotions. Here, we examined the extent to which the latest
generation of rapidly evolving Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capture
these high-dimensional, intricate emotion structures, including capabilities
and limitations. Specifically, we compared self-reported emotion ratings from
participants watching videos with model-generated estimates (e.g., Gemini or
GPT). We evaluated performance not only at the individual video level but also
from emotion structures that account for inter-video relationships. At the
level of simple correlation between emotion structures, our results
demonstrated strong similarity between human and model-inferred emotion
structures. To further explore whether the similarity between humans and models
is at the signle item level or the coarse-categorical level, we applied Gromov
Wasserstein Optimal Transport. We found that although performance was not
necessarily high at the strict, single-item level, performance across video
categories that elicit similar emotions was substantial, indicating that the
model could infer human emotional experiences at the category level. Our
results suggest that current state-of-the-art MLLMs broadly capture the complex
high-dimensional emotion structures at the category level, as well as their
apparent limitations in accurately capturing entire structures at the
single-item level.

Conclusion: MT-Path为N-TKG推理提供了一种高效且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which utilize quadruples in the form of
(subject, predicate, object, timestamp) to describe temporal facts, have
attracted extensive attention. N-tuple TKGs (N-TKGs) further extend traditional
TKGs by utilizing n-tuples to incorporate auxiliary elements alongside core
elements (i.e., subject, predicate, and object) of facts, so as to represent
them in a more fine-grained manner. Reasoning over N-TKGs aims to predict
potential future facts based on historical ones. However, existing N-TKG
reasoning methods often lack explainability due to their black-box nature.
Therefore, we introduce a new Reinforcement Learning-based method, named
MT-Path, which leverages the temporal information to traverse historical
n-tuples and construct a temporal reasoning path. Specifically, in order to
integrate the information encapsulated within n-tuples, i.e., the
entity-irrelevant information within the predicate, the information about core
elements, and the complete information about the entire n-tuples, MT-Path
utilizes a mixture policy-driven action selector, which bases on three
low-level policies, namely, the predicate-focused policy, the
core-element-focused policy and the whole-fact-focused policy. Further, MT-Path
utilizes an auxiliary element-aware GCN to capture the rich semantic
dependencies among facts, thereby enabling the agent to gain a deep
understanding of each n-tuple. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and the explainability of MT-Path.

Additionally, we synthesize and release the largest computer use grounding

decoupling of tasks. Our multi-scale models trained on Jedi demonstrate its

ScreenSpot-Pro, and our OSWorld-G. Furthermore, we demonstrate that improved

Abstract: Scientific discovery is driven by the iterative process of background
research, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and data analysis. Despite
recent advancements in applying artificial intelligence to scientific
discovery, no system has yet automated all of these stages in a single
workflow. Here, we introduce Robin, the first multi-agent system capable of
fully automating the key intellectual steps of the scientific process. By
integrating literature search agents with data analysis agents, Robin can
generate hypotheses, propose experiments, interpret experimental results, and
generate updated hypotheses, achieving a semi-autonomous approach to scientific
discovery. By applying this system, we were able to identify a novel treatment
for dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD), the major cause of blindness
in the developed world. Robin proposed enhancing retinal pigment epithelium
phagocytosis as a therapeutic strategy, and identified and validated a
promising therapeutic candidate, ripasudil. Ripasudil is a clinically-used rho
kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that has never previously been proposed for treating
dAMD. To elucidate the mechanism of ripasudil-induced upregulation of
phagocytosis, Robin then proposed and analyzed a follow-up RNA-seq experiment,
which revealed upregulation of ABCA1, a critical lipid efflux pump and possible
novel target. All hypotheses, experimental plans, data analyses, and data
figures in the main text of this report were produced by Robin. As the first AI
system to autonomously discover and validate a novel therapeutic candidate
within an iterative lab-in-the-loop framework, Robin establishes a new paradigm

Result: 在LIBERO-LONG基准测试中策略性能提升27.9%，在真实场景中提升20%，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LaDi-WM通过潜在空间预测显著提升了机器人策略性能，并具有较高的泛化性。

Abstract: Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the
Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance
by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual
states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known
challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations.
To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space
of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the
well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models
(VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic
features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent
space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting
pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that
iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby
generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both

Abstract: The data landscape is rich with structured data, often of high value to
organizations, driving important applications in data analysis and machine
learning. Recent progress in representation learning and generative models for
such data has led to the development of natural language interfaces to
structured data, including those leveraging text-to-SQL. Contextualizing
interactions, either through conversational interfaces or agentic components,
in structured data through retrieval-augmented generation can provide
substantial benefits in the form of freshness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness
of answers. The key question is: how do we retrieve the right table(s) for the
analytical query or task at hand? To this end, we introduce TARGET: a benchmark
for evaluating TAble Retrieval for GEnerative Tasks. With TARGET we analyze the
retrieval performance of different retrievers in isolation, as well as their
impact on downstream tasks. We find that dense embedding-based retrievers far
outperform a BM25 baseline which is less effective than it is for retrieval
over unstructured text. We also surface the sensitivity of retrievers across
various metadata (e.g., missing table titles), and demonstrate a stark
variation of retrieval performance across datasets and tasks. TARGET is

Abstract: Neural networks are powerful tools for data-driven modeling of complex
dynamical systems, enhancing predictive capability for control applications.
However, their inherent nonlinearity and black-box nature challenge control
designs that prioritize rigorous safety and recursive feasibility guarantees.
This paper presents algorithmic methods for synthesizing control invariant sets
specifically tailored to neural network based dynamical models. These
algorithms employ set recursion, ensuring termination after a finite number of
iterations and generating subsets in which closed-loop dynamics are forward
invariant, thus guaranteeing perpetual operational safety. Additionally, we
propose model predictive control designs that integrate these control invariant
sets into mixed-integer optimization, with guaranteed adherence to safety
constraints and recursive feasibility at the computational level. We also
present a comprehensive theoretical analysis examining the properties and
guarantees of the proposed methods. Numerical simulations in an autonomous
driving scenario demonstrate the methods' effectiveness in synthesizing
control-invariant sets offline and implementing model predictive control
online, ensuring safety and recursive feasibility.

Motivation: 网络攻击归因是一个复杂但关键的问题，目前依赖人工提取行为指标效率低下，研究旨在利用LLMs自动化这一过程。

Method: 使用GPT-4和text-embedding-3-large提取TTPs，并与MITRE ATT&CK Groups的人工生成数据对比，构建端到端归因管道。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs生成的TTPs存在噪声，但仍对网络攻击归因有实用价值。

Abstract: Attribution of cyber-attacks remains a complex but critical challenge for
cyber defenders. Currently, manual extraction of behavioral indicators from
dense forensic documentation causes significant attribution delays, especially
following major incidents at the international scale. This research evaluates
large language models (LLMs) for cyber-attack attribution based on behavioral
indicators extracted from forensic documentation. We test OpenAI's GPT-4 and
text-embedding-3-large for identifying threat actors' tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) by comparing LLM-generated TTPs against human-generated data
from MITRE ATT&CK Groups. Our framework then identifies TTPs from text using
vector embedding search and builds profiles to attribute new attacks for a
machine learning model to learn. Key contributions include: (1) assessing
off-the-shelf LLMs for TTP extraction and attribution, and (2) developing an
end-to-end pipeline from raw CTI documents to threat-actor prediction. This
research finds that standard LLMs generate TTP datasets with noise, resulting
in a low similarity to human-generated datasets. However, the TTPs generated
are similar in frequency to those within the existing MITRE datasets.
Additionally, although these TTPs are different than human-generated datasets,
our work demonstrates that they still prove useful for training a model that
performs above baseline on attribution. Project code and files are contained

Conclusion: OCR是设计动态真实世界机器人视觉系统的有前景方向。

Abstract: Visual representations are central to the learning and generalization
capabilities of robotic manipulation policies. While existing methods rely on
global or dense features, such representations often entangle task-relevant and
irrelevant scene information, limiting robustness under distribution shifts. In
this work, we investigate object-centric representations (OCR) as a structured
alternative that segments visual input into a finished set of entities,
introducing inductive biases that align more naturally with manipulation tasks.
We benchmark a range of visual encoders-object-centric, global and dense
methods-across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging
from simple to complex, and evaluate their generalization under diverse visual
conditions including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of
distractors. Our findings reveal that OCR-based policies outperform dense and
global representations in generalization settings, even without task-specific
pretraining. These insights suggest that OCR is a promising direction for
designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world
robotic environments.

Abstract: Classification is a common AI problem, and vector search is a typical
solution. This transforms a given body of text into a numerical representation,
known as an embedding, and modern improvements to vector search focus on
optimising speed and predictive accuracy. This is often achieved through neural
methods that aim to learn language semantics. However, our results suggest that
these are not always the best solution. Our task was to classify
rigidly-structured medical documents according to their content, and we found
that using off-the-shelf semantic vector search produced slightly worse
predictive accuracy than creating a bespoke lexical vector search model, and
that it required significantly more time to execute. These findings suggest
that traditional methods deserve to be contenders in the information retrieval
toolkit, despite the prevalence and success of neural models.

Abstract: Training vision-based manipulation policies that are robust across diverse
visual environments remains an important and unresolved challenge in robot
learning. Current approaches often sidestep the problem by relying on invariant
representations such as point clouds and depth, or by brute-forcing
generalization through visual domain randomization and/or large, visually
diverse datasets. Disentangled representation learning - especially when
combined with principles of associative memory - has recently shown promise in
enabling vision-based reinforcement learning policies to be robust to visual
distribution shifts. However, these techniques have largely been constrained to
simpler benchmarks and toy environments. In this work, we scale disentangled
representation learning and associative memory to more visually and dynamically
complex manipulation tasks and demonstrate zero-shot adaptability to visual
perturbations in both simulation and on real hardware. We further extend this
approach to imitation learning, specifically Diffusion Policy, and empirically
show significant gains in visual generalization compared to state-of-the-art
imitation learning methods. Finally, we introduce a novel technique adapted
from the model equivariance literature that transforms any trained neural
network policy into one invariant to 2D planar rotations, making our policy not
only visually robust but also resilient to certain camera perturbations. We
believe that this work marks a significant step towards manipulation policies
that are not only adaptable out of the box, but also robust to the complexities
and dynamical nature of real-world deployment. Supplementary videos are

Abstract: With the rapid development of cloud computing systems and the increasing
complexity of their infrastructure, intelligent mechanisms to detect and
mitigate failures in real time are becoming increasingly important. Traditional
methods of failure detection are often difficult to cope with the scale and
dynamics of modern cloud environments. In this study, we propose a novel AI
framework based on Massive Language Model (LLM) for intelligent fault detection
and self-healing mechanisms in cloud systems. The model combines existing
machine learning fault detection algorithms with LLM's natural language
understanding capabilities to process and parse system logs, error reports, and
real-time data streams through semantic context. The method adopts a
multi-level architecture, combined with supervised learning for fault
classification and unsupervised learning for anomaly detection, so that the
system can predict potential failures before they occur and automatically
trigger the self-healing mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed
model is significantly better than the traditional fault detection system in
terms of fault detection accuracy, system downtime reduction and recovery
speed.

Abstract: Improving the skill of medium-range (1-8 day) severe weather prediction is
crucial for mitigating societal impacts. This study introduces a novel approach
leveraging decoder-only transformer networks to post-process AI-based weather
forecasts, specifically from the Pangu-Weather model, for improved severe
weather guidance. Unlike traditional post-processing methods that use a dense
neural network to predict the probability of severe weather using discrete
forecast samples, our method treats forecast lead times as sequential
``tokens'', enabling the transformer to learn complex temporal relationships
within the evolving atmospheric state. We compare this approach against
post-processing of the Global Forecast System (GFS) using both a traditional
dense neural network and our transformer, as well as configurations that
exclude convective parameters to fairly evaluate the impact of using the
Pangu-Weather AI model. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based
post-processing significantly enhances forecast skill compared to dense neural
networks. Furthermore, AI-driven forecasts, particularly Pangu-Weather
initialized from high resolution analysis, exhibit superior performance to GFS
in the medium-range, even without explicit convective parameters. Our approach
offers improved accuracy, and reliability, which also provides interpretability
through feature attribution analysis, advancing medium-range severe weather
prediction capabilities.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models offer powerful representations for

framework that combines heterogeneous SSL representations (e.g., BEATs, HuBERT,
WavLM) through three fusion strategies: individual SSL embedding integration,
dual-modal fusion, and full aggregation. Experiments on the DCASE 2023 Task 4
Challenge reveal that dual-modal fusion (e.g., CRNN+BEATs+WavLM) achieves
complementary performance gains, while CRNN+BEATs alone delivers the best
results among individual SSL models. We further introduce normalized sound
event bounding boxes (nSEBBs), an adaptive post-processing method that
dynamically adjusts event boundary predictions, improving PSDS1 by up to 4% for
standalone SSL models. These findings highlight the compatibility and
complementarity of SSL architectures, providing guidance for task-specific

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are essential for diagnosing cardiovascular
diseases. While previous ECG-text contrastive learning methods have shown
promising results, they often overlook the incompleteness of the reports. Given
an ECG, the report is generated by first identifying key waveform features and
then inferring the final diagnosis through these features. Despite their
importance, these waveform features are often not recorded in the report as
intermediate results. Aligning ECGs with such incomplete reports impedes the
model's ability to capture the ECG's waveform features and limits its
understanding of diagnostic reasoning based on those features. To address this,
we propose FG-CLEP (Fine-Grained Contrastive Language ECG Pre-training), which
aims to recover these waveform features from incomplete reports with the help
of large language models (LLMs), under the challenges of hallucinations and the
non-bijective relationship between waveform features and diagnoses.
Additionally, considering the frequent false negatives due to the prevalence of
common diagnoses in ECGs, we introduce a semantic similarity matrix to guide
contrastive learning. Furthermore, we adopt a sigmoid-based loss function to
accommodate the multi-label nature of ECG-related tasks. Experiments on six
datasets demonstrate that FG-CLEP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
zero-shot prediction and linear probing across these datasets.

MARVEL, a multi-agent LLM framework for a unified approach to decision-making,
tool use, and reasoning. MARVEL mimics the cognitive process of a designer
looking for security vulnerabilities in RTL code. It consists of a supervisor
agent that devises the security policy of the system-on-chips (SoCs) using its
security documentation. It delegates tasks to validate the security policy to
individual executor agents. Each executor agent carries out its assigned task
using a particular strategy. Each executor agent may use one or more tools to
identify potential security bugs in the design and send the results back to the
supervisor agent for further analysis and confirmation. MARVEL includes
executor agents that leverage formal tools, linters, simulation tests,
LLM-based detection schemes, and static analysis-based checks. We test our
approach on a known buggy SoC based on OpenTitan from the Hack@DATE

Abstract: The rapid rise of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has
transformed information dissemination, but it has also facilitated the spread
of harmful content, particularly hate videos. Despite significant efforts to
combat hate speech, detecting these videos remains challenging due to their
often implicit nature. Current detection methods primarily rely on unimodal
approaches, which inadequately capture the complementary features across
different modalities. While multimodal techniques offer a broader perspective,
many fail to effectively integrate temporal dynamics and modality-wise
interactions essential for identifying nuanced hate content. In this paper, we
present CMFusion, an enhanced multimodal hate video detection model utilizing a
novel Channel-wise and Modality-wise Fusion Mechanism. CMFusion first extracts
features from text, audio, and video modalities using pre-trained models and
then incorporates a temporal cross-attention mechanism to capture dependencies
between video and audio streams. The learned features are then processed by
channel-wise and modality-wise fusion modules to obtain informative
representations of videos. Our extensive experiments on a real-world dataset
demonstrate that CMFusion significantly outperforms five widely used baselines
in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Comprehensive ablation
studies and parameter analyses further validate our design choices,
highlighting the model's effectiveness in detecting hate videos. The source

Abstract: Although deep learning has substantially advanced speech separation in recent
years, most existing studies continue to prioritize separation quality while
overlooking computational efficiency, an essential factor for low-latency
speech processing in real-time applications. In this paper, we propose
SepPrune, the first structured pruning framework specifically designed to
compress deep speech separation models and reduce their computational cost.
SepPrune begins by analyzing the computational structure of a given model to
identify layers with the highest computational burden. It then introduces a
differentiable masking strategy to enable gradient-driven channel selection.
Based on the learned masks, SepPrune prunes redundant channels and fine-tunes
the remaining parameters to recover performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that this learnable pruning paradigm yields substantial advantages
for channel pruning in speech separation models, outperforming existing
methods. Notably, a model pruned with SepPrune can recover 85% of the
performance of a pre-trained model (trained over hundreds of epochs) with only
one epoch of fine-tuning, and achieves convergence 36$\times$ faster than
training from scratch. Code is available at

Abstract: People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for
which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with
differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less
known-role in subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their
reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not
numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has
predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical
forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is
vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our
theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and
only communicated through language.

Abstract: There has been substantial progress in the inference of formal behavioural
specifications from sample trajectories, for example, using Linear Temporal
Logic (LTL). However, these techniques cannot handle specifications that
correctly characterise systems with stochastic behaviour, which occur commonly
in reinforcement learning and formal verification. We consider the passive
learning problem of inferring a Boolean combination of probabilistic LTL (PLTL)
formulas from a set of Markov chains, classified as either positive or
negative. We propose a novel learning algorithm that infers concise PLTL
specifications, leveraging grammar-based enumeration, search heuristics,
probabilistic model checking and Boolean set-cover procedures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our algorithm in two use cases: learning from policies
induced by RL algorithms and learning from variants of a probabilistic model.
In both cases, our method automatically and efficiently extracts PLTL
specifications that succinctly characterise the temporal differences between
the policies or model variants.

TL;DR: VoiceCloak是一种针对扩散模型（DMs）的多维主动防御框架，旨在通过对抗性扰动破坏未经授权的语音克隆（VC），同时模糊说话者身份并降低感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语音克隆中表现出色，但也增加了恶意滥用的风险。现有的防御方法不适用于扩散模型，因此需要新的防御框架。

Method: VoiceCloak通过分析扩散模型的漏洞，引入对抗性扰动，包括扭曲说话者身份嵌入、干扰条件引导过程（如注意力上下文），以及通过分数幅度放大和噪声引导语义破坏降低输出质量。

Result: 实验表明，VoiceCloak在防御未经授权的扩散模型语音克隆方面表现出色。

Conclusion: VoiceCloak为扩散模型提供了一种有效的主动防御方法，解决了现有防御不兼容的问题。

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice
cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing
proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the
forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the
intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of
obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential
unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to
identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt
the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference
audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets
speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize
identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles.
Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes,
particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal
characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to
address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude
amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation
of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to
disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality.
Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate
against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak
are available at https://voice-cloak.github.io/VoiceCloak/.

Arbitrator, and Critic. These multi-agent components interact with various
tools to accelerate the optimization process. LLM-DSE leverages essential
domain knowledge to identify efficient parameter combinations while maintaining
adaptability through verbal learning from online interactions. Evaluations on
the HLSyn dataset demonstrate that LLM-DSE achieves substantial $2.55\times$

Result: 实验表明，SFM显著提升了语音合成的自然度（客观和主观评估），同时在使用自适应步长ODE求解器时大幅减少推理时间。

Conclusion: SFM是一种轻量级且高效的机制，可有效提升FM-based TTS模型的性能。

Abstract: We propose a shallow flow matching (SFM) mechanism to enhance flow matching
(FM)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models within a coarse-to-fine generation
paradigm. SFM constructs intermediate states along the FM paths using coarse
output representations. During training, we introduce an orthogonal projection
method to adaptively determine the temporal position of these states, and apply
a principled construction strategy based on a single-segment piecewise flow.
The SFM inference starts from the intermediate state rather than pure noise and
focuses computation on the latter stages of the FM paths. We integrate SFM into
multiple TTS models with a lightweight SFM head. Experiments show that SFM
consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech in both objective
and subjective evaluations, while significantly reducing inference when using
adaptive-step ODE solvers. Demo and codes are available at

Conclusion: 统一的多任务方法在多模态音乐翻译中表现出色，为跨模态音乐生成开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Music exists in various modalities, such as score images, symbolic scores,
MIDI, and audio. Translations between each modality are established as core
tasks of music information retrieval, such as automatic music transcription
(audio-to-MIDI) and optical music recognition (score image to symbolic score).
However, most past work on multimodal translation trains specialized models on
individual translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified approach,
where we train a general-purpose model on many translation tasks
simultaneously. Two key factors make this unified approach viable: a new
large-scale dataset and the tokenization of each modality. Firstly, we propose
a new dataset that consists of more than 1,300 hours of paired audio-score
image data collected from YouTube videos, which is an order of magnitude larger
than any existing music modal translation datasets. Secondly, our unified
tokenization framework discretizes score images, audio, MIDI, and MusicXML into
a sequence of tokens, enabling a single encoder-decoder Transformer to tackle
multiple cross-modal translation as one coherent sequence-to-sequence task.
Experimental results confirm that our unified multitask model improves upon
single-task baselines in several key areas, notably reducing the symbol error
rate for optical music recognition from 24.58% to a state-of-the-art 13.67%,
while similarly substantial improvements are observed across the other
translation tasks. Notably, our approach achieves the first successful
score-image-conditioned audio generation, marking a significant breakthrough in
cross-modal music generation.

Conclusion: PPCS首次将预训练和提示范式引入半监督社区搜索，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt" paradigm is widely adopted in various graph-based
tasks and has shown promising performance in community detection. Most existing
semi-supervised community detection algorithms detect communities based on
known ones, and the detected communities typically do not contain the given
query node. Therefore, they are not suitable for searching the community of a
given node. Motivated by this, we adopt this paradigm into the semi-supervised
community search for the first time and propose Pre-trained Prompt-driven
Community Search (PPCS), a novel model designed to enhance search accuracy and
efficiency. PPCS consists of three main components: node encoding, sample
generation, and prompt-driven fine-tuning. Specifically, the node encoding
component employs graph neural networks to learn local structural patterns of
nodes in a graph, thereby obtaining representations for nodes and communities.
Next, the sample generation component identifies an initial community for a
given node and selects known communities that are structurally similar to the
initial one as training samples. Finally, the prompt-driven fine-tuning
component leverages these samples as prompts to guide the final community
prediction. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that
PPCS performs better than baseline algorithms. It also achieves higher
community search efficiency than semi-supervised community search baseline
methods, with ablation studies verifying the effectiveness of each component of
PPCS.

Abstract: Real-world networks often involve both keywords and locations, along with
travel time variations between locations due to traffic conditions. However,
most existing cohesive subgraph-based community search studies utilize a single
attribute, either keywords or locations, to identify communities. They do not
simultaneously consider both keywords and locations, which results in low
semantic or spatial cohesiveness of the detected communities, and they fail to
account for variations in travel time. Additionally, these studies traverse the
entire network to build efficient indexes, but the detected community only
involves nodes around the query node, leading to the traversal of nodes that
are not relevant to the community. Therefore, we propose the problem of
discovering semantic-spatial aware k-core, which refers to a k-core with high
semantic and time-dependent spatial cohesiveness containing the query node. To
address this problem, we propose an exact and a greedy algorithm, both of which
gradually expand outward from the query node. They are local methods that only
access the local part of the attributed network near the query node rather than
the entire network. Moreover, we design a method to calculate the semantic
similarity between two keywords using large language models. This method
alleviates the disadvantages of keyword-matching methods used in existing
community search studies, such as mismatches caused by differently expressed
synonyms and the presence of irrelevant words. Experimental results show that
the greedy algorithm outperforms baselines in terms of structural, semantic,
and time-dependent spatial cohesiveness.

Result: 方法在单/多agent场景和闯红灯场景中表现出色，平衡了鲁棒性和保守性。

Conclusion: 混合分布评分方法有效解决了对抗性行为与正常行为的权衡问题。

Abstract: We describe a robust planning method for autonomous driving that mixes normal
and adversarial agent predictions output by a diffusion model trained for
motion prediction. We first train a diffusion model to learn an unbiased
distribution of normal agent behaviors. We then generate a distribution of
adversarial predictions by biasing the diffusion model at test time to generate
predictions that are likely to collide with a candidate plan. We score plans
using expected cost with respect to a mixture distribution of normal and
adversarial predictions, leading to a planner that is robust against
adversarial behaviors but not overly conservative when agents behave normally.
Unlike current approaches, we do not use risk measures that over-weight
adversarial behaviors while placing little to no weight on low-cost normal
behaviors or use hard safety constraints that may not be appropriate for all
driving scenarios. We show the effectiveness of our method on single-agent and
multi-agent jaywalking scenarios as well as a red light violation scenario.

Abstract: As GenAI platforms grow, their dependence on content from competing
providers, combined with access to alternative data sources, creates new
challenges for data-sharing decisions. In this paper, we provide a model of
data sharing between a content creation firm and a GenAI platform that can also
acquire content from third-party experts. The interaction is modeled as a
Stackelberg game: the firm first decides how much of its proprietary dataset to
share with GenAI, and GenAI subsequently determines how much additional data to
acquire from external experts. Their utilities depend on user traffic, monetary
transfers, and the cost of acquiring additional data from external experts. We
characterize the unique subgame perfect equilibrium of the game and uncover a
surprising phenomenon: The firm may be willing to pay GenAI to share the firm's
own data, leading to a costly data-sharing equilibrium. We further characterize
the set of Pareto improving data prices, and show that such improvements occur
only when the firm pays to share data. Finally, we study how the price can be
set to optimize different design objectives, such as promoting firm data
sharing, expert data acquisition, or a balance of both. Our results shed light
on the economic forces shaping data-sharing partnerships in the age of GenAI,

Abstract: Recent Foundation Model-enabled robotics (FMRs) display greatly improved
general-purpose skills, enabling more adaptable automation than conventional
robotics. Their ability to handle diverse tasks thus creates new opportunities
to replace human labor. However, unlike general foundation models, FMRs
interact with the physical world, where their actions directly affect the
safety of humans and surrounding objects, requiring careful deployment and
control. Based on this proposition, our survey comprehensively summarizes robot
control approaches to mitigate physical risks by covering all the lifespan of
FMRs ranging from pre-deployment to post-accident stage. Specifically, we
broadly divide the timeline into the following three phases: (1) pre-deployment
phase, (2) pre-incident phase, and (3) post-incident phase. Throughout this
survey, we find that there is much room to study (i) pre-incident risk
mitigation strategies, (ii) research that assumes physical interaction with
humans, and (iii) essential issues of foundation models themselves. We hope
that this survey will be a milestone in providing a high-resolution analysis of
the physical risks of FMRs and their control, contributing to the realization
of a good human-robot relationship.

Conclusion: OZSpeech offers a more efficient and precise TTS approach by leveraging advanced flow matching and tokenized speech attributes.

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have seen significant advancements in recent
years, driven by improvements in deep learning and neural network
architectures. Viewing the output speech as a data distribution, previous
approaches often employ traditional speech representations, such as waveforms
or spectrograms, within the Flow Matching framework. However, these methods
have limitations, including overlooking various speech attributes and incurring
high computational costs due to additional constraints introduced during
training. To address these challenges, we introduce OZSpeech, the first TTS
method to explore optimal transport conditional flow matching with one-step
sampling and a learned prior as the condition, effectively disregarding
preceding states and reducing the number of sampling steps. Our approach
operates on disentangled, factorized components of speech in token format,
enabling accurate modeling of each speech attribute, which enhances the TTS
system's ability to precisely clone the prompt speech. Experimental results
show that our method achieves promising performance over existing methods in
content accuracy, naturalness, prosody generation, and speaker style
preservation. Audio samples are available at our demo page

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement Learning (MARL) is often challenged by the sight

called Dynamic Sight Range Selection (DSR), to address this issue. DSR utilizes
an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and dynamically adjusts the sight
range during training. Experiment results show several advantages of using DSR.
First, we demonstrate using DSR achieves better performance in three common
MARL environments, including Level-Based Foraging (LBF), Multi-Robot Warehouse
(RWARE), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC). Second, our results show
that DSR consistently improves performance across multiple MARL algorithms,
including QMIX and MAPPO. Third, DSR offers suitable sight ranges for different
training steps, thereby accelerating the training process. Finally, DSR
provides additional interpretability by indicating the optimal sight range used
during training. Unlike existing methods that rely on global information or
communication mechanisms, our approach operates solely based on the individual
sight ranges of agents. This approach offers a practical and efficient solution
to the sight range dilemma, making it broadly applicable to real-world complex
environments.

exclude misaligned updates. It then dynamically selects a reference client
based on the prior global model to mitigate non-i.i.d. bias, assigns
aggregation weights inversely proportional to angular deviations, and
normalizes update magnitudes to suppress malicious scaling. Evaluations across
datasets of varying complexity under five classic attacks demonstrate FLTG's
superiority over state-of-the-art methods under extreme bias scenarios and
sustains robustness with a higher proportion(over 50%) of malicious clients.

Conclusion: 该方法在隐私保护和计算效率上优于现有技术，适用于小数据集。

Abstract: Feature selection is a technique that extracts a meaningful subset from a set
of features in training data. When the training data is large-scale,
appropriate feature selection enables the removal of redundant features, which
can improve generalization performance, accelerate the training process, and
enhance the interpretability of the model. This study proposes a
privacy-preserving computation model for feature selection. Generally, when the
data owner and analyst are the same, there is no need to conceal the private
information. However, when they are different parties or when multiple owners
exist, an appropriate privacy-preserving framework is required. Although
various private feature selection algorithms, they all require two or more
computing parties and do not guarantee security in environments where no
external party can be fully trusted. To address this issue, we propose the
first outsourcing algorithm for feature selection using fully homomorphic
encryption. Compared to a prior two-party algorithm, our result improves the
time and space complexity O(kn^2) to O(kn log^3 n) and O(kn), where k and n
denote the number of features and data samples, respectively. We also
implemented the proposed algorithm and conducted comparative experiments with
the naive one. The experimental result shows the efficiency of our method even
with small datasets.

Abstract: Source detection on graphs has demonstrated high efficacy in identifying
rumor origins. Despite advances in machine learning-based methods, many fail to
capture intrinsic dynamics of rumor propagation. In this work, we present
SourceDetMamba: A Graph-aware State Space Model for Source Detection in
Sequential Hypergraphs, which harnesses the recent success of the state space
model Mamba, known for its superior global modeling capabilities and
computational efficiency, to address this challenge. Specifically, we first
employ hypergraphs to model high-order interactions within social networks.
Subsequently, temporal network snapshots generated during the propagation
process are sequentially fed in reverse order into Mamba to infer underlying
propagation dynamics. Finally, to empower the sequential model to effectively
capture propagation patterns while integrating structural information, we
propose a novel graph-aware state update mechanism, wherein the state of each
node is propagated and refined by both temporal dependencies and topological
context. Extensive evaluations on eight datasets demonstrate that
SourceDetMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: GM-OT通过结构化对齐有效提升了模态间知识迁移的效率。

Abstract: Transferring linguistic knowledge from a pretrained language model (PLM) to
acoustic feature learning has proven effective in enhancing end-to-end
automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR). However, aligning representations
between linguistic and acoustic modalities remains a challenge due to inherent
modality gaps. Optimal transport (OT) has shown promise in mitigating these
gaps by minimizing the Wasserstein distance (WD) between linguistic and
acoustic feature distributions. However, previous OT-based methods overlook
structural relationships, treating feature vectors as unordered sets. To
address this, we propose Graph Matching Optimal Transport (GM-OT), which models
linguistic and acoustic sequences as structured graphs. Nodes represent feature
embeddings, while edges capture temporal and sequential relationships. GM-OT
minimizes both WD (between nodes) and Gromov-Wasserstein distance (GWD)
(between edges), leading to a fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance (FGWD)
formulation. This enables structured alignment and more efficient knowledge
transfer compared to existing OT-based approaches. Theoretical analysis further
shows that prior OT-based methods in linguistic knowledge transfer can be
viewed as a special case within our GM-OT framework. We evaluate GM-OT on
Mandarin ASR using a CTC-based E2E-ASR system with a PLM for knowledge
transfer. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art models, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We introduce MultiActor-Audiobook, a zero-shot approach for generating
audiobooks that automatically produces consistent, expressive, and
speaker-appropriate prosody, including intonation and emotion. Previous
audiobook systems have several limitations: they require users to manually
configure the speaker's prosody, read each sentence with a monotonic tone
compared to voice actors, or rely on costly training. However, our
MultiActor-Audiobook addresses these issues by introducing two novel processes:
(1) MSP (**Multimodal Speaker Persona Generation**) and (2) LSI (**LLM-based
Script Instruction Generation**). With these two processes,
MultiActor-Audiobook can generate more emotionally expressive audiobooks with a
consistent speaker prosody without additional training. We compare our system
with commercial products, through human and MLLM evaluations, achieving
competitive results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MSP and
LSI through ablation studies.

Abstract: In-hand manipulation and grasping are fundamental yet often separately
addressed tasks in robotics. For deriving in-hand manipulation policies,
reinforcement learning has recently shown great success. However, the derived
controllers are not yet useful in real-world scenarios because they often
require a human operator to place the objects in suitable initial (grasping)
states. Finding stable grasps that also promote the desired in-hand
manipulation goal is an open problem. In this work, we propose a method for
bridging this gap by leveraging the critic network of a reinforcement learning
agent trained for in-hand manipulation to score and select initial grasps. Our
experiments show that this method significantly increases the success rate of
in-hand manipulation without requiring additional training. We also present an
implementation of a full grasp manipulation pipeline on a real-world system,
enabling autonomous grasping and reorientation even of unwieldy objects.

Abstract: In the age of cloud computing, data privacy protection has become a major
challenge, especially when sharing sensitive data across cloud environments.
However, how to optimize collaboration across cloud environments remains an
unresolved problem. In this paper, we combine federated learning with
large-scale language models to optimize the collaborative mechanism of AI
systems. Based on the existing federated learning framework, we introduce a
cross-cloud architecture in which federated learning works by aggregating model
updates from decentralized nodes without exposing the original data. At the
same time, combined with large-scale language models, its powerful context and
semantic understanding capabilities are used to improve model training
efficiency and decision-making ability. We've further innovated by introducing
a secure communication layer to ensure the privacy and integrity of model
updates and training data. The model enables continuous model adaptation and
fine-tuning across different cloud environments while protecting sensitive
data. Experimental results show that the proposed method is significantly
better than the traditional federated learning model in terms of accuracy,
convergence speed and data privacy protection.

Abstract: Robotic bin packing aids in a wide range of real-world scenarios such as
e-commerce and warehouses. Yet, existing works focus mainly on considering the
shape of objects to optimize packing compactness and neglect object properties
such as fragility, edibility, and chemistry that humans typically consider when
packing objects. This paper presents OPA-Pack (Object-Property-Aware Packing
framework), the first framework that equips the robot with object property
considerations in planning the object packing. Technical-wise, we develop a
novel object property recognition scheme with retrieval-augmented generation
and chain-of-thought reasoning, and build a dataset with object property
annotations for 1,032 everyday objects. Also, we formulate OPA-Net, aiming to
jointly separate incompatible object pairs and reduce pressure on fragile
objects, while compacting the packing. Further, OPA-Net consists of a property
embedding layer to encode the property of candidate objects to be packed,
together with a fragility heightmap and an avoidance heightmap to keep track of
the packed objects. Then, we design a reward function and adopt a deep
Q-learning scheme to train OPA-Net. Experimental results manifest that OPA-Pack
greatly improves the accuracy of separating incompatible object pairs (from 52%
to 95%) and largely reduces pressure on fragile objects (by 29.4%), while
maintaining good packing compactness. Besides, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of OPA-Pack on a real packing platform, showcasing its practicality in
real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Instant food delivery has become one of the most popular web services
worldwide due to its convenience in daily life. A fundamental challenge is
accurately predicting courier routes to optimize task dispatch and improve
delivery efficiency. This enhances satisfaction for couriers and users and
increases platform profitability. The current heuristic prediction method uses
only limited human-selected task features and ignores couriers preferences,
causing suboptimal results. Additionally, existing learning-based methods do
not fully capture the diverse factors influencing courier decisions or the
complex relationships among them. To address this, we propose a
Multi-Relational Graph-based Route Prediction (MRGRP) method that models
fine-grained correlations among tasks affecting courier decisions for accurate
prediction. We encode spatial and temporal proximity, along with
pickup-delivery relationships, into a multi-relational graph and design a
GraphFormer architecture to capture these complex connections. We also
introduce a route decoder that leverages courier information and dynamic
distance and time contexts for prediction, using existing route solutions as
references to improve outcomes. Experiments show our model achieves
state-of-the-art route prediction on offline data from cities of various sizes.
Deployed on the Meituan Turing platform, it surpasses the current heuristic
algorithm, reaching a high route prediction accuracy of 0.819, essential for
courier and user satisfaction in instant food delivery.

Abstract: Cost-aware Dynamic Workflow Scheduling (CADWS) is a key challenge in cloud
computing, focusing on devising an effective scheduling policy to efficiently
schedule dynamically arriving workflow tasks, represented as Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAG), to suitable virtual machines (VMs). Deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) has been widely employed for automated scheduling policy design. However,
the performance of DRL is heavily influenced by the design of the
problem-tailored policy network and is highly sensitive to hyperparameters and
the design of reward feedback. Considering the above-mentioned issues, this
study proposes a novel DRL method combining Graph Attention Networks-based
policy network and Evolution Strategy, referred to as GATES. The contributions
of GATES are summarized as follows: (1) GATES can capture the impact of current
task scheduling on subsequent tasks by learning the topological relationships
between tasks in a DAG. (2) GATES can learn the importance of each VM to ready
tasks, increasing the chance of selecting the optimal VM. (3) Utilizing
Evolution Strategy's robustness, exploratory nature, and tolerance for delayed
rewards, GATES achieves stable policy learning in CADWS. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GATES in CADWS,

Abstract: Traffic congestion has long been an ubiquitous problem that is exacerbating
with the rapid growth of megacities. In this proof-of-concept work we study
intrinsic motivation, implemented via the empowerment principle, to control
autonomous car behavior to improve traffic flow. In standard models of traffic
dynamics, self-organized traffic jams emerge spontaneously from the individual
behavior of cars, affecting traffic over long distances. Our novel car behavior
strategy improves traffic flow while still being decentralized and using only
locally available information without explicit coordination. Decentralization
is essential for various reasons, not least to be able to absorb robustly
substantial levels of uncertainty. Our scenario is based on the
well-established traffic dynamics model, the Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular
automaton. In a fraction of the cars in this model, we substitute the default
behavior by empowerment, our intrinsic motivation-based method. This proposed
model significantly improves overall traffic flow, mitigates congestion, and
reduces the average traffic jam time.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is widely used in fields such as
scheduling, logistics, and planning. Enhancing the performance of MILP solvers,
particularly learning-based solvers, requires substantial amounts of
high-quality data. However, existing methods for MILP instance generation
typically necessitate training a separate model for each problem class and are
computationally intensive when generating new instances. To address these
limitations, we reformulate the MILP Instance Generation task as MILP Code
Generation task, enabling efficient, flexible, and interpretable instance
generation through code. Since MILP instances generated from code can vary
significantly in scale, we introduce MILP-EmbedSim, a new similarity metric
that accurately measures the similarity between instances of varying sizes
within the same problem class. Leveraging this metric, we propose
MILP-Retrieval, a pipeline that retrieves generation code from library to
produce MILP instances highly similar to target instance. MILP-Retrieval
outperforms baselines in both MILP Code Generation and Instance Generation
tasks, provides a novel perspective on MILP instance generation and opens new
possibilities for learning-based solvers.

Motivation: 解决传统图推荐系统过度依赖低通滤波和忽略时序动态的问题。

Method: 结合时序信息构建图，采用多跳扩散编码项目转移，并设计双滤波机制（高斯带通和低通滤波）。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上平均NDCG@10提升6.77%，验证了时序图增强和带通滤波的互补性。

Conclusion: GSPRec通过谱域处理和时序动态建模显著提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: Graph-based recommendation systems are effective at modeling collaborative
patterns but often suffer from two limitations: overreliance on low-pass
filtering, which suppresses user-specific signals, and omission of sequential
dynamics in graph construction. We introduce GSPRec, a graph spectral model
that integrates temporal transitions through sequentially-informed graph
construction and applies frequency-aware filtering in the spectral domain.
GSPRec encodes item transitions via multi-hop diffusion to enable the use of
symmetric Laplacians for spectral processing. To capture user preferences, we
design a dual-filtering mechanism: a Gaussian bandpass filter to extract
mid-frequency, user-level patterns, and a low-pass filter to retain global
trends. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that GSPRec
consistently outperforms baselines, with an average improvement of 6.77% in
NDCG@10. Ablation studies show the complementary benefits of both sequential
graph augmentation and bandpass filtering.

Abstract: Photonic neural networks (PNNs), which share the inherent benefits of
photonic systems, such as high parallelism and low power consumption, could
challenge traditional digital neural networks in terms of energy efficiency,
latency, and throughput. However, producing scalable photonic artificial
intelligence (AI) solutions remains challenging. To make photonic AI models
viable, the scalability problem needs to be solved. Large optical AI models
implemented on PNNs are only commercially feasible if the advantages of optical
computation outweigh the cost of their input-output overhead. In this
Perspective, we discuss how field-programmable metasurface technology may
become a key hardware ingredient in achieving scalable photonic AI accelerators
and how it can compete with current digital electronic technologies.
Programmability or reconfigurability is a pivotal component for PNN hardware,
enabling in situ training and accommodating non-stationary use cases that
require fine-tuning or transfer learning. Co-integration with electronics, 3D
stacking, and large-scale manufacturing of metasurfaces would significantly
improve PNN scalability and functionalities. Programmable metasurfaces could
address some of the current challenges that PNNs face and enable

Motivation: 安全关键控制器的需求在自动驾驶和机器人领域日益增长，但传统CBF方法在高维空间中难以生成且缺乏完整性。

Method: 利用PINNs计算Hamilton-Jacobi最优控制解，生成平滑的CBFs（称为RBNs），并通过参数化折扣项调整保守性，同时使用共形预测方法提供概率安全保证。

Result: RBNs在低维空间中高度准确，在高维空间中比标准神经CBF方法更安全（9D多车避碰问题中安全性能提升5.5倍，保守性降低1.9倍）。

Conclusion: RBNs为非线性自治系统的CBF合成提供了一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Recent developments in autonomous driving and robotics underscore the
necessity of safety-critical controllers. Control barrier functions (CBFs) are
a popular method for appending safety guarantees to a general control
framework, but they are notoriously difficult to generate beyond low
dimensions. Existing methods often yield non-differentiable or inaccurate
approximations that lack integrity, and thus fail to ensure safety. In this
work, we use physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to generate smooth
approximations of CBFs by computing Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) optimal control
solutions. These reachability barrier networks (RBNs) avoid traditional
dimensionality constraints and support the tuning of their conservativeness
post-training through a parameterized discount term. To ensure robustness of
the discounted solutions, we leverage conformal prediction methods to derive
probabilistic safety guarantees for RBNs. We demonstrate that RBNs are highly
accurate in low dimensions, and safer than the standard neural CBF approach in
high dimensions. Namely, we showcase the RBNs in a 9D multi-vehicle collision
avoidance problem where it empirically proves to be 5.5x safer and 1.9x less
conservative than the neural CBFs, offering a promising method to synthesize
CBFs for general nonlinear autonomous systems.

Abstract: As modern software systems expand in scale and complexity, the challenges
associated with their modeling and formulation grow increasingly intricate.
Traditional approaches often fall short in effectively addressing these
complexities, particularly in tasks such as design pattern detection for
maintenance and assessment, as well as code refactoring for optimization and
long-term sustainability. This growing inadequacy underscores the need for a

ASE enables effective modeling and resolution of complex software engineering
problems. The paradigm is evaluated through two frameworks
Behavioral-Structural Sequences (BSS) and Optimized Design Refactoring (ODR),
both developed in accordance with ASE principles. BSS offers a compact,
language-agnostic representation of codebases to facilitate precise design
pattern detection. ODR unifies artifact and solution representations to
optimize code refactoring via heuristic algorithms while eliminating iterative
computational overhead. By providing a structured approach to software design
challenges, ASE lays the groundwork for future research in encoding and

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised medical segmentation co-learning frameworks have
realized that model performance can be diminished by the biases in model
recognition caused by low-quality pseudo-labels. Due to the averaging nature of
their pseudo-label integration strategy, they fail to explore the reliability
of pseudo-labels from different sources. In this paper, we propose a mutual
evidential deep learning (MEDL) framework that offers a potentially viable
solution for pseudo-label generation in semi-supervised learning from two
perspectives. First, we introduce networks with different architectures to
generate complementary evidence for unlabeled samples and adopt an improved
class-aware evidential fusion to guide the confident synthesis of evidential
predictions sourced from diverse architectural networks. Second, utilizing the
uncertainty in the fused evidence, we design an asymptotic Fisher
information-based evidential learning strategy. This strategy enables the model
to initially focus on unlabeled samples with more reliable pseudo-labels,
gradually shifting attention to samples with lower-quality pseudo-labels while
avoiding over-penalization of mislabeled classes in high data uncertainty
samples. Additionally, for labeled data, we continue to adopt an
uncertainty-driven asymptotic learning strategy, gradually guiding the model to
focus on challenging voxels. Extensive experiments on five mainstream datasets
have demonstrated that MEDL achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: FreqSelect不仅提高了解码准确性，还为神经科学研究提供了可解释的工具，具有扩展到其他神经成像模态的潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing natural images from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data remains a core challenge in natural decoding due to the mismatch
between the richness of visual stimuli and the noisy, low resolution nature of
fMRI signals. While recent two-stage models, combining deep variational
autoencoders (VAEs) with diffusion models, have advanced this task, they treat
all spatial-frequency components of the input equally. This uniform treatment
forces the model to extract meaning features and suppress irrelevant noise
simultaneously, limiting its effectiveness. We introduce FreqSelect, a
lightweight, adaptive module that selectively filters spatial-frequency bands
before encoding. By dynamically emphasizing frequencies that are most
predictive of brain activity and suppressing those that are uninformative,
FreqSelect acts as a content-aware gate between image features and natural
data. It integrates seamlessly into standard very deep VAE-diffusion pipelines
and requires no additional supervision. Evaluated on the Natural Scenes
dataset, FreqSelect consistently improves reconstruction quality across both
low- and high-level metrics. Beyond performance gains, the learned
frequency-selection patterns offer interpretable insights into how different
visual frequencies are represented in the brain. Our method generalizes across
subjects and scenes, and holds promise for extension to other neuroimaging
modalities, offering a principled approach to enhancing both decoding accuracy
and neuroscientific interpretability.

dexterous teleoperation. TeleOpBench contains 30 high-fidelity task
environments that span pick-and-place, tool use, and collaborative
manipulation, covering a broad spectrum of kinematic and force-interaction
difficulty. Within this benchmark we implement four representative
teleoperation modalities-(i) MoCap, (ii) VR device, (iii) arm-hand
exoskeletons, and (iv) monocular vision tracking-and evaluate them with a
common protocol and metric suite. To validate that performance in simulation is
predictive of real-world behavior, we conduct mirrored experiments on a
physical dual-arm platform equipped with two 6-DoF dexterous hands. Across 10
held-out tasks we observe a strong correlation between simulator and hardware
performance, confirming the external validity of TeleOpBench. TeleOpBench
establishes a common yardstick for teleoperation research and provides an

Abstract: Human motion synthesis in complex scenes presents a fundamental challenge,
extending beyond conventional Text-to-Motion tasks by requiring the integration
of diverse modalities such as static environments, movable objects, natural
language prompts, and spatial waypoints. Existing language-conditioned motion
models often struggle with scene-aware motion generation due to limitations in
motion tokenization, which leads to information loss and fails to capture the
continuous, context-dependent nature of 3D human movement. To address these
issues, we propose UniHM, a unified motion language model that leverages
diffusion-based generation for synthesizing scene-aware human motion. UniHM is
the first framework to support both Text-to-Motion and Text-to-Human-Object
Interaction (HOI) in complex 3D scenes. Our approach introduces three key
contributions: (1) a mixed-motion representation that fuses continuous 6DoF
motion with discrete local motion tokens to improve motion realism; (2) a novel
Look-Up-Free Quantization VAE (LFQ-VAE) that surpasses traditional VQ-VAEs in
both reconstruction accuracy and generative performance; and (3) an enriched
version of the Lingo dataset augmented with HumanML3D annotations, providing
stronger supervision for scene-specific motion learning. Experimental results
demonstrate that UniHM achieves comparative performance on the OMOMO benchmark
for text-to-HOI synthesis and yields competitive results on HumanML3D for
general text-conditioned motion generation.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising biologically plausible models of
computation which utilize a spiking binary activation function similar to that
of biological neurons. SNNs are well positioned to process spatiotemporal data,
and are advantageous in ultra-low power and real-time processing. Despite a
large body of work on conventional artificial neural network accelerators, much
less attention has been given to efficient SNN hardware accelerator design. In
particular, SNNs exhibit inherent unstructured spatial and temporal firing
sparsity, an opportunity yet to be fully explored for great hardware processing
efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel systolic-array SNN accelerator
architecture, called SpikeX, to take on the challenges and opportunities
stemming from unstructured sparsity while taking into account the unique
characteristics of spike-based computation. By developing an efficient dataflow
targeting expensive multi-bit weight data movements, SpikeX reduces memory
access and increases data sharing and hardware utilization for computations
spanning across both time and space, thereby significantly improving energy
efficiency and inference latency. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of
SNN network and hardware co-design, we develop a co-optimization methodology
facilitating not only hardware-aware SNN training but also hardware accelerator
architecture search, allowing joint network weight parameter optimization and
accelerator architectural reconfiguration. This end-to-end network/accelerator
co-design approach offers a significant reduction of 15.1x-150.87x in
energy-delay-product(EDP) without comprising model accuracy.

Result: 实验表明，这些技术能显著降低单次路径规划成本（提升10-20%），且不影响计算速度。

Conclusion: 两种断点技术在不牺牲PIBT计算优势的前提下，显著提升了路径规划的性能。

Abstract: PIBT is a computationally lightweight algorithm that can be applied to a
variety of multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems, generating the next
collision-free locations of agents given another. Because of its simplicity and
scalability, it is becoming a popular underlying scheme for recent large-scale
MAPF methods involving several hundreds or thousands of agents. Vanilla PIBT
makes agents behave greedily towards their assigned goals, while agents
typically have multiple best actions, since the graph shortest path is not
always unique. Consequently, tiebreaking about how to choose between these
actions significantly affects resulting solutions. This paper studies two
simple yet effective techniques for tiebreaking in PIBT, without compromising
its computational advantage. The first technique allows an agent to
intelligently dodge another, taking into account whether each action will
hinder the progress of the next timestep. The second technique is to learn,
through multiple PIBT runs, how an action causes regret in others and to use
this information to minimise regret collectively. Our empirical results
demonstrate that these techniques can reduce the solution cost of one-shot MAPF
and improve the throughput of lifelong MAPF. For instance, in densely populated
one-shot cases, the combined use of these tiebreaks achieves improvements of
around 10-20% in sum-of-costs, without significantly compromising the speed of
a PIBT-based planner.

Abstract: The advent of single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using
sequencing (scATAC-seq) offers an innovative perspective for deciphering
regulatory mechanisms by assembling a vast repository of single-cell chromatin
accessibility data. While foundation models have achieved significant success
in single-cell transcriptomics, there is currently no foundation model for
scATAC-seq that supports zero-shot high-quality cell identification and
comprehensive multi-omics analysis simultaneously. Key challenges lie in the
high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data, as well as the lack of a
standardized schema for representing open chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we
present \textbf{ChromFound}, a foundation model tailored for scATAC-seq.
ChromFound utilizes a hybrid architecture and genome-aware tokenization to
effectively capture genome-wide long contexts and regulatory signals from
dynamic chromatin landscapes. Pretrained on 1.97 million cells from 30 tissues
and 6 disease conditions, ChromFound demonstrates broad applicability across 6
diverse tasks. Notably, it achieves robust zero-shot performance in generating
universal cell representations and exhibits excellent transferability in cell
type annotation and cross-omics prediction. By uncovering enhancer-gene links
undetected by existing computational methods, ChromFound offers a promising
framework for understanding disease risk variants in the noncoding genome.

Conclusion: 结合物理知识与生成模型的多视角感知框架有效提升了目标重建的精度和适应性。

Abstract: In this paper, we incorporate physical knowledge into learning-based
high-precision target sensing using the multi-view channel state information
(CSI) between multiple base stations (BSs) and user equipment (UEs). Such kind
of multi-view sensing problem can be naturally cast into a conditional
generation framework. To this end, we design a bipartite neural network
architecture, the first part of which uses an elaborately designed encoder to
fuse the latent target features embedded in the multi-view CSI, and then the
second uses them as conditioning inputs of a powerful generative model to guide
the target's reconstruction. Specifically, the encoder is designed to capture
the physical correlation between the CSI and the target, and also be adaptive
to the numbers and positions of BS-UE pairs. Therein the view-specific nature
of CSI is assimilated by introducing a spatial positional embedding scheme,
which exploits the structure of electromagnetic(EM)-wave propagation channels.
Finally, a conditional diffusion model with a weighted loss is employed to
generate the target's point cloud from the fused features. Extensive numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed generative multi-view (Gen-MV) sensing
framework exhibits excellent flexibility and significant performance
improvement on the reconstruction quality of target's shape and EM properties.

Motivation: 改进符号音乐生成的质量和连贯性，使其更符合输入标题的描述。

Method: 引入两个目标分数：文本-音频一致性分数（衡量生成音乐与原始文本标题的节奏对齐）和和谐一致性分数（惩罚与调性不一致的音符）。在生成过程中优化这些对齐目标。

Result: 在Text2midi模型基础上显著提升了客观和主观评价指标。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练或微调即可扩展至任何自回归模型，有效提升生成音乐的质量和连贯性。

Abstract: We present Text2midi-InferAlign, a novel technique for improving symbolic
music generation at inference time. Our method leverages text-to-audio
alignment and music structural alignment rewards during inference to encourage
the generated music to be consistent with the input caption. Specifically, we
introduce two objectives scores: a text-audio consistency score that measures
rhythmic alignment between the generated music and the original text caption,
and a harmonic consistency score that penalizes generated music containing
notes inconsistent with the key. By optimizing these alignment-based objectives
during the generation process, our model produces symbolic music that is more
closely tied to the input captions, thereby improving the overall quality and
coherence of the generated compositions. Our approach can extend any existing
autoregressive model without requiring further training or fine-tuning. We
evaluate our work on top of Text2midi - an existing text-to-midi generation
model, demonstrating significant improvements in both objective and subjective
evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 研究为GeoS2L生成奠定了基础，并强调了地理知识在多模态生成模型中的重要性。

Abstract: We present a novel and practically significant problem-Geo-Contextual
Soundscape-to-Landscape (GeoS2L) generation-which aims to synthesize
geographically realistic landscape images from environmental soundscapes. Prior
audio-to-image generation methods typically rely on general-purpose datasets
and overlook geographic and environmental contexts, resulting in unrealistic
images that are misaligned with real-world environmental settings. To address
this limitation, we introduce a novel geo-contextual computational framework
that explicitly integrates geographic knowledge into multimodal generative
modeling. We construct two large-scale geo-contextual multimodal datasets,
SoundingSVI and SonicUrban, pairing diverse soundscapes with real-world
landscape images. We propose SounDiT, a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based
model that incorporates geo-contextual scene conditioning to synthesize
geographically coherent landscape images. Furthermore, we propose a
practically-informed geo-contextual evaluation framework, the Place Similarity
Score (PSS), across element-, scene-, and human perception-levels to measure
consistency between input soundscapes and generated landscape images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SounDiT outperforms existing baselines in both
visual fidelity and geographic settings. Our work not only establishes
foundational benchmarks for GeoS2L generation but also highlights the
importance of incorporating geographic domain knowledge in advancing multimodal
generative models, opening new directions at the intersection of generative AI,
geography, urban planning, and environmental sciences.

Abstract: Malware are malicious programs that are grouped into families based on their
penetration technique, source code, and other characteristics. Classifying
malware programs into their respective families is essential for building
effective defenses against cyber threats. Machine learning models have a huge
potential in malware detection on mobile devices, as malware families can be
recognized by classifying permission data extracted from Android manifest
files. Still, the malware classification task is challenging due to the
high-dimensional nature of permission data and the limited availability of
training samples. In particular, the steady emergence of new malware families
makes it impossible to acquire a comprehensive training set covering all the
malware classes. In this work, we present a malware classification system that,
on top of classifying known malware, detects new ones. In particular, we
combine an open-set recognition technique developed within the computer vision
community, namely MaxLogit, with a tree-based Gradient Boosting classifier,
which is particularly effective in classifying high-dimensional data. Our
solution turns out to be very practical, as it can be seamlessly employed in a
standard classification workflow, and efficient, as it adds minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on public and proprietary datasets
demonstrate the potential of our solution, which has been deployed in a
business environment.

Conclusion: Chaos为边缘分布式训练提供了高效、弹性和自管理的解决方案。

Abstract: Frequent node and link changes in edge AI clusters disrupt distributed
training, while traditional checkpoint-based recovery and cloud-centric
autoscaling are too slow for scale-out and ill-suited to chaotic and
self-governed edge. This paper proposes Chaos, a resilient and scalable edge
distributed training system with built-in self-healing and autoscaling. It
speeds up scale-out by using multi-neighbor replication with fast shard
scheduling, allowing a new node to pull the latest training state from nearby
neighbors in parallel while balancing the traffic load between them. It also
uses a cluster monitor to track resource and topology changes to assist
scheduler decisions, and handles scaling events through peer negotiation
protocols, enabling fully self-governed autoscaling without a central admin.
Extensive experiments show that Chaos consistently achieves much lower
scale-out delays than Pollux, EDL, and Autoscaling, and handles scale-in,
connect-link, and disconnect-link events within 1 millisecond, making it
smoother to handle node joins, exits, and failures. It also delivers the lowest
idle time, showing superior resource use and scalability as the cluster grows.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer superior modeling capabilities for social networks,
particularly in capturing group phenomena that extend beyond pairwise
interactions in rumor propagation. Existing approaches in rumor source
detection predominantly focus on dyadic interactions, which inadequately
address the complexity of more intricate relational structures. In this study,
we present a novel approach for Source Detection in Hypergraphs (HyperDet) via
Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion.
Specifically, our methodology employs an Interactive Relationship Construction
module to accurately model both the static topology and dynamic interactions
among users, followed by the Feature-rich Attention Fusion module, which
autonomously learns node features and discriminates between nodes using a
self-attention mechanism, thereby effectively learning node representations
under the framework of accurately modeled higher-order relationships. Extensive
experimental validation confirms the efficacy of our HyperDet approach,

Conclusion: 无监督方法在水下声学分析任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: The increasing level of sound pollution in marine environments poses an
increased threat to ocean health, making it crucial to monitor underwater
noise. By monitoring this noise, the sources responsible for this pollution can
be mapped. Monitoring is performed by passively listening to these sounds. This
generates a large amount of data records, capturing a mix of sound sources such
as ship activities and marine mammal vocalizations. Although machine learning
offers a promising solution for automatic sound classification, current
state-of-the-art methods implement supervised learning. This requires a large
amount of high-quality labeled data that is not publicly available. In
contrast, a massive amount of lower-quality unlabeled data is publicly
available, offering the opportunity to explore unsupervised learning
techniques. This research explores this possibility by implementing an
unsupervised Contrastive Learning approach. Here, a Conformer-based encoder is
optimized by the so-called Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization loss
function on these lower-quality unlabeled data and the translation to the
labeled data is made. Through classification tasks involving recognizing ship
types and marine mammal vocalizations, our method demonstrates to produce
robust and generalized embeddings. This shows to potential of unsupervised
methods for various automatic underwater acoustic analysis tasks.

Conclusion: TFACM在因果语音分离中表现优异，复杂度低。

Abstract: Existing causal speech separation models often underperform compared to
non-causal models due to difficulties in retaining historical information. To
address this, we propose the Time-Frequency Attention Cache Memory (TFACM)
model, which effectively captures spatio-temporal relationships through an
attention mechanism and cache memory (CM) for historical information storage.
In TFACM, an LSTM layer captures frequency-relative positions, while causal
modeling is applied to the time dimension using local and global
representations. The CM module stores past information, and the causal
attention refinement (CAR) module further enhances time-based feature
representations for finer granularity. Experimental results showed that TFACM
achieveed comparable performance to the SOTA TF-GridNet-Causal model, with
significantly lower complexity and fewer trainable parameters. For more

Abstract: Providing personalized, detailed feedback at scale in large undergraduate
STEM courses remains a persistent challenge. We present an empirically
evaluated practice exam system that integrates AI generated feedback with
targeted textbook references, deployed in a large introductory biology course.
Our system encourages metacognitive behavior by asking students to explain
their answers and declare their confidence. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4o to generate
personalized feedback based on this information, while directing them to
relevant textbook sections. Through interaction logs from consenting
participants across three midterms (541, 342, and 413 students respectively),
totaling 28,313 question-student interactions across 146 learning objectives,
along with 279 surveys and 23 interviews, we examined the system's impact on
learning outcomes and engagement. Across all midterms, feedback types showed no
statistically significant performance differences, though some trends suggested
potential benefits. The most substantial impact came from the required
confidence ratings and explanations, which students reported transferring to
their actual exam strategies. About 40 percent of students engaged with
textbook references when prompted by feedback -- far higher than traditional
reading rates. Survey data revealed high satisfaction (mean rating 4.1 of 5),
with 82.1 percent reporting increased confidence on practiced midterm topics,
and 73.4 percent indicating they could recall and apply specific concepts. Our
findings suggest that embedding structured reflection requirements may be more
impactful than sophisticated feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: This article explores the use of artificial intelligence for the diagnosis of

the accuracy and speed of diagnosis in medical institutions. During the study,
the existing solutions (Diagnocat, MandSeg) were analyzed, which, as a result,
are not suitable for studying the articular disc due to the orientation towards
bone structures. To solve the problem, an original dataset was collected from
94 images with the classes "temporomandibular joint" and "jaw". To increase the
amount of data, augmentation methods were used. After that, the models of
U-Net, YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n and Roboflow neural networks were trained and
compared. The evaluation was carried out according to the Dice Score,
Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Mean Average Precision metrics. The
results confirm the potential of using the Roboflow model for segmentation of
the temporomandibular joint. In the future, it is planned to develop an
algorithm for measuring the distance between the jaws and determining the

scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high
dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from
over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological
information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering
framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps:
(1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations
to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance
representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines
cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex
cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal
Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align
cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance.
Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate
that~\methodname~outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell
clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a
powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.

Abstract: Air travel is one of the most widely used transportation services in the
United States. This paper analyzes the U.S. Flight Network (USFN) using complex
network theory by exploring how the network's topology contributes to its
efficiency and vulnerability. This is done by examining the structural
properties, degree distributions, and community structures in the network. USFN
was observed to follow power-law distribution and falls under the anomalous
regime, suggesting that the network is hub dominant. Compared to null networks,
USFN has a higher clustering coefficient and modularity. Various percolation
test revealed that USFN is vulnerable to targeted attacks and is susceptible to
complete cascading failure if one of the major hubs fails. The overall results
suggest that while the USFN is designed for efficiency, it is highly vulnerable
to disruptions. Protecting key hub airports is important to make the network
more robust and prevent large-scale failures.

Conclusion: 通过响应多样性改进GRPO，提升了LLM的强化学习能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant success in enhancing
reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). One of the most widely
used RL methods is Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)~\cite{Shao-2024-Deepseekmath}, known for its memory efficiency and
success in training DeepSeek-R1~\cite{Guo-2025-Deepseek}. However, GRPO stalls
when all sampled responses in a group are incorrect -- referred to as an
\emph{all-negative-sample} group -- as it fails to update the policy, hindering
learning progress. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we
propose a simple yet effective framework that introduces response diversity
within all-negative-sample groups in GRPO using AI feedback. We also provide a
theoretical analysis, via a stylized model, showing how this diversification
improves learning dynamics. Second, we empirically validate our approach,
showing the improved performance across various model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in
both offline and online learning settings with 10 benchmarks, including base
and distilled variants. Our findings highlight that learning from
all-negative-sample groups is not only feasible but beneficial, advancing
recent insights from \citet{Xiong-2025-Minimalist}.

Conclusion: 自校正框架有效提升了语言模型的推理准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has advanced the capabilities and
transparency of language models (LMs); however, reasoning chains can contain
inaccurate statements that reduce performance and trustworthiness. To address
this, we introduce a new self-correction framework that augments each reasoning
step in a CoT with a latent variable indicating its veracity, enabling modeling
of all possible truth assignments rather than assuming correctness throughout.
To efficiently explore this expanded space, we introduce Search Corrector, a
discrete search algorithm over boolean-valued veracity assignments. It
efficiently performs otherwise intractable inference in the posterior
distribution over veracity assignments by leveraging the LM's joint likelihood
over veracity and the final answer as a proxy reward. This efficient
inference-time correction method facilitates supervised fine-tuning of an
Amortized Corrector by providing pseudo-labels for veracity. The Amortized
Corrector generalizes self-correction, enabling accurate zero-shot veracity
inference in novel contexts. Empirical results demonstrate that Search
Corrector reliably identifies errors in logical (ProntoQA) and mathematical
reasoning (GSM8K) benchmarks. The Amortized Corrector achieves comparable
zero-shot accuracy and improves final answer accuracy by up to 25%.

Conclusion: AdaCoT有效平衡了性能与计算成本，适用于复杂推理任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
often face challenges with tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances reasoning, it
indiscriminately generates lengthy reasoning steps for all queries, leading to
substantial computational costs and inefficiency, especially for simpler
inputs. To address this critical issue, we introduce AdaCoT (Adaptive
Chain-of-Thought), a novel framework enabling LLMs to adaptively decide when to
invoke CoT. AdaCoT framed adaptive reasoning as a Pareto optimization problem
that seeks to balance model performance with the costs associated with CoT
invocation (both frequency and computational overhead). We propose a
reinforcement learning (RL) based method, specifically utilizing Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), to dynamically control the CoT triggering decision
boundary by adjusting penalty coefficients, thereby allowing the model to
determine CoT necessity based on implicit query complexity. A key technical
contribution is Selective Loss Masking (SLM), designed to counteract decision
boundary collapse during multi-stage RL training, ensuring robust and stable
adaptive triggering. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaCoT successfully
navigates the Pareto frontier, achieving substantial reductions in CoT usage
for queries not requiring elaborate reasoning. For instance, on our production
traffic testset, AdaCoT reduced CoT triggering rates to as low as 3.18\% and
decreased average response tokens by 69.06%, while maintaining high performance
on complex tasks.

Abstract: High-quality reward models are crucial for unlocking the reasoning potential
of large language models (LLMs), with best-of-N voting demonstrating
significant performance gains. However, current reward models, which typically
operate on the textual output of LLMs, are computationally expensive and
parameter-heavy, limiting their real-world applications. We introduce the
Efficient Linear Hidden State Reward (ELHSR) model - a novel, highly
parameter-efficient approach that leverages the rich information embedded in
LLM hidden states to address these issues. ELHSR systematically outperform
baselines with less than 0.005% of the parameters of baselines, requiring only
a few samples for training. ELHSR also achieves orders-of-magnitude efficiency
improvement with significantly less time and fewer FLOPs per sample than
baseline reward models. Moreover, ELHSR exhibits robust performance even when
trained only on logits, extending its applicability to some closed-source LLMs.
In addition, ELHSR can also be combined with traditional reward models to
achieve additional performance gains.

Abstract: Scaling RL for LLMs is computationally expensive, largely due to
multi-sampling for policy optimization and evaluation, making efficient data
selection crucial. Inspired by the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory,
we hypothesize LLMs learn best from data within their potential comprehension
zone. Addressing the limitation of conventional, computationally intensive
multi-sampling methods for data assessment, we introduce UFO-RL. This novel
framework uses a computationally efficient single-pass uncertainty estimation
to identify informative data instances, achieving up to 185x faster data
evaluation. UFO-RL leverages this metric to select data within the estimated
ZPD for training. Experiments show that training with just 10% of data selected
by UFO-RL yields performance comparable to or surpassing full-data training,
reducing overall training time by up to 16x while enhancing stability and
generalization. UFO-RL offers a practical and highly efficient strategy for
scaling RL fine-tuning of LLMs by focusing learning on valuable data.

Conclusion: Fractured Sampling为LLM推理提供了更高效和可扩展的解决方案，通过优化计算分配最大化性能。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling techniques have significantly bolstered the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by harnessing additional
computational effort at inference without retraining. Similarly,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its extension, Long CoT, improve accuracy
by generating rich intermediate reasoning trajectories, but these approaches
incur substantial token costs that impede their deployment in latency-sensitive
settings. In this work, we first show that truncated CoT, which stops reasoning
before completion and directly generates the final answer, often matches full
CoT sampling while using dramatically fewer tokens. Building on this insight,
we introduce Fractured Sampling, a unified inference-time strategy that
interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three orthogonal
axes: (1) the number of reasoning trajectories, (2) the number of final
solutions per trajectory, and (3) the depth at which reasoning traces are
truncated. Through extensive experiments on five diverse reasoning benchmarks
and several model scales, we demonstrate that Fractured Sampling consistently
achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, yielding steep log-linear scaling
gains in Pass@k versus token budget. Our analysis reveals how to allocate
computation across these dimensions to maximize performance, paving the way for
more efficient and scalable LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding
context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long
contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache
whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression
methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur
considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant
efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization
framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the
algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV
selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with
fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs
hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data
transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve
efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy
across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup
compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

Abstract: Inference scaling further accelerates Large Language Models (LLMs) toward
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), with large-scale Reinforcement Learning
(RL) to unleash long Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Most contemporary reasoning
approaches usually rely on handcrafted rule-based reward functions. However,
the tarde-offs of exploration and exploitation in RL algorithms involves
multiple complex considerations, and the theoretical and empirical impacts of
manually designed reward functions remain insufficiently explored. In this
paper, we propose Decoupled Group Reward Optimization (DGRO), a general RL
algorithm for LLM reasoning. On the one hand, DGRO decouples the traditional
regularization coefficient into two independent hyperparameters: one scales the
policy gradient term, and the other regulates the distance from the sampling
policy. This decoupling not only enables precise control over balancing
exploration and exploitation, but also can be seamlessly extended to Online
Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) algorithms in Kimi k1.5 and Direct Reward
Optimization. On the other hand, we observe that reward variance significantly
affects both convergence speed and final model performance. We conduct both
theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation to assess DGRO,
including a detailed ablation study that investigates its performance and
optimization dynamics. Experimental results show that DGRO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Logic dataset with an average accuracy of
96.9\%, and demonstrates strong generalization across mathematical benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at mathematical reasoning and logical
problem-solving. The current popular training paradigms primarily use
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
models' reasoning abilities. However, when using SFT or RL alone, there are
respective challenges: SFT may suffer from overfitting, while RL is prone to
mode collapse. The state-of-the-art methods have proposed hybrid training
schemes. However, static switching faces challenges such as poor generalization
across different tasks and high dependence on data quality. In response to
these challenges, inspired by the curriculum learning-quiz mechanism in human
reasoning cultivation, We propose SASR, a step-wise adaptive hybrid training
framework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL and dynamically balances the
two throughout optimization. SASR uses SFT for initial warm-up to establish
basic reasoning skills, and then uses an adaptive dynamic adjustment algorithm
based on gradient norm and divergence relative to the original distribution to
seamlessly integrate SFT with the online RL method GRPO. By monitoring the
training status of LLMs and adjusting the training process in sequence, SASR
ensures a smooth transition between training schemes, maintaining core
reasoning abilities while exploring different paths. Experimental results
demonstrate that SASR outperforms SFT, RL, and static hybrid training methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, MATH, and AIME. However, the
substantial computational demands of these tasks pose significant challenges
for real-world deployment. Model quantization has emerged as a promising
approach to reduce memory footprint and inference latency by representing
weights and activations with lower bit-widths. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive study of mainstream quantization methods(e.g., AWQ, GPTQ,
SmoothQuant) on the most popular open-sourced models (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3
series), and reveal that quantization can degrade mathematical reasoning
accuracy by up to 69.81%. To better understand this degradation, we develop an
automated assignment and judgment pipeline that qualitatively categorizes
failures into four error types and quantitatively identifies the most impacted
reasoning capabilities. Building on these findings, we employ an automated
data-curation pipeline to construct a compact "Silver Bullet" datasets.
Training a quantized model on as few as 332 carefully selected examples for
just 3-5 minutes on a single GPU is enough to restore its reasoning accuracy to
match that of the full-precision baseline.

of understanding their internal workings. We propose a different perspective
that challenges the prevailing view: rather than being inscrutable, neural
networks exhibit patterns in their raw population activity that mirror
regularities in the training data. We refer to this as the Reflection
Hypothesis and provide evidence for this phenomenon in both simple recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) and complex large language models (LLMs). Building on
this insight, we propose to leverage cognitively-inspired methods of chunking
to segment high-dimensional neural population dynamics into interpretable units
that reflect underlying concepts. We propose three methods to extract these
emerging entities, complementing each other based on label availability and
dimensionality. Discrete sequence chunking (DSC) creates a dictionary of
entities; population averaging (PA) extracts recurring entities that correspond
to known labels; and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD) can be used when labels
are absent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in extracting
entities across varying model sizes, ranging from inducing compositionality in
RNNs to uncovering recurring neural population states in large models with
diverse architectures, and illustrate their advantage over other methods.
Throughout, we observe a robust correspondence between the extracted entities
and concrete or abstract concepts. Artificially inducing the extracted entities
in neural populations effectively alters the network's generation of associated
concepts. Our work points to a new direction for interpretability, one that
harnesses both cognitive principles and the structure of naturalistic data to
reveal the hidden computations of complex learning systems, gradually
transforming them from black boxes into systems we can begin to understand.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种方法提升注意力机制效率：利用FP4 Tensor Cores加速推理，并首次将低比特注意力应用于训练任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力机制的二次时间复杂度限制了其效率，尤其是在大规模模型训练和推理中。

Method: 1. 利用Blackwell GPUs的FP4 Tensor Cores加速注意力计算；2. 设计8-bit注意力机制用于训练任务。

Result: FP4注意力在RTX5090上实现5倍加速，8-bit注意力在微调任务中无损性能，但在预训练任务中收敛较慢。

Conclusion: 低比特注意力在推理和训练中均具潜力，但预训练任务需进一步优化。

Abstract: The efficiency of attention is important due to its quadratic time
complexity. We enhance the efficiency of attention through two key
contributions: First, we leverage the new FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell GPUs to
accelerate attention computation. Our implementation achieves 1038 TOPS on
RTX5090, which is a 5x speedup over the fastest FlashAttention on RTX5090.
Experiments show that our FP4 attention can accelerate inference of various
models in a plug-and-play way. Second, we pioneer low-bit attention to training
tasks. Existing low-bit attention works like FlashAttention3 and SageAttention
focus only on inference. However, the efficiency of training large models is
also important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied
to training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both
forward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention
achieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower
convergence in pretraining tasks. The code will be available at

Motivation: 现有贝叶斯方法在推理时需要多次采样，效率低下，限制了实际部署。

Method: 将贝叶斯LLM的预测分布蒸馏到非贝叶斯学生LLM中，仅需训练数据，无需额外验证集。

Result: 实现了N倍效率提升（N为传统贝叶斯LLM所需采样次数），且在测试数据上表现优于或媲美现有贝叶斯LLM。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，为LLM不确定性估计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in uncertainty estimation for Large Language Models (LLMs)
during downstream adaptation have addressed key challenges of reliability and
simplicity. However, existing Bayesian methods typically require multiple
sampling iterations during inference, creating significant efficiency issues
that limit practical deployment. In this paper, we investigate the possibility
of eliminating the need for test-time sampling for LLM uncertainty estimation.
Specifically, when given an off-the-shelf Bayesian LLM, we distill its aligned
confidence into a non-Bayesian student LLM by minimizing the divergence between
their predictive distributions. Unlike typical calibration methods, our
distillation is carried out solely on the training dataset without the need of
an additional validation dataset. This simple yet effective approach achieves
N-times more efficient uncertainty estimation during testing, where N is the
number of samples traditionally required by Bayesian LLMs. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that uncertainty estimation capabilities on training
data can successfully generalize to unseen test data through our distillation
technique, consistently producing results comparable to (or even better than)
state-of-the-art Bayesian LLMs.

Motivation: LLM的输出质量在不同场景下不一致，尤其在复杂任务中难以识别可信响应，因此需要一种方法评估和改进生成质量。

Conclusion: 有效的token级不确定性估计是评估和改进LLM推理生成的有价值工具。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities,
their output quality remains inconsistent across various application scenarios,
making it difficult to identify trustworthy responses, especially in complex
tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a token-level
uncertainty estimation framework to enable LLMs to self-assess and self-improve
their generation quality in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we introduce
low-rank random weight perturbation to LLM decoding, generating predictive
distributions that we use to estimate token-level uncertainties. We then
aggregate these uncertainties to reflect semantic uncertainty of the generated
sequences. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets of varying difficulty
demonstrate that our token-level uncertainty metrics strongly correlate with
answer correctness and model robustness. Additionally, we explore using
uncertainty to directly enhance the model's reasoning performance through
multiple generations and the particle filtering algorithm. Our approach
consistently outperforms existing uncertainty estimation methods, establishing
effective uncertainty estimation as a valuable tool for both evaluating and
improving reasoning generation in LLMs.

Method: 理论分析玩具模型和实验验证LLM SAEs中的特征对冲现象，提出改进的Matryoshka SAEs变体。

Result: 特征对冲是SAEs表现不佳的核心原因之一，改进的Matryoshka SAEs有望提升性能。

Conclusion: SAEs仍存在根本问题，但揭示特征对冲现象有助于未来改进，以实现LLM的大规模解释。

Abstract: It is assumed that sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose polysemantic
activations into interpretable linear directions, as long as the activations
are composed of sparse linear combinations of underlying features. However, we
find that if an SAE is more narrow than the number of underlying "true
features" on which it is trained, and there is correlation between features,
the SAE will merge components of correlated features together, thus destroying
monosemanticity. In LLM SAEs, these two conditions are almost certainly true.
This phenomenon, which we call feature hedging, is caused by SAE reconstruction
loss, and is more severe the narrower the SAE. In this work, we introduce the
problem of feature hedging and study it both theoretically in toy models and
empirically in SAEs trained on LLMs. We suspect that feature hedging may be one
of the core reasons that SAEs consistently underperform supervised baselines.
Finally, we use our understanding of feature hedging to propose an improved
variant of matryoshka SAEs. Our work shows there remain fundamental issues with
SAEs, but we are hopeful that that highlighting feature hedging will catalyze
future advances that allow SAEs to achieve their full potential of interpreting
LLMs at scale.

Conclusion: 因果分析在语言模型行为预测中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Interpretability research now offers a variety of techniques for identifying
abstract internal mechanisms in neural networks. Can such techniques be used to
predict how models will behave on out-of-distribution examples? In this work,
we provide a positive answer to this question. Through a diverse set of
language modeling tasks--including symbol manipulation, knowledge retrieval,
and instruction following--we show that the most robust features for
correctness prediction are those that play a distinctive causal role in the
model's behavior. Specifically, we propose two methods that leverage causal
mechanisms to predict the correctness of model outputs: counterfactual
simulation (checking whether key causal variables are realized) and value
probing (using the values of those variables to make predictions). Both achieve
high AUC-ROC in distribution and outperform methods that rely on
causal-agnostic features in out-of-distribution settings, where predicting
model behaviors is more crucial. Our work thus highlights a novel and
significant application for internal causal analysis of language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in mathematical
problem-solving, but evaluation has largely focused on problems that have exact
analytical solutions or involve formal proofs, often overlooking
approximation-based problems ubiquitous in applied science and engineering. To
fill this gap, we build on prior work and present HARDMath2, a dataset of 211
original problems covering the core topics in an introductory graduate applied
math class, including boundary-layer analysis, WKB methods, asymptotic
solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations, and the asymptotics of
oscillatory integrals. This dataset was designed and verified by the students
and instructors of a core graduate applied mathematics course at Harvard. We
build the dataset through a novel collaborative environment that challenges
students to write and refine difficult problems consistent with the class
syllabus, peer-validate solutions, test different models, and automatically
check LLM-generated solutions against their own answers and numerical ground
truths. Evaluation results show that leading frontier models still struggle
with many of the problems in the dataset, highlighting a gap in the
mathematical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Importantly, students identified
strategies to create increasingly difficult problems by interacting with the
models and exploiting common failure modes. This back-and-forth with the models
not only resulted in a richer and more challenging benchmark but also led to
qualitative improvements in the students' understanding of the course material,
which is increasingly important as we enter an age where state-of-the-art
language models can solve many challenging problems across a wide domain of
fields.

Result: 教师模型更保护成员数据，学生模型更保护非成员数据。提出的蒸馏方法显著降低学生模型对MIA的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在隐私保护方面存在差异，提出的方法可增强学生模型的隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on huge datasets, some
including sensitive information. This poses a serious privacy concern because
privacy attacks such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) may detect this
sensitive information. While knowledge distillation compresses LLMs into
efficient, smaller student models, its impact on privacy remains underexplored.
In this paper, we investigate how knowledge distillation affects model
robustness against MIA. We focus on two questions. First, how is private data
protected in teacher and student models? Second, how can we strengthen privacy
preservation against MIAs in knowledge distillation? Through comprehensive
experiments, we show that while teacher and student models achieve similar
overall MIA accuracy, teacher models better protect member data, the primary
target of MIA, whereas student models better protect non-member data. To
address this vulnerability in student models, we propose 5 privacy-preserving
distillation methods and demonstrate that they successfully reduce student
models' vulnerability to MIA, with ensembling further stabilizing the
robustness, offering a reliable approach for distilling more secure and
efficient student models. Our implementation source code is available at

Abstract: As generative agents become increasingly capable, alignment of their behavior
with complex human values remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches
often simplify human intent through reduction to a scalar reward, overlooking
the multi-faceted nature of human feedback. In this work, we introduce a
theoretical framework for preference-based Multi-Objective Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL), where human preferences are modeled as latent
vector-valued reward functions. We formalize the problem of recovering a
Pareto-optimal reward representation from noisy preference queries and
establish conditions for identifying the underlying multi-objective structure.
We derive tight sample complexity bounds for recovering
$\epsilon$-approximations of the Pareto front and introduce a regret
formulation to quantify suboptimality in this multi-objective setting.
Furthermore, we propose a provably convergent algorithm for policy optimization
using preference-inferred reward cones. Our results bridge the gap between
practical alignment techniques and theoretical guarantees, providing a
principled foundation for learning aligned behaviors in a high-dimension and
value-pluralistic environment.

Abstract: Loss reweighting has shown significant benefits for machine unlearning with
large language models (LLMs). However, their exact functionalities are left
unclear and the optimal strategy remains an open question, thus impeding the
understanding and improvement of existing methodologies. In this paper, we
identify two distinct goals of loss reweighting, namely, Saturation and
Importance -- the former indicates that those insufficiently optimized data
should be emphasized, while the latter stresses some critical data that are
most influential for loss minimization. To study their usefulness, we design
specific reweighting strategies for each goal and evaluate their respective
effects on unlearning. We conduct extensive empirical analyses on
well-established benchmarks, and summarize some important observations as
follows: (i) Saturation enhances efficacy more than importance-based
reweighting, and their combination can yield additional improvements. (ii)
Saturation typically allocates lower weights to data with lower likelihoods,
whereas importance-based reweighting does the opposite. (iii) The efficacy of
unlearning is also largely influenced by the smoothness and granularity of the
weight distributions. Based on these findings, we propose SatImp, a simple
reweighting method that combines the advantages of both saturation and
importance. Empirical results on extensive datasets validate the efficacy of
our method, potentially bridging existing research gaps and indicating
directions for future research. Our code is available at

Abstract: The current focus of AI research is shifting from emphasizing model training
towards enhancing evaluation quality, a transition that is crucial for driving
further advancements in AI systems. Traditional evaluation methods typically
rely on reward models assigning scalar preference scores to outputs. Although
effective, such approaches lack interpretability, leaving users often uncertain
about why a reward model rates a particular response as high or low. The advent
of LLM-as-a-Judge provides a more scalable and interpretable method of
supervision, offering insights into the decision-making process. Moreover, with
the emergence of large reasoning models, which consume more tokens for deeper
thinking and answer refinement, scaling test-time computation in the
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm presents an avenue for further boosting performance and
providing more interpretability through reasoning traces. In this paper, we
introduce $\textbf{J1-7B}$, which is first supervised fine-tuned on
reflection-enhanced datasets collected via rejection-sampling and subsequently
trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with verifiable rewards. At inference
time, we apply Simple Test-Time Scaling (STTS) strategies for additional
performance improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that $\textbf{J1-7B}$
surpasses the previous state-of-the-art LLM-as-a-Judge by $ \textbf{4.8}$\% and
exhibits a $ \textbf{5.1}$\% stronger scaling trend under STTS. Additionally,
we present three key findings: (1) Existing LLM-as-a-Judge does not inherently
exhibit such scaling trend. (2) Model simply fine-tuned on reflection-enhanced
datasets continues to demonstrate similarly weak scaling behavior. (3)
Significant scaling trend emerges primarily during the RL phase, suggesting
that effective STTS capability is acquired predominantly through RL training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential as general-purpose AI
assistants across various domains. To fully leverage this potential in specific
applications, many companies provide fine-tuning API services, enabling users
to upload their own data for LLM customization. However, fine-tuning services
introduce a new safety threat: user-uploaded data, whether harmful or benign,
can break the model's alignment, leading to unsafe outputs. Moreover, existing
defense methods struggle to address the diversity of fine-tuning datasets
(e.g., varying sizes, tasks), often sacrificing utility for safety or vice
versa. To address this issue, we propose Safe Delta, a safety-aware
post-training defense method that adjusts the delta parameters (i.e., the
parameter change before and after fine-tuning). Specifically, Safe Delta
estimates the safety degradation, selects delta parameters to maximize utility
while limiting overall safety loss, and applies a safety compensation vector to
mitigate residual safety loss. Through extensive experiments on four diverse
datasets with varying settings, our approach consistently preserves safety
while ensuring that the utility gain from benign datasets remains unaffected.

Abstract: Continual model merging integrates independently fine-tuned models
sequentially without access to original training data, providing a scalable and
efficient solution to continual learning. However, current methods still face
critical challenges, notably parameter interference among tasks and limited
adaptability to evolving test distributions. The former causes catastrophic
forgetting of integrated tasks, while the latter hinders effective adaptation
to new tasks. To address these, we propose MINGLE, a novel framework for
test-time continual model merging, which leverages test-time adaptation using a
small set of unlabeled test samples from the current task to dynamically guide
the merging process. MINGLE employs a mixture-of-experts architecture composed
of parameter-efficient, low-rank experts, enabling efficient adaptation and
improving robustness to distribution shifts. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, we propose Null-Space Constrained Gating, which restricts gating
updates to subspaces orthogonal to prior task representations. This suppresses
activations on old task inputs and preserves model behavior on past tasks. To
further balance stability and adaptability, we design an Adaptive Relaxation
Strategy, which dynamically adjusts the constraint strength based on
interference signals captured during test-time adaptation. Extensive
experiments on standard continual merging benchmarks demonstrate that MINGLE
achieves robust generalization, reduces forgetting significantly, and
consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by 7-9\% on average
across diverse task orders.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with auxiliary tokens has emerged as
a promising strategy for enhancing model performance. In this work, we
introduce a lightweight method termed latent tokens; these are dummy tokens
that may be non-interpretable in natural language but steer the autoregressive
decoding process of a Transformer-based LLM via the attention mechanism. The
proposed latent tokens can be seamlessly integrated with a pre-trained
Transformer, trained in a parameter-efficient manner, and applied flexibly at
inference time, while adding minimal complexity overhead to the existing
infrastructure of standard Transformers. We propose several hypotheses about
the underlying mechanisms of latent tokens and design synthetic tasks
accordingly to verify them. Numerical results confirm that the proposed method
noticeably outperforms the baselines, particularly in the out-of-distribution
generalization scenarios, highlighting its potential in improving the
adaptability of LLMs.

failure modes is important for both users and developers. We test o1-mini,
o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and Grok 3
Mini Beta on graph coloring as a variable-complexity constraint-satisfaction
logic problem, and find evidence from both error rate comparisons and
CoT/explanation text analysis that RLLMs are prone to hallucinate edges not
specified in the prompt's description of the graph. This phenomenon persists
across multiple problem complexity levels and semantic frames, and it appears
to account for a significant fraction of the incorrect answers from every
tested model, and the vast majority of them for some models. Our results
indicate that RLLMs may possess broader issues with misrepresentation of
problem specifics, and we offer suggestions for design choices to mitigate this
weakness.

Motivation: 解决跨模态模型重用中内部表示对齐的困难，减少对大量配对训练数据的依赖。

Method: 通过条件流匹配学习不同模态潜在空间之间的流，包括最优传输问题和基于标注样本的高效对齐。

Result: 在MNIST、ImageNet等数据集上，下游任务性能与端到端训练模型相当，尤其在标注数据稀缺时表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨模态模型对齐提供了一种数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across modalities
such as language and vision. However, model reuse across distinct modalities
(e.g., text and vision) remains limited due to the difficulty of aligning
internal representations. Existing methods require extensive paired training
data or are constrained to specific domains. We introduce a semi-supervised
approach for model alignment via conditional flow matching. The conditional
flow between latent spaces of different modalities (e.g., text-to-image or
biological-to-artificial neuronal activity) can be learned in two settings:
($1$) solving a (balanced or unbalanced) optimal transport problem with an
inter-space bridge cost, and ($2$) performing memory-efficient alignment using
labelled exemplars. Despite being constrained by the original models' capacity,
our method--under both settings--matches downstream task performance of
end-to-end trained models on object recognition and image generation tasks
across MNIST, ImageNet, and \cite{majaj2015simple} datasets, particularly when
labelled training data is scarce ($<20\%$). Our method provides a
data-efficient solution for inter-modal model alignment with minimal
supervision.

Method: SEAM通过新型损失函数和对抗梯度上升技术，使模型在合法任务中保持性能，但在有害数据微调时性能崩溃。

Result: SEAM在低强度攻击下表现出卓越鲁棒性，而在高强度攻击下性能崩溃，使模型无法使用。

Conclusion: SEAM为LLMs提供了一种有效的对抗有害微调攻击的防御机制。

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning attacks pose a major threat to the security of large
language models (LLMs), allowing adversaries to compromise safety guardrails
with minimal harmful data. While existing defenses attempt to reinforce LLM
alignment, they fail to address models' inherent "trainability" on harmful
data, leaving them vulnerable to stronger attacks with increased learning rates
or larger harmful datasets. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce
SEAM, a novel alignment-enhancing defense that transforms LLMs into
self-destructive models with intrinsic resilience to misalignment attempts.
Specifically, these models retain their capabilities for legitimate tasks while
exhibiting substantial performance degradation when fine-tuned on harmful data.
The protection is achieved through a novel loss function that couples the
optimization trajectories of benign and harmful data, enhanced with adversarial
gradient ascent to amplify the self-destructive effect. To enable practical
training, we develop an efficient Hessian-free gradient estimate with
theoretical error bounds. Extensive evaluation across LLMs and datasets
demonstrates that SEAM creates a no-win situation for adversaries: the
self-destructive models achieve state-of-the-art robustness against
low-intensity attacks and undergo catastrophic performance collapse under
high-intensity attacks, rendering them effectively unusable. (warning: this
paper contains potentially harmful content generated by LLMs.)

Result: 提出了三个关键发现以构建可靠基准，并发现过度优化的高相关性可能降低某些下游性能的相关性。

Conclusion: 设计基准时应将过度优化作为工具而非终极目标。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a crucial role in reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), aligning model behavior with human preferences. However,
existing benchmarks for reward models show a weak correlation with the
performance of optimized policies, suggesting that they fail to accurately
assess the true capabilities of RMs. To bridge this gap, we explore several
evaluation designs through the lens of reward overoptimization\textemdash a
phenomenon that captures both how well the reward model aligns with human
preferences and the dynamics of the learning signal it provides to the policy.
The results highlight three key findings on how to construct a reliable
benchmark: (i) it is important to minimize differences between chosen and
rejected responses beyond correctness, (ii) evaluating reward models requires
multiple comparisons across a wide range of chosen and rejected responses, and
(iii) given that reward models encounter responses with diverse
representations, responses should be sourced from a variety of models. However,
we also observe that a extremely high correlation with degree of
overoptimization leads to comparatively lower correlation with certain
downstream performance. Thus, when designing a benchmark, it is desirable to
use the degree of overoptimization as a useful tool, rather than the end goal.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
they remain susceptible to hallucinations-generating content that is
inconsistent with the input image. Existing training-free hallucination
mitigation methods often suffer from unstable performance and high sensitivity
to hyperparameter settings, limiting their practicality and broader adoption.
In this paper, we propose a novel decoding mechanism, Decoding with Inter-layer
Consistency via Layer Aggregation (DCLA), which requires no retraining,
fine-tuning, or access to external knowledge bases. Specifically, our approach
constructs a dynamic semantic reference by aggregating representations from
previous layers, and corrects semantically deviated layers to enforce
inter-layer consistency. The method allows DCLA to robustly mitigate
hallucinations across multiple LVLMs. Experiments on hallucination benchmarks
such as MME and POPE demonstrate that DCLA effectively reduces hallucinations
while enhancing the reliability and performance of LVLMs.

Abstract: Low rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) thanks to its superb efficiency gains
over previous methods. While extensive studies have examined the performance
and structural properties of LoRA, its behavior upon training-time attacks
remain underexplored, posing significant security risks. In this paper, we
theoretically investigate the security implications of LoRA's low-rank
structure during fine-tuning, in the context of its robustness against data
poisoning and backdoor attacks. We propose an analytical framework that models
LoRA's training dynamics, employs the neural tangent kernel to simplify the
analysis of the training process, and applies information theory to establish
connections between LoRA's low rank structure and its vulnerability against
training-time attacks. Our analysis indicates that LoRA exhibits better
robustness to backdoor attacks than full fine-tuning, while becomes more
vulnerable to untargeted data poisoning due to its over-simplified information
geometry. Extensive experimental evaluations have corroborated our theoretical
findings.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in improving the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the specific challenges of
adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain relatively unexplored. In
this work, we present Observe-R1, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We draw
inspirations from human learning progression--from simple to complex and easy
to difficult, and propose a gradual learning paradigm for MLLMs. To this end,
we construct the NeuraLadder dataset, which is organized and sampled according
to the difficulty and complexity of data samples for RL training. To tackle
multimodal tasks, we introduce a multimodal format constraint that encourages
careful observation of images, resulting in enhanced visual abilities and
clearer and more structured responses. Additionally, we implement a bonus
reward system that favors concise, correct answers within a length constraint,
alongside a dynamic weighting mechanism that prioritizes uncertain and
medium-difficulty problems, ensuring that more informative samples have a
greater impact on training. Our experiments with the Qwen2.5-VL-3B and
Qwen2.5-VL-7B models on 20k samples from the NeuraLadder dataset show that
Observe-R1 outperforms a series of larger reasoning models on both reasoning
and general benchmarks, achieving superior clarity and conciseness in reasoning
chains. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our strategies,
highlighting the robustness and generalization of our approach. The dataset and

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive abilities in numerous
domains, but exhibit inconsistent performance in response to minor input

novel method for leveraging models' inconsistency to boost Pass@k performance.
Specifically, we present a "Variator" agent that generates k variants of a
given task and submits one candidate solution for each one. Our variant
generation approach is applicable to a wide range of domains as it is task
agnostic and compatible with free-form inputs. We demonstrate the efficacy of
our agent theoretically using a probabilistic model of the inconsistency
effect, and show empirically that it outperforms the baseline on the APPS

Abstract: Reasoning ability, a core component of human intelligence, continues to pose
a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) in the pursuit of AGI.
Although model performance has improved under the training scaling law,
significant challenges remain, particularly with respect to training
algorithms, such as catastrophic forgetting, and the limited availability of
novel training data. As an alternative, test-time scaling enhances reasoning
performance by increasing test-time computation without parameter updating.
Unlike prior methods in this paradigm focused on token space, we propose
leveraging latent space for more effective reasoning and better adherence to
the test-time scaling law. We introduce LatentSeek, a novel framework that
enhances LLM reasoning through Test-Time Instance-level Adaptation (TTIA)
within the model's latent space. Specifically, LatentSeek leverages policy
gradient to iteratively update latent representations, guided by self-generated
reward signals. LatentSeek is evaluated on a range of reasoning benchmarks,
including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, across multiple LLM architectures.
Results show that LatentSeek consistently outperforms strong baselines, such as
Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning-based methods. Furthermore, our
analysis demonstrates that LatentSeek is highly efficient, typically converging
within a few iterations for problems of average complexity, while also
benefiting from additional iterations, thereby highlighting the potential of
test-time scaling in the latent space. These findings position LatentSeek as a
lightweight, scalable, and effective solution for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

Conclusion: QZO是一种高效的内存优化方法，适用于大语言模型的下游任务微调，显著降低了硬件需求。

Abstract: As the size of large language models grows exponentially, GPU memory has
become a bottleneck for adapting these models to downstream tasks. In this
paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing
memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a
unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states
using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing
weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize
memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from
bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to
quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete
weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization
and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized
Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a novel approach that perturbs the continuous
quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative
clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based
and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to
full-parameter fine-tuning in bfloat16, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by
more than 18$\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large within a single 24GB GPU.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities
of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically employ
reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end
of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance
under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to
optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency
and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To
achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled
token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the
optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces
verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more
effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking
and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward.
Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget
Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency
of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results
in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions,
enhancing both training and token efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce a universal policy wrapper for reinforcement learning agents

reinforcement learning algorithms that excel in performance but lack rigorous
safety assurances, our wrapper selectively switches between a high-performing
base policy -- derived from any existing RL method -- and a fallback policy
with known convergence properties. Base policy's value function supervises this
switching process, determining when the fallback policy should override the
base policy to ensure the system remains on a stable path. The analysis proves
that our wrapper inherits the fallback policy's goal-reaching guarantees while
preserving or improving upon the performance of the base policy. Notably, it
operates without needing additional system knowledge or online constrained
optimization, making it readily deployable across diverse reinforcement
learning architectures and tasks.

Abstract: The recent success and openness of DeepSeek-R1 have brought widespread
attention to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reinforcement
learning method for large reasoning models (LRMs). In this work, we analyze the
GRPO objective under a binary reward setting and reveal an inherent limitation
of question-level difficulty bias. We also identify a connection between GRPO
and traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by
these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization
(DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of
discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its
recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a
discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons
clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used
as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained
optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint, ensuring stable
training. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its
variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting
discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO
and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a
constrained optimization approach; (iii) it allows the incorporation of
advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a
significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated
answers during training. Our experiments on enhancing the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of SFT-finetuned models show that DisCO significantly
outperforms GRPO and its improved variants such as DAPO, achieving average
gains of 7\% over GRPO and 6\% over DAPO across six benchmark tasks for an 1.5B
model.

rejected rewards. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of our proposed

Abstract: Recent advances in rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly
improved the reasoning capability of language models (LMs) with rule-based
rewards. However, existing RL methods -- such as GRPO, REINFORCE++, and RLOO --
often suffer from training instability, where large policy updates and improper
clipping can lead to training collapse. To address this issue, we propose
Clipped Policy Gradient Optimization with Policy Drift (CPGD), a novel
algorithm designed to stabilize policy learning in LMs. CPGD introduces a
policy drift constraint based on KL divergence to dynamically regularize policy
updates, and leverages a clip mechanism on the logarithm of the ratio to
prevent excessive policy updates. We provide theoretical justification for CPGD
and demonstrate through empirical analysis that it mitigates the instability
observed in prior approaches. Furthermore, we show that CPGD significantly
improves performance while maintaining training stability. Our implementation
balances theoretical rigor with practical usability, offering a robust
alternative for RL in the post-training of LMs. We release our code at

Method: 通过预算友好模型采样生成忠实解释，并进行实证研究验证其有效性。

Result: 代理解释不仅忠实，还能在下游任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs提供了一种新的模型无关解释范式。

Abstract: With Large language models (LLMs) becoming increasingly prevalent in various
applications, the need for interpreting their predictions has become a critical
challenge. As LLMs vary in architecture and some are closed-sourced,
model-agnostic techniques show great promise without requiring access to the
model's internal parameters. However, existing model-agnostic techniques need
to invoke LLMs many times to gain sufficient samples for generating faithful
explanations, which leads to high economic costs. In this paper, we show that
it is practical to generate faithful explanations for large-scale LLMs by
sampling from some budget-friendly models through a series of empirical
studies. Moreover, we show that such proxy explanations also perform well on
downstream tasks. Our analysis provides a new paradigm of model-agnostic
explanation methods for LLMs, by including information from budget-friendly
models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great promise in domains like
healthcare and robotics but often struggles with adoption due to its lack of
interpretability. Counterfactual explanations, which address "what if"
scenarios, provide a promising avenue for understanding RL decisions but remain
underexplored for continuous action spaces. We propose a novel approach for
generating counterfactual explanations in continuous action RL by computing
alternative action sequences that improve outcomes while minimizing deviations
from the original sequence. Our approach leverages a distance metric for
continuous actions and accounts for constraints such as adhering to predefined
policies in specific states. Evaluations in two RL domains, Diabetes Control
and Lunar Lander, demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization
of our approach, enabling more interpretable and trustworthy RL applications.

<details>

Motivation: LoRA在结合DP-SGD时面临噪声放大问题，限制了模型表达能力。FedSVD旨在通过SVD重参数化减少噪声，同时保持模型适应性。

Method: FedSVD通过客户端优化B矩阵，服务器聚合B矩阵并利用SVD重参数化生成新的A和B矩阵，避免噪声放大。

Result: FedSVD在多种隐私设置和基准测试中表现优于基线方法，提升了稳定性和性能。

Conclusion: FedSVD通过SVD重参数化有效解决了LoRA在DP-SGD下的噪声问题，适用于联邦学习中的高效微调。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which introduces a product of two trainable
low-rank matrices into frozen pre-trained weights, is widely used for efficient
fine-tuning of language models in federated learning (FL). However, when
combined with differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), LoRA
faces substantial noise amplification: DP-SGD perturbs per-sample gradients,
and the matrix multiplication of the LoRA update ($BA$) intensifies this
effect. Freezing one matrix (e.g., $A$) reduces the noise but restricts model
expressiveness, often resulting in suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we
propose FedSVD, a simple yet effective method that introduces a global
reparameterization based on singular value decomposition (SVD). In our
approach, each client optimizes only the $B$ matrix and transmits it to the
server. The server aggregates the $B$ matrices, computes the product $BA$ using
the previous $A$, and refactorizes the result via SVD. This yields a new
adaptive $A$ composed of the orthonormal right singular vectors of $BA$, and an
updated $B$ containing the remaining SVD components. This reparameterization
avoids quadratic noise amplification, while allowing $A$ to better capture the
principal directions of the aggregate updates. Moreover, the orthonormal
structure of $A$ bounds the gradient norms of $B$ and preserves more signal
under DP-SGD, as confirmed by our theoretical analysis. As a result, FedSVD
consistently improves stability and performance across a variety of privacy
settings and benchmarks, outperforming relevant baselines under both private
and non-private regimes.

Motivation: RLHF中的奖励模型存在长度偏差问题，导致模型通过奖励黑客行为（如偏好长回答）而非真正对齐人类偏好。现有方法未能准确建模或有效缓解这种偏差。

Method: 1. 训练标准奖励模型（含长度偏差）；2. 使用轻量级拟合模型捕捉长度与奖励的非线性关系；3. 将学习到的关系整合到奖励模型中以去偏。

Result: FiMi-RM实现了更平衡的长度-奖励分布，提升了长度控制的胜率并减少了冗余，同时不影响性能。

Conclusion: FiMi-RM有效解决了RLHF中的长度偏差问题，为奖励模型的去偏提供了新方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on reward models to align
large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from
reward hacking, wherein policy learning exploits flaws in the trained reward
model to maximize reward scores without genuinely aligning with human
preferences. A significant example of such reward hacking is length bias, where
reward models usually favor longer responses irrespective of actual response
quality. Previous works on length bias have notable limitations, these
approaches either mitigate bias without characterizing the bias form, or simply
assume a linear length-reward relation. To accurately model the intricate
nature of length bias and facilitate more effective bias mitigation, we propose
FiMi-RM (Bias Fitting to Mitigate Length Bias of Reward Model in RLHF), a
framework that autonomously learns and corrects underlying bias patterns. Our
approach consists of three stages: First, we train a standard reward model
which inherently contains length bias. Next, we deploy a lightweight fitting
model to explicitly capture the non-linear relation between length and reward.
Finally, we incorporate this learned relation into the reward model to debias.
Experimental results demonstrate that FiMi-RM achieves a more balanced
length-reward distribution. Furthermore, when applied to alignment algorithms,
our debiased reward model improves length-controlled win rate and reduces
verbosity without compromising its performance.

Conclusion: 结论表明，未知未知状态可以被渐进且高效地发现和处理。

Abstract: An AI agent might surprisingly find she has reached an unknown state which
she has never been aware of -- an unknown unknown. We mathematically ground
this scenario in reinforcement learning: an agent, after taking an action
calculated from value functions $Q$ and $V$ defined on the {\it {aware
domain}}, reaches a state out of the domain. To enable the agent to handle this
scenario, we propose an {\it episodic Markov decision {process} with growing
awareness} (EMDP-GA) model, taking a new {\it noninformative value expansion}
(NIVE) approach to expand value functions to newly aware areas: when an agent
arrives at an unknown unknown, value functions $Q$ and $V$ whereon are
initialised by noninformative beliefs -- the averaged values on the aware
domain. This design is out of respect for the complete absence of knowledge in
the newly discovered state. The upper confidence bound momentum Q-learning is
then adapted to the growing awareness for training the EMDP-GA model. We prove
that (1) the regret of our approach is asymptotically consistent with the state
of the art (SOTA) without exposure to unknown unknowns in an extremely
uncertain environment, and (2) our computational complexity and space
complexity are comparable with the SOTA -- these collectively suggest that
though an unknown unknown is surprising, it will be asymptotically properly
discovered with decent speed and an affordable cost.

Result: 理论证明BLPO在多项式时间内收敛到局部强Stackelberg均衡点，实验显示其性能优于或与PPO相当。

Conclusion: BLPO通过双层优化框架和Nyström方法，有效提升了AC算法的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: The dependency of the actor on the critic in actor-critic (AC) reinforcement
learning means that AC can be characterized as a bilevel optimization (BLO)
problem, also called a Stackelberg game. This characterization motivates two
modifications to vanilla AC algorithms. First, the critic's update should be
nested to learn a best response to the actor's policy. Second, the actor should
update according to a hypergradient that takes changes in the critic's behavior
into account. Computing this hypergradient involves finding an inverse Hessian
vector product, a process that can be numerically unstable. We thus propose a
new algorithm, Bilevel Policy Optimization with Nystr\"om Hypergradients
(BLPO), which uses nesting to account for the nested structure of BLO, and
leverages the Nystr\"om method to compute the hypergradient. Theoretically, we
prove BLPO converges to (a point that satisfies the necessary conditions for) a
local strong Stackelberg equilibrium in polynomial time with high probability,
assuming a linear parametrization of the critic's objective. Empirically, we
demonstrate that BLPO performs on par with or better than PPO on a variety of
discrete and continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: EnvInjection是一种高效且实用的攻击方法，解决了现有攻击的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with
webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the
webpages. Environmental prompt injection attacks manipulate the environment to
induce the web agent to perform a specific, attacker-chosen action--referred to
as the target action. However, existing attacks suffer from limited
effectiveness or stealthiness, or are impractical in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose EnvInjection, a new attack that addresses these
limitations. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the
rendered webpage, which can be implemented by modifying the webpage's source
code. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the
perturbation induces the web agent to perform the target action. We formulate
the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key
challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values
and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate
gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to
approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the
reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple webpage
datasets shows that EnvInjection is highly effective and significantly
outperforms existing baselines.

Result: 实验表明，PAM-SGD算法在MNIST和LLM任务中表现优异，尤其是在样本效率和稀疏性方面。

Conclusion: SAEs在可解释性和精度之间存在权衡，PAM-SGD算法为SAEs的训练提供了理论和实践支持。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have received considerable recent attention as
tools for mechanistic interpretability, showing success at extracting
interpretable features even from very large LLMs. However, this research has
been largely empirical, and there have been recent doubts about the true
utility of SAEs. In this work, we seek to enhance the theoretical understanding
of SAEs, using the spline theory of deep learning. By situating SAEs in this
framework: we discover that SAEs generalise ``$k$-means autoencoders'' to be
piecewise affine, but sacrifice accuracy for interpretability vs. the optimal
``$k$-means-esque plus local principal component analysis (PCA)'' piecewise
affine autoencoder. We characterise the underlying geometry of (TopK) SAEs
using power diagrams. And we develop a novel proximal alternating method SGD
(PAM-SGD) algorithm for training SAEs, with both solid theoretical foundations
and promising empirical results in MNIST and LLM experiments, particularly in
sample efficiency and (in the LLM setting) improved sparsity of codes. All code

Abstract: The combinatorial structure of many real-world action spaces leads to

sets and models their dependencies via self-attention conditioned on the global
state. SAINT is permutation-invariant, sample-efficient, and compatible with
standard policy optimization algorithms. In 15 distinct combinatorial
environments across three task domains, including environments with nearly 17

Result: 实验表明，STAR在多种LVLM架构和基准测试中实现显著加速，同时性能保持甚至提升。

Conclusion: STAR通过全局视角的token剪枝，为LVLM的高效推理提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) leverage rich visual token
representations to achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks, these tokens
also introduce significant computational overhead during inference. Existing
training-free token pruning methods typically adopt a single-stage strategy,
focusing either on visual self-attention or visual-textual cross-attention.
However, such localized perspectives often overlook the broader information
flow across the model, leading to substantial performance degradation,
especially under high pruning ratios. In this work, we propose STAR (Stage-wise
Attention-guided token Reduction), a training-free, plug-and-play framework
that approaches token pruning from a global perspective. Instead of pruning at
a single point, STAR performs attention-guided reduction in two complementary
stages: an early-stage pruning based on visual self-attention to remove
redundant low-level features, and a later-stage pruning guided by cross-modal
attention to discard task-irrelevant tokens. This holistic approach allows STAR
to significantly reduce computational cost while better preserving
task-critical information. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLM
architectures and benchmarks show that STAR achieves strong acceleration while
maintaining comparable, and in some cases even improved performance.

Conclusion: ILQ有效平衡了OOD动作的评估与限制，提升了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning seeks to derive improved policies entirely
from historical data but often struggles with over-optimistic value estimates
for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. This issue is typically mitigated via
policy constraint or conservative value regularization methods. However, these
approaches may impose overly constraints or biased value estimates, potentially
limiting performance improvements. To balance exploitation and restriction, we
propose an Imagination-Limited Q-learning (ILQ) method, which aims to maintain
the optimism that OOD actions deserve within appropriate limits. Specifically,
we utilize the dynamics model to imagine OOD action-values, and then clip the
imagined values with the maximum behavior values. Such design maintains
reasonable evaluation of OOD actions to the furthest extent, while avoiding its
over-optimism. Theoretically, we prove the convergence of the proposed ILQ
under tabular Markov decision processes. Particularly, we demonstrate that the
error bound between estimated values and optimality values of OOD state-actions
possesses the same magnitude as that of in-distribution ones, thereby
indicating that the bias in value estimates is effectively mitigated.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range
of tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

Conclusion: 提出的工具集在持续学习中具有高效性和可扩展性，为未来模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Future deep learning models will be distinguished by systems that perpetually
learn through interaction, imagination, and cooperation, blurring the line
between training and inference. This makes continual learning a critical
challenge, as methods that efficiently maximize bidirectional transfer across
learning trajectories will be essential. Replay is on track to play a
foundational role in continual learning, allowing models to directly reconcile
new information with past knowledge. In practice, however, replay is quite
unscalable, doubling the cost of continual learning when applied naively.
Moreover, the continual learning literature has not fully synchronized with the
multi-task fine-tuning literature, having not fully integrated highly scalable
techniques like model merging and low rank adaptation into a replay-enabled
toolset that can produce a unified model in the face of many sequential tasks.
In this paper, we begin by applying and analyzing low rank adaptation in a
continual learning setting. Next, we introduce consolidation, a phasic approach
to replay which leads to up to 55\% less replay samples being needed for a
given performance target. Then, we propose sequential merging, an offshoot of
task arithmetic which is tailored to the continual learning setting and is
shown to work well in combination with replay. Finally, we demonstrate that the
developed strategies can operate synergistically, resulting in a highly
scalable toolset that outperforms standalone variants.

answering when they are uncertain. Our algorithm, named `Two out of Three

models has remained largely unexplored. At the same time, large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable universal question-answering abilities, yet
they face challenges in specialized scenarios due to data scarcity, privacy
concerns, and high computational costs, thus more and more specialized small
language models (SLMs) are being trained for specific domains. To address these
limitations systematically, the learnware paradigm provides a promising
solution by enabling maximum utilization of specialized SLMs, and allowing
users to identify and reuse them in a collaborative and privacy-preserving
manner.
  This paper presents a preliminary attempt to apply the learnware paradigm to
language models. We simulated a learnware system comprising approximately 100
learnwares of specialized SLMs with 8B parameters, fine-tuned across finance,
healthcare, and mathematics domains. Each learnware contains an SLM and a
specification, which enables users to identify the most relevant models without
exposing their own data. Experimental results demonstrate promising
performance: by selecting one suitable learnware for each task-specific
inference, the system outperforms the base SLMs on all benchmarks. Compared to
LLMs, the system outperforms Qwen1.5-110B, Qwen2.5-72B, and
Llama3.1-70B-Instruct by at least 14% in finance domain tasks, and surpasses
Flan-PaLM-540B (ranked 7th on the Open Medical LLM Leaderboard) in medical
domain tasks.

Abstract: This research confronts the challenge of substantial physical equation
discrepancies encountered in the generation of spatiotemporal physical fields
through data-driven trained models. A spatiotemporal physical field generation
model, named HMT-PF, is developed based on the hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, incorporating unstructured grid information as input. A
fine-tuning block, enhanced with physical information, is introduced to
effectively reduce the physical equation discrepancies. The physical equation
residuals are computed through a point query mechanism for efficient gradient
evaluation, then encoded into latent space for refinement. The fine-tuning
process employs a self-supervised learning approach to achieve physical
consistency while maintaining essential field characteristics. Results show
that the hybrid Mamba-Transformer model achieves good performance in generating
spatiotemporal fields, while the physics-informed fine-tuning mechanism further
reduces significant physical errors effectively. A MSE-R evaluation method is
developed to assess the accuracy and realism of physical field generation.

Result: 理论证明REFINE可防止负迁移，实验表明其在多种数据模态上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: REFINE是一种轻量级、架构无关且稳健的迁移学习方法。

Abstract: Transfer learning typically leverages representations learned from a source
domain to improve performance on a target task. A common approach is to extract
features from a pre-trained model and directly apply them for target
prediction. However, this strategy is prone to negative transfer where the
source representation fails to align with the target distribution. In this
article, we propose Residual Feature Integration (REFINE), a simple yet
effective method designed to mitigate negative transfer. Our approach combines
a fixed source-side representation with a trainable target-side encoder and
fits a shallow neural network on the resulting joint representation, which
adapts to the target domain while preserving transferable knowledge from the
source domain. Theoretically, we prove that REFINE is sufficient to prevent
negative transfer under mild conditions, and derive the generalization bound
demonstrating its theoretical benefit. Empirically, we show that REFINE
consistently enhances performance across diverse application and data
modalities including vision, text, and tabular data, and outperforms numerous
alternative solutions. Our method is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and
robust, making it a valuable addition to the existing transfer learning
toolbox.

Conclusion: 多维奖励函数在特定条件下是必要的，且在MDP中具有实用性。

Abstract: Recent work has formalized the reward hypothesis through the lens of expected
utility theory, by interpreting reward as utility. Hausner's foundational work
showed that dropping the continuity axiom leads to a generalization of expected
utility theory where utilities are lexicographically ordered vectors of
arbitrary dimension. In this paper, we extend this result by identifying a
simple and practical condition under which preferences cannot be represented by
scalar rewards, necessitating a 2-dimensional reward function. We provide a
full characterization of such reward functions, as well as the general
d-dimensional case, in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) under a memorylessness
assumption on preferences. Furthermore, we show that optimal policies in this
setting retain many desirable properties of their scalar-reward counterparts,
while in the Constrained MDP (CMDP) setting -- another common multiobjective
setting -- they do not.

Result: 理论和实验验证了ACU在遗忘效果、模型保真度和系统效率上的优越性。

Conclusion: ACU为持续遗忘提供了一种高效且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence demands that models incrementally
update knowledge by Continual Learning (CL) to adapt to open-world
environments. To meet privacy and security requirements, Continual Unlearning
(CU) emerges as an important problem, aiming to sequentially forget particular
knowledge acquired during the CL phase. However, existing unlearning methods
primarily focus on single-shot joint forgetting and face significant
limitations when applied to CU. First, most existing methods require access to
the retained dataset for re-training or fine-tuning, violating the inherent
constraint in CL that historical data cannot be revisited. Second, these
methods often suffer from a poor trade-off between system efficiency and model
fidelity, making them vulnerable to being overwhelmed or degraded by
adversaries through deliberately frequent requests. In this paper, we identify
that the limitations of existing unlearning methods stem fundamentally from
their reliance on gradient-based updates. To bridge the research gap at its
root, we propose a novel gradient-free method for CU, named Analytic Continual
Unlearning (ACU), for efficient and exact forgetting with historical data
privacy preservation. In response to each unlearning request, our ACU
recursively derives an analytical (i.e., closed-form) solution in an
interpretable manner using the least squares method. Theoretical and
experimental evaluations validate the superiority of our ACU on unlearning
effectiveness, model fidelity, and system efficiency.

Result: 在七个真实数据集上的实验表明，仅通过添加CVPE模块，Time-LLM的性能显著提升。

Conclusion: CVPE模块有效提升了CI模型在时间序列预测中的性能，同时避免了过拟合问题。

Abstract: Transformers have recently gained popularity in time series forecasting due
to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. However, many existing
models focus only on capturing temporal dependencies while omitting intricate
relationships between variables. Recent models have tried tackling this by
explicitly modeling both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies through a
sequential or unified attention mechanism, but they are entirely channel
dependent (CD) across all layers, making them potentially susceptible to
overfitting. To address this, we propose Cross-Variate Patch Embeddings (CVPE),
a lightweight CD module that injects cross-variate context into
channel-independent (CI) models by simply modifying the patch embedding
process. We achieve this by adding a learnable positional encoding and a
lightweight router-attention block to the vanilla patch embedding layer. We
then integrate CVPE into Time-LLM, a multimodal CI forecasting model, to
demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing cross-variate dependencies and
enhance the CI model's performance. Extensive experimental results on seven
real-world datasets show that our enhanced Time-LLM outperforms the original
baseline model simply by incorporating the CVPE module, with no other changes.

Result: 实验显示CFSMOTE在多个公平性指标上显著优于传统C-SMOTE，同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: CFSMOTE是一种有效的预处理方法，能同时优化公平性和性能。

Abstract: As machine learning is increasingly applied in an online fashion to deal with
evolving data streams, the fairness of these algorithms is a matter of growing
ethical and legal concern. In many use cases, class imbalance in the data also
needs to be dealt with to ensure predictive performance. Current fairness-aware
stream learners typically attempt to solve these issues through in- or
post-processing by focusing on optimizing one specific discrimination metric,
addressing class imbalance in a separate processing step. While C-SMOTE is a
highly effective model-agnostic pre-processing approach to mitigate class
imbalance, as a side effect of this method, algorithmic bias is often
introduced.
  Therefore, we propose CFSMOTE - a fairness-aware, continuous SMOTE variant -
as a pre-processing approach to simultaneously address the class imbalance and
fairness concerns by employing situation testing and balancing
fairness-relevant groups during oversampling. Unlike other fairness-aware
stream learners, CFSMOTE is not optimizing for only one specific fairness
metric, therefore avoiding potentially problematic trade-offs. Our experiments
show significant improvement on several common group fairness metrics in
comparison to vanilla C-SMOTE while maintaining competitive performance, also
in comparison to other fairness-aware algorithms.

can favor majority groups and produce stereotypical predictors that neglect
minority-specific features. Assuming population and variance imbalance, our
analysis reveals three key findings: (i) the close proximity between
``full-data'' and stereotypical predictors, (ii) the dominance of a region
where training the entire model tends to merely learn the majority traits, and
(iii) a lower bound on the additional training required. Our results are
illustrated through experiments in deep learning for tabular and image

Abstract: Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are
governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer
generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their
long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any
new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference
capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate
ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR
model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided
context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the
long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation
models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters and
orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation
models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts,
even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used
for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training
corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems,
and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also
for advancing the TS prediction field.

Abstract: Transfer learning across domains with distribution shift remains a
fundamental challenge in building robust and adaptable machine learning
systems. While adversarial perturbations are traditionally viewed as threats
that expose model vulnerabilities, recent studies suggest that they can also
serve as constructive tools for data augmentation. In this work, we
systematically investigate the role of adversarial data augmentation (ADA) in
enhancing both robustness and adaptivity in transfer learning settings. We
analyze how adversarial examples, when used strategically during training,
improve domain generalization by enriching decision boundaries and reducing
overfitting to source-domain-specific features. We further propose a unified
framework that integrates ADA with consistency regularization and
domain-invariant representation learning. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets -- including VisDA, DomainNet, and Office-Home --
demonstrate that our method consistently improves target-domain performance
under both unsupervised and few-shot domain adaptation settings. Our results
highlight a constructive perspective of adversarial learning, transforming
perturbation from a destructive attack into a regularizing force for
cross-domain transferability.

Abstract: We introduce Qronos -- a new state-of-the-art post-training quantization

update rules. Importantly, we prove that Qronos admits an efficient
implementation that uses the Cholesky decomposition for solving least-squares
problems. We also demonstrate that Qronos is compatible with existing
transformation techniques such as Hadamard-based incoherence processing and
weight-activation scaling equalization, among others. We evaluate Qronos using

Abstract: Fair classification is a critical challenge that has gained increasing
importance due to international regulations and its growing use in high-stakes
decision-making settings. Existing methods often rely on adversarial learning
or distribution matching across sensitive groups; however, adversarial learning
can be unstable, and distribution matching can be computationally intensive. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel approach based on the
characteristic function distance. Our method ensures that the learned
representation contains minimal sensitive information while maintaining high
effectiveness for downstream tasks. By utilizing characteristic functions, we
achieve a more stable and efficient solution compared to traditional methods.
Additionally, we introduce a simple relaxation of the objective function that
guarantees fairness in common classification models with no performance
degradation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently matches or achieves better fairness and predictive
accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, our method maintains robustness and
computational efficiency, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Conformal prediction quantifies the uncertainty of machine learning models by
augmenting point predictions with valid prediction sets, assuming
exchangeability. For complex scenarios involving multiple trials, models, or
data sources, conformal prediction sets can be aggregated to create a
prediction set that captures the overall uncertainty, often improving
precision. However, aggregating multiple prediction sets with individual
$1-\alpha$ coverage inevitably weakens the overall guarantee, typically
resulting in $1-2\alpha$ worst-case coverage. In this work, we propose a
framework for the weighted aggregation of prediction sets, where weights are
assigned to each prediction set based on their contribution. Our framework
offers flexible control over how the sets are aggregated, achieving tighter
coverage bounds that interpolate between the $1-2\alpha$ guarantee of the
combined models and the $1-\alpha$ guarantee of an individual model depending
on the distribution of weights. We extend our framework to data-dependent
weights, and we derive a general procedure for data-dependent weight
aggregation that maintains finite-sample validity. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods through experiments on synthetic and real data in
the mixture-of-experts setting, and we show that aggregation with
data-dependent weights provides a form of adaptive coverage.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting has remained a critical challenge for deep neural
networks in Continual Learning (CL) as it undermines consolidated knowledge
when learning new tasks. Parameter efficient fine tuning CL techniques are
gaining traction for their effectiveness in addressing catastrophic forgetting
with a lightweight training schedule while avoiding degradation of consolidated
knowledge in pre-trained models. However, low rank adapters (LoRA) in these
approaches are highly sensitive to rank selection which can lead to sub-optimal
resource allocation and performance. To this end, we introduce PEARL, a
rehearsal-free CL framework that entails dynamic rank allocation for LoRA
components during CL training. Specifically, PEARL leverages reference task
weights and adaptively determines the rank of task-specific LoRA components
based on the current tasks' proximity to reference task weights in parameter
space. To demonstrate the versatility of PEARL, we evaluate it across three
vision architectures (ResNet, Separable Convolutional Network and Vision
Transformer) and a multitude of CL scenarios, and show that PEARL outperforms
all considered baselines by a large margin.

Abstract: Understanding the statistical properties of deep neural networks (DNNs) at
initialization is crucial for elucidating both their trainability and the
intrinsic architectural biases they encode prior to data exposure. Mean-field
(MF) analyses have demonstrated that the parameter distribution in randomly
initialized networks dictates whether gradients vanish or explode.
Concurrently, untrained DNNs were found to exhibit an initial-guessing bias
(IGB), in which large regions of the input space are assigned to a single
class. In this work, we derive a theoretical proof establishing the
correspondence between IGB and previous MF theories, thereby connecting a
network prejudice toward specific classes with the conditions for fast and
accurate learning. This connection yields the counter-intuitive conclusion: the
initialization that optimizes trainability is necessarily biased, rather than
neutral. Furthermore, we extend the MF/IGB framework to multi-node activation
functions, offering practical guidelines for designing initialization schemes
that ensure stable optimization in architectures employing max- and
average-pooling layers.

Abstract: Invariant representations are core to representation learning, yet a central
challenge remains: uncovering invariants that are stable and transferable
without suppressing task-relevant signals. This raises fundamental questions,
requiring further inquiry, about the appropriate level of abstraction at which
such invariants should be defined, and which aspects of a system they should
characterize. Interpretation of the environment relies on abstract knowledge
structures to make sense of the current state, which leads to interactions,
essential drivers of learning and knowledge acquisition. We posit that
interpretation operates at the level of higher-order relational knowledge;
hence, invariant structures must be where knowledge resides, specifically, as
partitions defined by the closure of relational paths within an abstract
knowledge space. These partitions serve as the core invariant representations,
forming the structural substrate where knowledge is stored and learning occurs.
On the other hand, inter-partition connectors enable the deployment of these
knowledge partitions encoding task-relevant transitions. Thus, invariant
partitions provide the foundational primitives of structured representation. We
formalize the computational foundations for structured representation of the
invariant partitions based on closed semiring, a relational algebraic
structure.

Motivation: 现有正则化方法（如L1、L2）在训练形式语言时无法收敛到完美解，甚至可能偏离完美初始化。研究旨在寻找更优的正则化方法。

Method: 提出使用最小描述长度（MDL）作为正则化方法，平衡模型复杂度和数据拟合。

Result: 实验表明，MDL能独立于优化算法选择完美解，避免过拟合并提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: MDL提供了理论支持的正则化方法，优于传统方法，适用于需要精确解的模型训练。

Abstract: State-of-the-art neural networks can be trained to become remarkable
solutions to many problems. But while these architectures can express symbolic,
perfect solutions, trained models often arrive at approximations instead. We
show that the choice of regularization method plays a crucial role: when
trained on formal languages with standard regularization ($L_1$, $L_2$, or
none), expressive architectures not only fail to converge to correct solutions
but are actively pushed away from perfect initializations. In contrast,
applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to balance model
complexity with data fit provides a theoretically grounded regularization
method. Using MDL, perfect solutions are selected over approximations,
independently of the optimization algorithm. We propose that unlike existing
regularization techniques, MDL introduces the appropriate inductive bias to
effectively counteract overfitting and promote generalization.

Motivation: 轻量级VLM在资源受限应用中至关重要，但现有方法依赖冻结视觉和语言模型，导致对齐质量受限。

Method: 提出TinyAlign框架，利用检索增强生成技术从记忆库中检索相关上下文，增强多模态输入的对齐。

Result: 实验表明TinyAlign显著降低训练损失、加速收敛，并仅需40%微调数据即可达到基线性能。

Conclusion: TinyAlign为轻量级VLM开发提供了实用方法，并为理解多模态系统对齐瓶颈提供了新视角。

Abstract: Lightweight Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are indispensable for
resource-constrained applications. The prevailing approach to aligning vision
and language models involves freezing both the vision encoder and the language
model while training small connector modules. However, this strategy heavily
depends on the intrinsic capabilities of the language model, which can be
suboptimal for lightweight models with limited representational capacity. In
this work, we investigate this alignment bottleneck through the lens of mutual
information, demonstrating that the constrained capacity of the language model
inherently limits the Effective Mutual Information (EMI) between multimodal
inputs and outputs, thereby compromising alignment quality. To address this
challenge, we propose TinyAlign, a novel framework inspired by
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which strategically retrieves relevant context
from a memory bank to enrich multimodal inputs and enhance their alignment.
Extensive empirical evaluations reveal that TinyAlign significantly reduces
training loss, accelerates convergence, and enhances task performance.
Remarkably, it allows models to achieve baseline-level performance with only
40\% of the fine-tuning data, highlighting exceptional data efficiency. Our
work thus offers a practical pathway for developing more capable lightweight
VLMs while introducing a fresh theoretical lens to better understand and
address alignment bottlenecks in constrained multimodal systems.

Abstract: While norm-based and leverage-score-based methods have been extensively
studied for identifying "important" data points in linear models, analogous
tools for nonlinear models remain significantly underdeveloped. By introducing
the concept of the adjoint operator of a nonlinear map, we address this gap and
generalize norm-based and leverage-score-based importance sampling to nonlinear
settings. We demonstrate that sampling based on these generalized notions of
norm and leverage scores provides approximation guarantees for the underlying
nonlinear mapping, similar to linear subspace embeddings. As direct
applications, these nonlinear scores not only reduce the computational
complexity of training nonlinear models by enabling efficient sampling over
large datasets but also offer a novel mechanism for model explainability and
outlier detection. Our contributions are supported by both theoretical analyses
and experimental results across a variety of supervised learning scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised framework for \emph{Invariant Risk

labels are unavailable. Traditional IRM methods rely on labeled data to learn
representations that are robust to distributional shifts across environments.
In contrast, our approach redefines invariance through feature distribution
alignment, enabling robust representation learning from unlabeled data. We
introduce two methods within this framework: Principal Invariant Component
Analysis (PICA), a linear method that extracts invariant directions under
Gaussian assumptions, and Variational Invariant Autoencoder (VIAE), a deep
generative model that disentangles environment-invariant and
environment-dependent latent factors. Our approach is based on a novel
``unsupervised'' structural causal model and supports environment-conditioned
sample-generation and intervention. Empirical evaluations on synthetic dataset
and modified versions of MNIST demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in
capturing invariant structure, preserving relevant information, and
generalizing across environments without access to labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SSL方法对表示空间维度（H(R)）和互信息（I(R;Z)）的理解不足，缺乏对训练动态和下游性能关系的深入分析。

Method: 通过分析训练动态，提出AdaDim方法，自适应加权特征解相关和样本均匀分布的损失。

Result: 发现最佳SSL模型并非H(R)最高或I(R;Z)最低，而是达到两者的中间平衡点。

Conclusion: AdaDim通过动态调整损失权重，优化了SSL模型的训练和性能。

Abstract: A key factor in effective Self-Supervised learning (SSL) is preventing
dimensional collapse, which is where higher-dimensional representation spaces
span a lower-dimensional subspace. Therefore, SSL optimization strategies
involve guiding a model to produce representations ($R$) with a higher
dimensionality. Dimensionality is either optimized through a
dimension-contrastive approach that encourages feature decorrelation or through
a sample-contrastive method that promotes a uniform spread of sample
representations. Both families of SSL algorithms also utilize a projection head
that maps $R$ into a lower-dimensional embedding space $Z$. Recent work has
characterized the projection head as a filter of irrelevant features from the
SSL objective by reducing mutual information, $I(R;Z)$. Therefore, the current
literature's view is that a good SSL representation space should have a high
$H(R)$ and a low $I(R;Z)$. However, this view of the problem is lacking in
terms of an understanding of the underlying training dynamics that influences
both terms, as well as how the values of $H(R)$ and $I(R;Z)$ arrived at the end
of training reflect the downstream performance of an SSL model. We address both
gaps in the literature by demonstrating that increases in $H(R)$ due to feature
decorrelation at the start of training lead to a higher $I(R;Z)$, while
increases in $H(R)$ due to samples distributing uniformly in a high-dimensional
space at the end of training cause $I(R;Z)$ to plateau or decrease.
Furthermore, our analysis shows that the best performing SSL models do not have
the highest $H(R)$ nor the lowest $I(R;Z)$, but arrive at an optimal
intermediate point for both. We develop a method called AdaDim to exploit these
observed training dynamics by adaptively weighting between losses based on
feature decorrelation and uniform sample spread.

Conclusion: FreKoo通过频域分析和理论保证，有效提升了模型在动态环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models struggle to maintain performance in dynamic
environments where temporal distribution shifts, \emph{i.e., concept drift},
are prevalent. Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) seeks to enable model
generalization across evolving domains, yet existing approaches typically
assume smooth incremental changes, struggling with complex real-world drifts
involving long-term structure (incremental evolution/periodicity) and local
uncertainties. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FreKoo, which
tackles these challenges via a novel frequency-domain analysis of parameter
trajectories. It leverages the Fourier transform to disentangle parameter
evolution into distinct spectral bands. Specifically, low-frequency component
with dominant dynamics are learned and extrapolated using the Koopman operator,
robustly capturing diverse drift patterns including both incremental and
periodicity. Simultaneously, potentially disruptive high-frequency variations
are smoothed via targeted temporal regularization, preventing overfitting to
transient noise and domain uncertainties. In addition, this dual spectral
strategy is rigorously grounded through theoretical analysis, providing
stability guarantees for the Koopman prediction, a principled Bayesian
justification for the high-frequency regularization, and culminating in a
multiscale generalization bound connecting spectral dynamics to improved
generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate FreKoo's significant
superiority over SOTA TDG approaches, particularly excelling in real-world
streaming scenarios with complex drifts and uncertainties.

Result: 在 8 个多样化基准测试中优于 20 个基线方法。

Conclusion: FedGFM+ 有效解决了知识纠缠问题，提升了跨领域适应性。

Abstract: Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric
paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL)
enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task
heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM)
offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines,
missing out on cross-silo data and resources.
  These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable
benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM
training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where
multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering
downstream adaptation.
  To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core
modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based
domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes
its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors.
Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We
theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains,
providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2)
AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a
lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During
fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects
relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream
adaptation.
  FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated
GFM variants.

Result: 在OGBench基准测试中，OTA方法在迷宫导航和视觉机器人操作等复杂任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: OTA通过改进价值函数，显著提升了离线GCRL在长时任务中的性能。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) offers a practical
learning paradigm where goal-reaching policies are trained from abundant
unlabeled (reward-free) datasets without additional environment interaction.
However, offline GCRL still struggles with long-horizon tasks, even with recent
advances that employ hierarchical policy structures, such as HIQL. By
identifying the root cause of this challenge, we observe the following
insights: First, performance bottlenecks mainly stem from the high-level
policy's inability to generate appropriate subgoals. Second, when learning the
high-level policy in the long-horizon regime, the sign of the advantage signal
frequently becomes incorrect. Thus, we argue that improving the value function
to produce a clear advantage signal for learning the high-level policy is
essential. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution:
Option-aware Temporally Abstracted value learning, dubbed OTA, which
incorporates temporal abstraction into the temporal-difference learning
process. By modifying the value update to be option-aware, the proposed
learning scheme contracts the effective horizon length, enabling better
advantage estimates even in long-horizon regimes. We experimentally show that
the high-level policy extracted using the OTA value function achieves strong
performance on complex tasks from OGBench, a recently proposed offline GCRL
benchmark, including maze navigation and visual robotic manipulation
environments.

Abstract: Advanced epidemic forecasting is critical for enabling precision containment
strategies, highlighting its strategic importance for public health security.
While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
effectiveness as foundation models for domain-specific tasks, their potential
for epidemic forecasting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we
introduce EpiLLM, a novel LLM-based framework tailored for spatio-temporal
epidemic forecasting. Considering the key factors in real-world epidemic
transmission: infection cases and human mobility, we introduce a dual-branch
architecture to achieve fine-grained token-level alignment between such complex
epidemic patterns and language tokens for LLM adaptation. To unleash the
multi-step forecasting and generalization potential of LLM architectures, we
propose an autoregressive modeling paradigm that reformulates the epidemic
forecasting task into next-token prediction. To further enhance LLM perception
of epidemics, we introduce spatio-temporal prompt learning techniques, which
strengthen forecasting capabilities from a data-driven perspective. Extensive
experiments show that EpiLLM significantly outperforms existing baselines on
real-world COVID-19 datasets and exhibits scaling behavior characteristic of
LLMs.

Result: μPC成功训练了128层残差网络，性能与现有基准相当，且支持权重和活动学习率的零样本迁移。

Conclusion: μPC为局部算法提供了新思路，并可扩展至卷积和Transformer架构。

Abstract: The biological implausibility of backpropagation (BP) has motivated many
alternative, brain-inspired algorithms that attempt to rely only on local
information, such as predictive coding (PC) and equilibrium propagation.
However, these algorithms have notoriously struggled to train very deep
networks, preventing them from competing with BP in large-scale settings.
Indeed, scaling PC networks (PCNs) has recently been posed as a challenge for
the community (Pinchetti et al., 2024). Here, we show that 100+ layer PCNs can
be trained reliably using a Depth-$\mu$P parameterisation (Yang et al., 2023;
Bordelon et al., 2023) which we call "$\mu$PC". Through an extensive analysis
of the scaling behaviour of PCNs, we reveal several pathologies that make
standard PCNs difficult to train at large depths. We then show that, despite
addressing only some of these instabilities, $\mu$PC allows stable training of
very deep (up to 128-layer) residual networks on simple classification tasks
with competitive performance and little tuning compared to current benchmarks.
Moreover, $\mu$PC enables zero-shot transfer of both weight and activity
learning rates across widths and depths. Our results have implications for
other local algorithms and could be extended to convolutional and transformer
architectures. Code for $\mu$PC is made available as part of a JAX library for
PCNs at https://github.com/thebuckleylab/jpc (Innocenti et al., 2024).

Conclusion: TempDATA通过潜在空间的时间结构化增强转换，显著提升了离线模型强化学习在稀疏奖励和长时程任务中的性能。

Abstract: The goal of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to extract a
high-performance policy from the fixed datasets, minimizing performance
degradation due to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Offline model-based RL
(MBRL) is a promising approach that ameliorates OOD issues by enriching
state-action transitions with augmentations synthesized via a learned dynamics
model. Unfortunately, seminal offline MBRL methods often struggle in
sparse-reward, long-horizon tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel MBRL
framework, dubbed Temporal Distance-Aware Transition Augmentation (TempDATA),
that generates augmented transitions in a temporally structured latent space
rather than in raw state space. To model long-horizon behavior, TempDATA learns
a latent abstraction that captures a temporal distance from both trajectory and
transition levels of state space. Our experiments confirm that TempDATA
outperforms previous offline MBRL methods and achieves matching or surpassing
the performance of diffusion-based trajectory augmentation and goal-conditioned
RL on the D4RL AntMaze, FrankaKitchen, CALVIN, and pixel-based FrankaKitchen.

Abstract: We introduce Velocity-Regularized Adam (VRAdam), a physics-inspired optimizer
for training deep neural networks that draws on ideas from quartic terms for
kinetic energy with its stabilizing effects on various system dynamics.
Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so called
adaptive edge of stability regime during training leading to rapid oscillations
and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on
the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically
slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that
the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, damping
oscillations and allowing for a more aggressive base step size when necessary
without divergence. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global
damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam to create a hybrid optimizer, we
demonstrate that VRAdam consistently exceeds the performance against standard
optimizers including AdamW. We benchmark various tasks such as image
classification, language modeling, image generation and generative modeling
using diverse architectures and training methodologies including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and GFlowNets.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in the area, adversarial robustness remains
a critical challenge in systems employing machine learning models. The removal
of adversarial perturbations at inference time, known as adversarial
purification, has emerged as a promising defense strategy. To achieve this,
state-of-the-art methods leverage diffusion models that inject Gaussian noise
during a forward process to dilute adversarial perturbations, followed by a
denoising step to restore clean samples before classification. In this work, we
propose FlowPure, a novel purification method based on Continuous Normalizing
Flows (CNFs) trained with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to learn mappings
from adversarial examples to their clean counterparts. Unlike prior
diffusion-based approaches that rely on fixed noise processes, FlowPure can
leverage specific attack knowledge to improve robustness under known threats,
while also supporting a more general stochastic variant trained on Gaussian
perturbations for settings where such knowledge is unavailable. Experiments on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
purification-based defenses in preprocessor-blind and white-box scenarios, and
can do so while fully preserving benign accuracy in the former. Moreover, our
results show that not only is FlowPure a highly effective purifier but it also
holds a strong potential for adversarial detection, identifying
preprocessor-blind PGD samples with near-perfect accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional performance,
yet their iterative sampling procedures remain computationally expensive. A
prominent strategy to mitigate this cost is distillation, with offline
distillation offering particular advantages in terms of efficiency, modularity,
and flexibility. In this work, we identify two key observations that motivate a
principled distillation framework: (1) while diffusion models have been viewed
through the lens of dynamical systems theory, powerful and underexplored tools
can be further leveraged; and (2) diffusion models inherently impose
structured, semantically coherent trajectories in latent space. Building on
these observations, we introduce the Koopman Distillation Model KDM, a novel
offline distillation approach grounded in Koopman theory-a classical framework
for representing nonlinear dynamics linearly in a transformed space. KDM
encodes noisy inputs into an embedded space where a learned linear operator
propagates them forward, followed by a decoder that reconstructs clean samples.
This enables single-step generation while preserving semantic fidelity. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach: (1) under mild assumptions,
the learned diffusion dynamics admit a finite-dimensional Koopman
representation; and (2) proximity in the Koopman latent space correlates with
semantic similarity in the generated outputs, allowing for effective trajectory
alignment. Empirically, KDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across
standard offline distillation benchmarks, improving FID scores by up to 40% in
a single generation step. All implementation details and code for the

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为X-Freq的纯频域监督方法，通过频域损失提升时间序列预测性能，无需修改模型架构或超参数。

Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法多基于时域监督，且假设数据独立同分布，忽略了时间标签的强相关性。X-Freq通过频域监督解决这些问题。

Conclusion: X-Freq是一种高效、通用的频域监督方法，显著提升了时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields, and the
methods based on frequency domain analysis have become an important branch.
However, most existing studies focus on the design of elaborate model
architectures and are often tailored for limited datasets, still lacking
universality. Besides, the assumption of independent and identically
distributed (IID) data also contradicts the strong correlation of the time
domain labels. To address these issues, abandoning time domain supervision, we
propose a purely frequency domain supervision approach named cross-dimensional
frequency (X-Freq) loss. Specifically, based on a statistical phenomenon, we
first prove that the information entropy of the time series is higher than its
spectral entropy, which implies higher certainty in frequency domain and thus
can provide better supervision. Secondly, the Fourier Transform and the Wavelet
Transform are applied to the time dimension and the channel dimension of the
time series respectively, to capture the long-term and short-term frequency
variations as well as the spatial configuration features. Thirdly, the loss
between predictions and targets is uniformly computed in the frequency domain.
Moreover, we plug-and-play incorporate X-Freq into multiple advanced
forecasting models and compare on 14 real-world datasets. The experimental
results demonstrate that, without making any modification to the original
architectures or hyperparameters, X-Freq can improve the forecasting
performance by an average of 3.3% on long-term forecasting datasets and 27.7%
on short-term ones, showcasing superior generality and practicality. The code
will be released publicly.

Abstract: Deploying deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained
devices presents significant challenges due to their high computational demands
and rigid, static architectures. To overcome these limitations, this thesis
explores methods for enabling CNNs to dynamically adjust their computational
complexity based on available hardware resources. We introduce adaptive CNN
architectures capable of scaling their capacity at runtime, thus efficiently
balancing performance and resource utilization. To achieve this adaptability,
we propose a structured pruning and dynamic re-construction approach that
creates nested subnetworks within a single CNN model. This approach allows the
network to dynamically switch between compact and full-sized configurations
without retraining, making it suitable for deployment across varying hardware
platforms. Experiments conducted across multiple CNN architectures including
VGG-16, AlexNet, ResNet-20, and ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10 and Imagenette datasets
demonstrate that adaptive models effectively maintain or even enhance
performance under varying computational constraints. Our results highlight that
embedding adaptability directly into CNN architectures significantly improves
their robustness and flexibility, paving the way for efficient real-world
deployment in diverse computational environments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training across edge
devices in a privacy-friendly manner. However, its efficiency heavily depends
on effective device selection and high-dimensional resource allocation in
dynamic and heterogeneous wireless environments. Conventional methods demand a
confluence of domain-specific expertise, extensive hyperparameter tuning,
and/or heavy interaction cost. This paper proposes a Tool-aided Evolutionary
Large Language Model (T-ELLM) framework to generate a qualified policy for
device selection in a wireless FL environment. Unlike conventional optimization
methods, T-ELLM leverages natural language-based scenario prompts to enhance
generalization across varying network conditions. The framework decouples the
joint optimization problem mathematically, enabling tractable learning of
device selection policies while delegating resource allocation to convex
optimization tools. To improve adaptability, T-ELLM integrates a
sample-efficient, model-based virtual learning environment that captures the
relationship between device selection and learning performance, facilitating
subsequent group relative policy optimization. This concerted approach reduces
reliance on real-world interactions, minimizing communication overhead while
maintaining high-fidelity decision-making. Theoretical analysis proves that the
discrepancy between virtual and real environments is bounded, ensuring the
advantage function learned in the virtual environment maintains a provably
small deviation from real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate
that T-ELLM outperforms benchmark methods in energy efficiency and exhibits
robust adaptability to environmental changes.

Abstract: Feature selection removes redundant features to enhanc performance and
computational efficiency in downstream tasks. Existing works often struggle to
capture complex feature interactions and adapt to diverse scenarios. Recent
advances in this domain have incorporated generative intelligence to address
these drawbacks by uncovering intricate relationships between features.
However, two key limitations remain: 1) embedding feature subsets in a
continuous space is challenging due to permutation sensitivity, as changes in
feature order can introduce biases and weaken the embedding learning process;
2) gradient-based search in the embedding space assumes convexity, which is
rarely guaranteed, leading to reduced search effectiveness and suboptimal
subsets. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework that can: 1)
preserve feature subset knowledge in a continuous embedding space while
ensuring permutation invariance; 2) effectively explore the embedding space
without relying on strong convex assumptions. For the first objective, we
develop an encoder-decoder paradigm to preserve feature selection knowledge
into a continuous embedding space. This paradigm captures feature interactions
through pairwise relationships within the subset, removing the influence of
feature order on the embedding. Moreover, an inducing point mechanism is
introduced to accelerate pairwise relationship computations. For the second
objective, we employ a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach to
guide the exploration of the embedding space. The RL agent effectively
navigates the space by balancing multiple objectives. By prioritizing
high-potential regions adaptively and eliminating the reliance on convexity
assumptions, the RL agent effectively reduces the risk of converging to local
optima. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency,
robustness and explicitness of our model.

Abstract: Benign overfitting is a phenomenon in machine learning where a model
perfectly fits (interpolates) the training data, including noisy examples, yet
still generalizes well to unseen data. Understanding this phenomenon has
attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this work, we introduce a
conceptual shift, by focusing on almost benign overfitting, where models
simultaneously achieve both arbitrarily small training and test errors. This
behavior is characteristic of neural networks, which often achieve low (but
non-zero) training error while still generalizing well. We hypothesize that
this almost benign overfitting can emerge even in classical regimes, by
analyzing how the interaction between sample size and model complexity enables
larger models to achieve both good training fit but still approach
Bayes-optimal generalization. We substantiate this hypothesis with theoretical
evidence from two case studies: (i) kernel ridge regression, and (ii)
least-squares regression using a two-layer fully connected ReLU neural network
trained via gradient flow. In both cases, we overcome the strong assumptions
often required in prior work on benign overfitting.
  Our results on neural networks also provide the first generalization result
in this setting that does not rely on any assumptions about the underlying
regression function or noise, beyond boundedness. Our analysis introduces a
novel proof technique based on decomposing the excess risk into estimation and
approximation errors, interpreting gradient flow as an implicit regularizer,
that helps avoid uniform convergence traps. This analysis idea could be of
independent interest.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting has a wide range of applications
in both industry and academia. Recently, spatial-temporal graph neural networks
(STGNNs) have gained popularity as MTS forecasting methods. However, current
STGNNs can only use the finite length of MTS input data due to the
computational complexity. Moreover, they lack the ability to identify similar
patterns throughout the entire dataset and struggle with data that exhibit
sparsely and discontinuously distributed correlations among variables over an
extensive historical period, resulting in only marginal improvements. In this
article, we introduce a simple yet effective k-nearest neighbor MTS forecasting
( kNN-MTS) framework, which forecasts with a nearest neighbor retrieval
mechanism over a large datastore of cached series, using representations from
the MTS model for similarity search. This approach requires no additional
training and scales to give the MTS model direct access to the whole dataset at
test time, resulting in a highly expressive model that consistently improves
performance, and has the ability to extract sparse distributed but similar
patterns spanning over multivariables from the entire dataset. Furthermore, a
hybrid spatial-temporal encoder (HSTEncoder) is designed for kNN-MTS which can
capture both long-term temporal and short-term spatial-temporal dependencies
and is shown to provide accurate representation for kNN-MTSfor better
forecasting. Experimental results on several real-world datasets show a
significant improvement in the forecasting performance of kNN-MTS. The
quantitative analysis also illustrates the interpretability and efficiency of
kNN-MTS, showing better application prospects and opening up a new path for
efficiently using the large dataset in MTS models.

Abstract: We address the computational and theoretical limitations of existing
distributional alignment methods for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA),
particularly regarding the estimation of classification performance and
confidence without target labels. Current theoretical frameworks for these
methods often yield computationally intractable quantities and fail to
adequately reflect the properties of the alignment algorithms employed. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Optimal Transport (OT) score, a
confidence metric derived from a novel theoretical analysis that exploits the
flexibility of decision boundaries induced by Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport
alignment. The proposed OT score is intuitively interpretable, theoretically
rigorous, and computationally efficient. It provides principled uncertainty
estimates for any given set of target pseudo-labels without requiring model
retraining, and can flexibly adapt to varying degrees of available source
information. Experimental results on standard UDA benchmarks demonstrate that
classification accuracy consistently improves by identifying and removing
low-confidence predictions, and that OT score significantly outperforms
existing confidence metrics across diverse adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: We develop a novel theoretical framework for analyzing ReLU neural networks
through the lens of a combinatorial object we term the ReLU Transition Graph
(RTG). In this graph, each node corresponds to a linear region induced by the
network's activation patterns, and edges connect regions that differ by a
single neuron flip. Building on this structure, we derive a suite of new
theoretical results connecting RTG geometry to expressivity, generalization,
and robustness. Our contributions include tight combinatorial bounds on RTG
size and diameter, a proof of RTG connectivity, and graph-theoretic
interpretations of VC-dimension. We also relate entropy and average degree of
the RTG to generalization error. Each theoretical result is rigorously
validated via carefully controlled experiments across varied network depths,
widths, and data regimes. This work provides the first unified treatment of
ReLU network structure via graph theory and opens new avenues for compression,
regularization, and complexity control rooted in RTG analysis.

separable, binary threshold activations allow exponential compression, and
Myhill-Nerode equivalence classes can be embedded into continuous latent spaces
while preserving separability. We also formalize the expressivity boundary:
fixed-depth feedforward networks cannot recognize non-regular languages
requiring unbounded memory. Unlike prior heuristic or probing-based studies, we
provide constructive proofs and design explicit DFA-unrolled neural
architectures that empirically validate every claim. Our results bridge deep

Abstract: In this paper we propose for the first time the hyperparameter optimization
(HPO) algorithm POCAII. POCAII differs from the Hyperband and Successive
Halving literature by explicitly separating the search and evaluation phases
and utilizing principled approaches to exploration and exploitation principles
during both phases. Such distinction results in a highly flexible scheme for
managing a hyperparameter optimization budget by focusing on search (i.e.,
generating competing configurations) towards the start of the HPO process while
increasing the evaluation effort as the HPO comes to an end.
  POCAII was compared to state of the art approaches SMAC, BOHB and DEHB. Our
algorithm shows superior performance in low-budget hyperparameter optimization
regimes. Since many practitioners do not have exhaustive resources to assign to
HPO, it has wide applications to real-world problems. Moreover, the empirical
evidence showed how POCAII demonstrates higher robustness and lower variance in
the results. This is again very important when considering realistic scenarios
with extremely expensive models to train.

Conclusion: 拓扑感知的聚合策略能有效加速OOD知识的传播，提升去中心化学习的性能。

Abstract: Decentralized learning enables collaborative training of models across
naturally distributed data without centralized coordination or maintenance of a
global model. Instead, devices are organized in arbitrary communication
topologies, in which they can only communicate with neighboring devices. Each
device maintains its own local model by training on its local data and
integrating new knowledge via model aggregation with neighbors. Therefore,
knowledge is propagated across the topology via successive aggregation rounds.
We study, in particular, the propagation of out-of-distribution (OOD)
knowledge. We find that popular decentralized learning algorithms struggle to
propagate OOD knowledge effectively to all devices. Further, we find that both
the location of OOD data within a topology, and the topology itself,
significantly impact OOD knowledge propagation. We then propose topology-aware
aggregation strategies to accelerate (OOD) knowledge propagation across
devices. These strategies improve OOD data accuracy, compared to
topology-unaware baselines, by 123% on average across models in a topology.

Abstract: Neural Operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between
function spaces. Among them, the kernel integral operator has been widely
validated on universally approximating various operators. Although recent
advancements following this definition have developed effective modules to
better approximate the kernel function defined on the original domain (with $d$
dimensions, $d=1, 2, 3...$), the unclarified evolving mechanism in the
embedding spaces blocks our view to design neural operators that can fully
capture the target system evolution.
  Drawing on recent breakthroughs in quantum simulation of partial differential
equations (PDEs), we elucidate the linear evolution process in neural
operators. Based on that, we redefine neural operators on a new $d+1$
dimensional domain. Within this framework, we implement our proposed
Schr\"odingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO) aligning better with the $d+1$

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs generates node and graph
representations (i.e., embeddings) that can be used for downstream tasks such
as node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. Graph SSL is
particularly useful in scenarios with limited or no labeled data. Existing SSL
methods predominantly follow contrastive or generative paradigms, each
excelling in different tasks: contrastive methods typically perform well on
classification tasks, while generative methods often excel in link prediction.
In this paper, we present a novel architecture for graph SSL that integrates
the strengths of both approaches. Our framework introduces community-aware
node-level contrastive learning, providing more robust and effective positive
and negative node pairs generation, alongside graph-level contrastive learning
to capture global semantic information. Additionally, we employ a comprehensive
augmentation strategy that combines feature masking, node perturbation, and
edge perturbation, enabling robust and diverse representation learning. By
incorporating these enhancements, our model achieves superior performance
across multiple tasks, including node classification, clustering, and link
prediction. Evaluations on open benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model

state-action pairs via amplitude encoding and quantum parallelism. We introduce
a quantum-enhanced policy iteration algorithm with provable polynomial
reductions in sample complexity for the evaluation step, under standard
assumptions. To demonstrate the technical feasibility and theoretical soundness
of our approach, we validate Q-Policy on classical emulations of small discrete
control tasks. Due to current hardware and simulation limitations, our
experiments focus on showcasing proof-of-concept behavior rather than
large-scale empirical evaluation. Our results support the potential of Q-Policy
as a theoretical foundation for scalable RL on future quantum devices,
addressing RL scalability challenges beyond classical approaches.

Abstract: Multi-agent simulations enables the modeling and analyses of the dynamic
behaviors and interactions of autonomous entities evolving in complex
environments. Agent-based models (ABM) are widely used to study emergent
phenomena arising from local interactions. However, their high computational
cost poses a significant challenge, particularly for large-scale simulations
requiring extensive parameter exploration, optimization, or uncertainty
quantification. The increasing complexity of ABM limits their feasibility for
real-time decision-making and large-scale scenario analysis. To address these
limitations, surrogate models offer an efficient alternative by learning
approximations from sparse simulation data. These models provide
cheap-to-evaluate predictions, significantly reducing computational costs while
maintaining accuracy. Various machine learning techniques, including regression
models, neural networks, random forests and Gaussian processes, have been
applied to construct robust surrogates. Moreover, uncertainty quantification
and sensitivity analysis play a crucial role in enhancing model reliability and
interpretability.
  This article explores the motivations, methods, and applications of surrogate
modeling for ABM, emphasizing the trade-offs between accuracy, computational
efficiency, and interpretability. Through a case study on a segregation model,
we highlight the challenges associated with building and validating surrogate
models, comparing different approaches and evaluating their performance.
Finally, we discuss future perspectives on integrating surrogate models within
ABM to improve scalability, explainability, and real-time decision support
across various fields such as ecology, urban planning and economics.

Method: 通过将时间GNNs与二维乘积逻辑（PTL和模态逻辑K的乘积）连接，分析其表达能力。

Conclusion: 首次为时间GNNs提供了逻辑表征，并确立了其相对表达能力。

Abstract: In recent years, the expressive power of various neural architectures --
including graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and recurrent neural
networks -- has been characterised using tools from logic and formal language
theory. As the capabilities of basic architectures are becoming well
understood, increasing attention is turning to models that combine multiple
architectural paradigms. Among them particularly important, and challenging to
analyse, are temporal extensions of GNNs, which integrate both spatial
(graph-structure) and temporal (evolution over time) dimensions. In this paper,
we initiate the study of logical characterisation of temporal GNNs by
connecting them to two-dimensional product logics. We show that the expressive
power of temporal GNNs depends on how graph and temporal components are
combined. In particular, temporal GNNs that apply static GNNs recursively over
time can capture all properties definable in the product logic of (past)
propositional temporal logic PTL and the modal logic K. In contrast,
architectures such as graph-and-time TGNNs and global TGNNs can only express
restricted fragments of this logic, where the interaction between temporal and
spatial operators is syntactically constrained. These results yield the first
logical characterisations of temporal GNNs and establish new relative
expressiveness results for temporal GNNs.

Method: 通过分析扩散模型中的跨任务动态，提出了三个一致性准则（IKC、UKC、LKC），并基于此设计了CCD框架，通过分层损失函数实现知识保留与新能力学习。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，CCD在持续学习设置下取得了最先进的性能，显著提升了平均保真度（MF）和增量平均保真度（IMF）。

Conclusion: CCD框架通过一致性准则有效解决了扩散模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，为生成模型的持续学习提供了理论和方法支持。

Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in static data
generation, their deployment in streaming or continual learning (CL) scenarios
faces a major challenge: catastrophic forgetting (CF), where newly acquired
generative capabilities overwrite previously learned ones. To systematically
address this, we introduce a formal Continual Diffusion Generation (CDG)
paradigm that characterizes and redefines CL in the context of generative
diffusion models. Prior efforts often adapt heuristic strategies from continual
classification tasks but lack alignment with the underlying diffusion process.
In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for CDG by analyzing
cross-task dynamics in diffusion-based generative modeling. Our analysis
reveals that the retention and stability of generative knowledge across tasks
are governed by three key consistency criteria: inter-task knowledge
consistency (IKC), unconditional knowledge consistency (UKC), and label
knowledge consistency (LKC). Building on these insights, we propose Continual
Consistency Diffusion (CCD), a principled framework that integrates these
consistency objectives into training via hierarchical loss terms
$\mathcal{L}_{IKC}$, $\mathcal{L}_{UKC}$, and $\mathcal{L}_{LKC}$. This
promotes effective knowledge retention while enabling the assimilation of new
generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CCD achieves state-of-the-art performance under continual
settings, with substantial gains in Mean Fidelity (MF) and Incremental Mean
Fidelity (IMF), particularly in tasks with rich cross-task knowledge overlap.

Abstract: This paper introduces Attribution Projection Calculus (AP-Calculus), a novel
mathematical framework for determining causal relationships in structured
Bayesian networks. We investigate a specific network architecture with source
nodes connected to destination nodes through intermediate nodes, where each
input maps to a single label with maximum marginal probability. We prove that
for each label, exactly one intermediate node acts as a deconfounder while
others serve as confounders, enabling optimal attribution of features to their
corresponding labels. The framework formalizes the dual nature of intermediate
nodes as both confounders and deconfounders depending on the context, and
establishes separation functions that maximize distinctions between
intermediate representations. We demonstrate that the proposed network
architecture is optimal for causal inference compared to alternative
structures, including those based on Pearl's causal framework. AP-Calculus
provides a comprehensive mathematical foundation for analyzing feature-label
attributions, managing spurious correlations, quantifying information gain,
ensuring fairness, and evaluating uncertainty in prediction models, including
large language models. Theoretical verification shows that AP-Calculus not only
extends but can also subsume traditional do-calculus for many practical
applications, offering a more direct approach to causal inference in supervised
learning contexts.

Result: 在8个数据集上平均准确率提升23.70%，并在9种不同骨干网络上验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: GEM方法有效解决了GUI代理中的OOD检测问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have recently emerged as an intriguing
paradigm for human-computer interaction, capable of automatically executing
user instructions to operate intelligent terminal devices. However, when
encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) instructions that violate environmental
constraints or exceed the current capabilities of agents, GUI agents may suffer
task breakdowns or even pose security threats. Therefore, effective OOD
detection for GUI agents is essential. Traditional OOD detection methods
perform suboptimally in this domain due to the complex embedding space and
evolving GUI environments. In this work, we observe that the in-distribution
input semantic space of GUI agents exhibits a clustering pattern with respect
to the distance from the centroid. Based on the finding, we propose GEM, a
novel method based on fitting a Gaussian mixture model over input embedding
distances extracted from the GUI Agent that reflect its capability boundary.
Evaluated on eight datasets spanning smartphones, computers, and web browsers,
our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.70\% over the
best-performing baseline. Analysis verifies the generalization ability of our
method through experiments on nine different backbones. The codes are available

Abstract: Reconstruction and joint embedding have emerged as two leading paradigms in
Self Supervised Learning (SSL). Reconstruction methods focus on recovering the
original sample from a different view in input space. On the other hand, joint
embedding methods align the representations of different views in latent space.
Both approaches offer compelling advantages, yet practitioners lack clear
guidelines for choosing between them. In this work, we unveil the core
mechanisms that distinguish each paradigm. By leveraging closed form solutions
for both approaches, we precisely characterize how the view generation process,
e.g. data augmentation, impacts the learned representations. We then
demonstrate that, unlike supervised learning, both SSL paradigms require a
minimal alignment between augmentations and irrelevant features to achieve
asymptotic optimality with increasing sample size. Our findings indicate that
in scenarios where these irrelevant features have a large magnitude, joint
embedding methods are preferable because they impose a strictly weaker
alignment condition compared to reconstruction based methods. These results not
only clarify the trade offs between the two paradigms but also substantiate the
empirical success of joint embedding approaches on real world challenging
datasets.

Conclusion: AFCL为联邦持续学习提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) enables distributed clients to
collaboratively train a global model from online task streams in dynamic
real-world scenarios. However, existing FCL methods face challenges of both
spatial data heterogeneity among distributed clients and temporal data
heterogeneity across online tasks. Such data heterogeneity significantly
degrades the model performance with severe spatial-temporal catastrophic
forgetting of local and past knowledge. In this paper, we identify that the
root cause of this issue lies in the inherent vulnerability and sensitivity of
gradients to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a
gradient-free method, named Analytic Federated Continual Learning (AFCL), by
deriving analytical (i.e., closed-form) solutions from frozen extracted
features. In local training, our AFCL enables single-epoch learning with only a
lightweight forward-propagation process for each client. In global aggregation,
the server can recursively and efficiently update the global model with
single-round aggregation. Theoretical analyses validate that our AFCL achieves
spatio-temporal invariance of non-IID data. This ideal property implies that,
regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across local clients
and online tasks, the aggregated model of our AFCL remains invariant and
identical to that of centralized joint learning. Extensive experiments show the
consistent superiority of our AFCL over state-of-the-art baselines across
various benchmark datasets and settings.

Conclusion: C-ABL通过动态利用知识库结构，有效解决了ABL训练中的不稳定性问题，为逻辑与学习的结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Abductive Learning (ABL) integrates machine learning with logical reasoning
in a loop: a learning model predicts symbolic concept labels from raw inputs,
which are revised through abduction using domain knowledge and then fed back
for retraining. However, due to the nondeterminism of abduction, the training
process often suffers from instability, especially when the knowledge base is
large and complex, resulting in a prohibitively large abduction space. While
prior works focus on improving candidate selection within this space, they
typically treat the knowledge base as a static black box. In this work, we
propose Curriculum Abductive Learning (C-ABL), a method that explicitly
leverages the internal structure of the knowledge base to address the ABL
training challenges. C-ABL partitions the knowledge base into a sequence of
sub-bases, progressively introduced during training. This reduces the abduction
space throughout training and enables the model to incorporate logic in a
stepwise, smooth way. Experiments across multiple tasks show that C-ABL
outperforms previous ABL implementations, significantly improves training
stability, convergence speed, and final accuracy, especially under complex
knowledge setting.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using a densely
discretized spatial domain is a fundamental problem in various scientific and
engineering disciplines, including modeling climate phenomena and fluid
dynamics. However, performing these computations directly in the physical space
often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several
neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent
space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity,
they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly
sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast,
convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but
are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we
propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized
PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous
convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an
epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution
operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and
irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or
outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements
in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.

Abstract: Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are critical segments of an
antibody that facilitate binding to specific antigens. Current computational

binding energy optimization is done through computationally expensive Online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipelines rely heavily on unreliable binding energy
estimators. In this paper, we propose AbFlowNet, a novel generative framework

as a state in the GFlowNet framework, AbFlowNet jointly optimizes standard
diffusion losses and binding energy by directly incorporating energy signals
into the training process, thereby unifying diffusion and reward optimization
in a single procedure. Experimental results show that AbFlowNet outperforms the
base diffusion model by 3.06% in amino acid recovery, 20.40% in geometric

Abstract: Image Generation models are a trending topic nowadays, with many people
utilizing Artificial Intelligence models in order to generate images. There are
many such models which, given a prompt of a text, will generate an image which
depicts said prompt. There are many image generation models, such as Latent
Diffusion Models, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, Generative
Adversarial Networks and many more. When generating images, these models can
generate sensitive image data, which can be threatening to privacy or may
violate copyright laws of private entities. Machine unlearning aims at removing
the influence of specific data subsets from the trained models and in the case
of image generation models, remove the influence of a concept such that the
model is unable to generate said images of the concept when prompted.
Conventional retraining of the model can take upto days, hence fast algorithms
are the need of the hour. In this paper we propose an algorithm that aims to
remove the influence of concepts in diffusion models through updating the
gradients of the final layers of the text encoders. Using a weighted loss
function, we utilize backpropagation in order to update the weights of the
final layers of the Text Encoder componet of the Stable Diffusion Model,
removing influence of the concept from the text-image embedding space, such
that when prompted, the result is an image not containing the concept. The
weighted loss function makes use of Textual Inversion and Low-Rank
Adaptation.We perform our experiments on Latent Diffusion Models, namely the
Stable Diffusion v2 model, with an average concept unlearning runtime of 50
seconds using 4-5 images.

organizational charts to legal codes and knowledge graphs. Residual
Quantization (RQ) is widely used to generate discrete, multitoken
representations for such data by iteratively quantizing residuals in a
multilevel codebook. However, its reliance on Euclidean geometry can introduce
fundamental mismatches that hinder modeling of hierarchical branching,
necessary for faithful representation of hierarchical data. In this work, we
propose Hyperbolic Residual Quantization (HRQ), which embeds data natively in a
hyperbolic manifold and performs residual quantization using hyperbolic
operations and distance metrics. By adapting the embedding network, residual
computation, and distance metric to hyperbolic geometry, HRQ imparts an
inductive bias that aligns naturally with hierarchical branching. We claim that
HRQ in comparison to RQ can generate more useful for downstream tasks discrete
hierarchical representations for data with latent hierarchies. We evaluate HRQ
on two tasks: supervised hierarchy modeling using WordNet hypernym trees, where
the model is supervised to learn the latent hierarchy - and hierarchy
discovery, where, while latent hierarchy exists in the data, the model is not
directly trained or evaluated on a task related to the hierarchy. Across both
scenarios, HRQ hierarchical tokens yield better performance on downstream tasks
compared to Euclidean RQ with gains of up to $20\%$ for the hierarchy modeling
task. Our results demonstrate that integrating hyperbolic geometry into
discrete representation learning substantially enhances the ability to capture
latent hierarchies.

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto model for
learning from structured data, their decisional process remains opaque to the
end user, undermining their deployment in safety-critical applications. In the
case of graph classification, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
techniques address this major issue by identifying sub-graph motifs that
explain predictions. However, advancements in this field are hindered by a
chronic scarcity of benchmark datasets with known ground-truth motifs to assess
the explanations' quality. Current graph XAI benchmarks are limited to
synthetic data or a handful of real-world tasks hand-curated by domain experts.
In this paper, we propose a general method to automate the construction of XAI
benchmarks for graph classification from real-world datasets. We provide both
15 ready-made benchmarks, as well as the code to generate more than 2000
additional XAI benchmarks with our method. As a use case, we employ our
benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of some popular graph explainers.

of large-scale, real-time, multi-modal, and socially interactive datasets that
reflect the sensory-motor complexity of natural environments. To address this,
we present PLAICraft, a novel data collection platform and dataset capturing
multiplayer Minecraft interactions across five time-aligned modalities: video,
game output audio, microphone input audio, mouse, and keyboard actions. Each
modality is logged with millisecond time precision, enabling the study of
synchronous, embodied behaviour in a rich, open-ended world. The dataset
comprises over 10,000 hours of gameplay from more than 10,000 global

an initial 200-hour subset of the dataset, with plans to release most of the

benchmarking model capabilities in object recognition, spatial awareness,

Motivation: 数据增强在单源域泛化中广泛使用，但性能波动问题阻碍了模型选择。作者认为波动源于模型无法积累多样化增强的知识，导致特征扭曲。

Result: 实验表明PEER有效减少了OOD性能波动，并在多个数据集上实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: PEER通过简单随机增强超越了复杂数据增强策略的先前方法。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a popular tool for single source domain generalization,
which expands the source domain by generating simulated ones, improving
generalization on unseen target domains. In this work, we show that the
performance of such augmentation-based methods in the target domains
universally fluctuates during training, posing challenges in model selection
under realistic scenarios. We argue that the fluctuation stems from the
inability of the model to accumulate the knowledge learned from diverse
augmentations, exacerbating feature distortion during training. Based on this
observation, we propose a novel generalization method, coined Parameter-Space
Ensemble with Entropy Regularization (PEER), that uses a proxy model to learn
the augmented data on behalf of the main model. The main model is updated by
averaging its parameters with the proxy model, progressively accumulating
knowledge over the training steps. Maximizing the mutual information between
the output representations of the two models guides the learning process of the
proxy model, mitigating feature distortion during training. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of PEER in reducing the OOD performance
fluctuation and enhancing generalization across various datasets, including
PACS, Digits, Office-Home, and VLCS. Notably, our method with simple random
augmentation achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior approaches
on sDG that utilize complex data augmentation strategies.

Conclusion: 结合生成建模与领域物理知识是改进数据同化系统的有效方向。

Abstract: Data Assimilation (DA) plays a critical role in atmospheric science by
reconstructing spatially continous estimates of the system state, which serves
as initial conditions for scientific analysis. While recent advances in
diffusion models have shown great potential for DA tasks, most existing
approaches remain purely data-driven and often overlook the physical laws that
govern complex atmospheric dynamics. As a result, they may yield physically
inconsistent reconstructions that impair downstream applications. To overcome
this limitation, we propose PhyDA, a physics-guided diffusion framework
designed to ensure physical coherence in atmospheric data assimilation. PhyDA
introduces two key components: (1) a Physically Regularized Diffusion Objective
that integrates physical constraints into the training process by penalizing
deviations from known physical laws expressed as partial differential
equations, and (2) a Virtual Reconstruction Encoder that bridges observational
sparsity for structured latent representations, further enhancing the model's
ability to infer complete and physically coherent states. Experiments on the
ERA5 reanalysis dataset demonstrate that PhyDA achieves superior accuracy and
better physical plausibility compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our
results emphasize the importance of combining generative modeling with
domain-specific physical knowledge and show that PhyDA offers a promising
direction for improving real-world data assimilation systems.

Conclusion: Sinusoidal initialization通过结构化方法取代随机性，为深度学习系统提供了更强大和可靠的基础。

Abstract: Initialization plays a critical role in Deep Neural Network training,
directly influencing convergence, stability, and generalization. Common
approaches such as Glorot and He initializations rely on randomness, which can
produce uneven weight distributions across layer connections. In this paper, we
introduce the Sinusoidal initialization, a novel deterministic method that
employs sinusoidal functions to construct structured weight matrices expressly
to improve the spread and balance of weights throughout the network while
simultaneously fostering a more uniform, well-conditioned distribution of
neuron activation states from the very first forward pass. Because Sinusoidal
initialization begins with weights and activations that are already evenly and
efficiently utilized, it delivers consistently faster convergence, greater
training stability, and higher final accuracy across a wide range of models,
including convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and large
language models. On average, our experiments show an increase of 4.8 % in final
validation accuracy and 20.9 % in convergence speed. By replacing randomness
with structure, this initialization provides a stronger and more reliable
foundation for Deep Learning systems.

Conclusion: LiBOG为MetaBBO提供了一种有效的终身学习解决方案，适用于动态问题分布的场景。

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) garners attention due to its success in
automating the configuration and generation of black-box optimizers,
significantly reducing the human effort required for optimizer design and
discovering optimizers with higher performance than classic human-designed
optimizers. However, existing MetaBBO methods conduct one-off training under
the assumption that a stationary problem distribution with extensive and
representative training problem samples is pre-available. This assumption is
often impractical in real-world scenarios, where diverse problems following
shifting distribution continually arise. Consequently, there is a pressing need
for methods that can continuously learn from new problems encountered
on-the-fly and progressively enhance their capabilities. In this work, we
explore a novel paradigm of lifelong learning in MetaBBO and introduce LiBOG, a
novel approach designed to learn from sequentially encountered problems and
generate high-performance optimizers for Black-Box Optimization (BBO). LiBOG
consolidates knowledge both across tasks and within tasks to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate LiBOG's
effectiveness in learning to generate high-performance optimizers in a lifelong
learning manner, addressing catastrophic forgetting while maintaining
plasticity to learn new tasks.

Abstract: The rise of time-series pre-trained models has advanced temporal
representation learning, but current state-of-the-art models are often
large-scale, requiring substantial compute. We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact
time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform
strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval
tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels.
At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction,
learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals.
This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both
detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic
embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic
embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is
important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens,
a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also
introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from
multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary
model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves
zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task
innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains:
5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly
detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series
retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters,
making TSPulse 10-100X smaller than existing pre-trained models. Its efficiency
enables GPU-free inference and rapid pre-training, setting a new standard for
efficient time-series pre-trained models. Models will be open-sourced soon.

Abstract: We propose a novel benchmarking methodology for graph neural networks (GNNs)
based on the graph alignment problem, a combinatorial optimization task that
generalizes graph isomorphism by aligning two unlabeled graphs to maximize
overlapping edges. We frame this problem as a self-supervised learning task and
present several methods to generate graph alignment datasets using synthetic
random graphs and real-world graph datasets from multiple domains. For a given
graph dataset, we generate a family of graph alignment datasets with increasing
difficulty, allowing us to rank the performance of various architectures. Our
experiments indicate that anisotropic graph neural networks outperform standard
convolutional architectures. To further demonstrate the utility of the graph
alignment task, we show its effectiveness for unsupervised GNN pre-training,
where the learned node embeddings outperform other positional encodings on
three molecular regression tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results on the
PCQM4Mv2 dataset with significantly fewer parameters. To support
reproducibility and further research, we provide an open-source Python package
to generate graph alignment datasets and benchmark new GNN architectures.

Abstract: To forecast traffic with both spatial and temporal dimensions, we unroll a
mixed-graph-based optimization algorithm into a lightweight and interpretable
transformer-like neural net. Specifically, we construct two graphs: an
undirected graph $\mathcal{G}^u$ capturing spatial correlations across
geography, and a directed graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ capturing sequential
relationships over time. We formulate a prediction problem for the future
samples of signal $\mathbf{x}$, assuming it is "smooth" with respect to both
$\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, where we design new $\ell_2$ and
$\ell_1$-norm variational terms to quantify and promote signal smoothness
(low-frequency reconstruction) on a directed graph. We construct an iterative
algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and
unroll it into a feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. We
insert graph learning modules for $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, which
are akin to the self-attention mechanism in classical transformers. Experiments
show that our unrolled networks achieve competitive traffic forecast
performance as state-of-the-art prediction schemes, while reducing parameter
counts drastically. Our code is available in

Abstract: We introduce TimeSeriesGym, a scalable benchmarking framework for evaluating
Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents on time series machine learning engineering
challenges. Existing benchmarks lack scalability, focus narrowly on model
building in well-defined settings, and evaluate only a limited set of research
artifacts (e.g., CSV submission files). To make AI agent benchmarking more
relevant to the practice of machine learning engineering, our framework scales
along two critical dimensions. First, recognizing that effective ML engineering
requires a range of diverse skills, TimeSeriesGym incorporates challenges from
diverse sources spanning multiple domains and tasks. We design challenges to
evaluate both isolated capabilities (including data handling, understanding
research repositories, and code translation) and their combinations, and rather
than addressing each challenge independently, we develop tools that support
designing multiple challenges at scale. Second, we implement evaluation
mechanisms for multiple research artifacts, including submission files, code,
and models, using both precise numeric measures and more flexible LLM-based
evaluation approaches. This dual strategy balances objective assessment with
contextual judgment. Although our initial focus is on time series applications,
our framework can be readily extended to other data modalities, broadly
enhancing the comprehensiveness and practical utility of agentic AI evaluation.
We open-source our benchmarking framework to facilitate future research on the
ML engineering capabilities of AI agents.

Abstract: Contemporary models of high dimensional physical systems are constrained by
the curse of dimensionality and a reliance on dense data. We introduce KHRONOS
(Kernel Expansion Hierarchy for Reduced Order, Neural Optimized Surrogates), an
AI framework for model based, model free and model inversion tasks. KHRONOS
constructs continuously differentiable target fields with a hierarchical
composition of per-dimension kernel expansions, which are tensorized into modes
and then superposed. We evaluate KHRONOS on a canonical 2D, Poisson equation
benchmark: across 16 to 512 degrees of freedom (DoFs), it obtained L2 square
errors of 5e-4 down to 6e-10. This represents a 100 time gain over Kolmogorov
Arnold Networks (which itself reports a 100 times improvement on MLPs/PINNs
with 100 times fewer parameters) when controlling for the number of parameters.
This also represents a 1e4 times improvement in L2 square error compared to
standard linear FEM at comparable DoFs. Inference complexity is dominated by
inner products, yielding sub-millisecond full-field predictions that scale to
an arbitrary resolution. For inverse problems, KHRONOS facilitates rapid,
iterative level set recovery in only a few forward evaluations, with
sub-microsecond per sample latency. KHRONOS scalability, expressivity, and
interpretability open new avenues in constrained edge computing, online
control, computer vision, and beyond.

Conclusion: 本文的理论结果为m-out-of-n bootstrap在样本分位数估计中的可靠性提供了严格支持，并展示了其在实际统计和学习任务中的实用性。

Abstract: The m-out-of-n bootstrap, originally proposed by Bickel, Gotze, and Zwet
(1992), approximates the distribution of a statistic by repeatedly drawing m
subsamples (with m much smaller than n) without replacement from an original
sample of size n. It is now routinely used for robust inference with
heavy-tailed data, bandwidth selection, and other large-sample applications.
Despite its broad applicability across econometrics, biostatistics, and machine
learning, rigorous parameter-free guarantees for the soundness of the
m-out-of-n bootstrap when estimating sample quantiles have remained elusive.
  This paper establishes such guarantees by analyzing the estimator of sample
quantiles obtained from m-out-of-n resampling of a dataset of size n. We first
prove a central limit theorem for a fully data-driven version of the estimator
that holds under a mild moment condition and involves no unknown nuisance
parameters. We then show that the moment assumption is essentially tight by
constructing a counter-example in which the CLT fails. Strengthening the
assumptions slightly, we derive an Edgeworth expansion that provides exact
convergence rates and, as a corollary, a Berry Esseen bound on the bootstrap
approximation error. Finally, we illustrate the scope of our results by
deriving parameter-free asymptotic distributions for practical statistics,
including the quantiles for random walk Metropolis-Hastings and the rewards of
ergodic Markov decision processes, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of our
theory in modern estimation and learning tasks.

Abstract: Advanced healthcare predictions offer significant improvements in patient
outcomes by leveraging predictive analytics. Existing works primarily utilize
various views of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, such as diagnoses, lab
tests, or clinical notes, for model training. These methods typically assume
the availability of complete EHR views and that the designed model could fully
leverage the potential of each view. However, in practice, random missing views
and view laziness present two significant challenges that hinder further
improvements in multi-view utilization. To address these challenges, we
introduce Diffmv, an innovative diffusion-based generative framework designed
to advance the exploitation of multiple views of EHR data. Specifically, to
address random missing views, we integrate various views of EHR data into a
unified diffusion-denoising framework, enriched with diverse contextual
conditions to facilitate progressive alignment and view transformation. To
mitigate view laziness, we propose a novel reweighting strategy that assesses
the relative advantages of each view, promoting a balanced utilization of
various data views within the model. Our proposed strategy achieves superior
performance across multiple health prediction tasks derived from three popular
datasets, including multi-view and multi-modality scenarios.

significant challenge to AI-driven research paradigms. Under few-shot learning
scenarios, the quality of molecular representations directly dictates the
theoretical upper limit of model performance. We present AdaptMol, a
prototypical network integrating Adaptive multimodal fusion for Molecular
representation. This framework employs a dual-level attention mechanism to
dynamically integrate global and local molecular features derived from two
modalities: SMILES sequences and molecular graphs. (1) At the local level,
structural features such as atomic interactions and substructures are extracted
from molecular graphs, emphasizing fine-grained topological information; (2) At
the global level, the SMILES sequence provides a holistic representation of the
molecule. To validate the necessity of multimodal adaptive fusion, we propose
an interpretable approach based on identifying molecular active substructures
to demonstrate that multimodal adaptive fusion can efficiently represent
molecules. Extensive experiments on three commonly used benchmarks under 5-shot
and 10-shot settings demonstrate that AdaptMol achieves state-of-the-art
performance in most cases. The rationale-extracted method guides the fusion of
two modalities and highlights the importance of both modalities.

Result: 实验证明k*-means在未知k时显著优于现有方法，且运行时间具有竞争力。

Conclusion: k*-means是一种高效、自动化的聚类解决方案。

Abstract: Clustering is a widely used and powerful machine learning technique, but its
effectiveness is often limited by the need to specify the number of clusters,
k, or by relying on thresholds that implicitly determine k. We introduce
k*-means, a novel clustering algorithm that eliminates the need to set k or any
other parameters. Instead, it uses the minimum description length principle to
automatically determine the optimal number of clusters, k*, by splitting and
merging clusters while also optimising the standard k-means objective. We prove
that k*-means is guaranteed to converge and demonstrate experimentally that it
significantly outperforms existing methods in scenarios where k is unknown. We
also show that it is accurate in estimating k, and that empirically its runtime
is competitive with existing methods, and scales well with dataset size.

Abstract: Deep learning models have driven significant progress in predicting protein
function and interactions at the protein level. While these advancements have
been invaluable for many biological applications such as enzyme engineering and
function annotation, a more detailed perspective is essential for understanding
protein functional mechanisms and evaluating the biological knowledge captured
by models. To address this demand, we introduce VenusX, the first large-scale
benchmark for fine-grained functional annotation and function-based protein
pairing at the residue, fragment, and domain levels. VenusX comprises three
major task categories across six types of annotations, including residue-level
binary classification, fragment-level multi-class classification, and pairwise
functional similarity scoring for identifying critical active sites, binding
sites, conserved sites, motifs, domains, and epitopes. The benchmark features
over 878,000 samples curated from major open-source databases such as InterPro,
BioLiP, and SAbDab. By providing mixed-family and cross-family splits at three
sequence identity thresholds, our benchmark enables a comprehensive assessment
of model performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.
For baseline evaluation, we assess a diverse set of popular and open-source
models, including pre-trained protein language models, sequence-structure
hybrids, structure-based methods, and alignment-based techniques. Their
performance is reported across all benchmark datasets and evaluation settings
using multiple metrics, offering a thorough comparison and a strong foundation
for future research. Code and data are publicly available at

Abstract: Neural networks have become increasingly popular in the last few years as an
effective tool for the task of image classification due to the impressive
performance they have achieved on this task. In image classification tasks, it
is common to use data augmentation strategies to increase the robustness of
trained networks to changes in the input images and to avoid overfitting.
Although data augmentation is a widely adopted technique, the literature lacks
a body of research analyzing the effects data augmentation methods have on the
patterns learned by neural network models working on complex datasets. The
primary objective of this work is to propose a methodology and set of metrics
that may allow a quantitative approach to analyzing the effects of data
augmentation in convolutional networks applied to image classification. An
important tool used in the proposed approach lies in the concept of class
activation maps for said models, which allow us to identify and measure the
importance these models assign to each individual pixel in an image when
executing the classification task. From these maps, we may then extract metrics
over the similarities and differences between maps generated by these models
trained on a given dataset with different data augmentation strategies.
Experiments made using this methodology suggest that the effects of these data
augmentation techniques not only can be analyzed in this way but also allow us
to identify different impact profiles over the trained models.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental problem in domains such as healthcare,
manufacturing, and cybersecurity. This thesis proposes new unsupervised methods
for anomaly detection in both structured and streaming data settings. In the
first part, we focus on structure-based anomaly detection, where normal data
follows low-dimensional manifolds while anomalies deviate from them. We
introduce Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), which embeds data into a
high-dimensional preference space via manifold fitting, and isolates outliers
using two variants: Voronoi-iForest, based on geometric distances, and
RuzHash-iForest, leveraging Locality Sensitive Hashing for scalability. We also
propose Sliding-PIF, which captures local manifold information for streaming
scenarios. Our methods outperform existing techniques on synthetic and real
datasets. We extend this to structure-based clustering with MultiLink, a novel
method for recovering multiple geometric model families in noisy data.
MultiLink merges clusters via a model-aware linkage strategy, enabling robust
multi-class structure recovery. It offers key advantages over existing
approaches, such as speed, reduced sensitivity to thresholds, and improved
robustness to poor initial sampling. The second part of the thesis addresses
online anomaly detection in evolving data streams. We propose Online Isolation
Forest (Online-iForest), which uses adaptive, multi-resolution histograms and
dynamically updates tree structures to track changes over time. It avoids
retraining while achieving accuracy comparable to offline models, with superior
efficiency for real-time applications. Finally, we tackle anomaly detection in
cybersecurity via open-set recognition for malware classification. We enhance a
Gradient Boosting classifier with MaxLogit to detect unseen malware families, a
method now integrated into Cleafy's production system.

Abstract: Real-world systems, from aerospace to railway engineering, are modeled with
partial differential equations (PDEs) describing the physics of the system.
Estimating robust solutions for such problems is essential. Deep learning-based
architectures, such as neural PDE solvers, have recently gained traction as a
reliable solution method. The current state of development of these approaches,
however, primarily focuses on improving accuracy. The environmental impact of
excessive computation, leading to increased carbon emissions, has largely been
overlooked. This paper introduces a carbon emission measure for a range of PDE
solvers. Our proposed metric, EcoL2, balances model accuracy with emissions
across data collection, model training, and deployment. Experiments across both
physics-informed machine learning and operator learning architectures
demonstrate that the proposed metric presents a holistic assessment of model
performance and emission cost. As such solvers grow in scale and deployment,
EcoL2 represents a step toward building performant scientific machine learning
systems with lower long-term environmental impact.

Abstract: Conformal symmetries, i.e.\ coordinate transformations that preserve angles,
play a key role in many fields, including physics, mathematics, computer vision
and (geometric) machine learning. Here we build a neural network that is
equivariant under general conformal transformations. To achieve this, we lift
data from flat Euclidean space to Anti de Sitter (AdS) space. This allows us to
exploit a known correspondence between conformal transformations of flat space
and isometric transformations on the AdS space. We then build upon the fact
that such isometric transformations have been extensively studied on general
geometries in the geometric deep learning literature. We employ message-passing
layers conditioned on the proper distance, yielding a computationally efficient
framework. We validate our model on tasks from computer vision and statistical
physics, demonstrating strong performance, improved generalization capacities,
and the ability to extract conformal data such as scaling dimensions from the
trained network.

Abstract: Brain-inspired computing aims to mimic cognitive functions like associative
memory, the ability to recall complete patterns from partial cues. Memristor
technology offers promising hardware for such neuromorphic systems due to its
potential for efficient in-memory analog computing. Hopfield Neural Networks
(HNNs) are a classic model for associative memory, but implementations on
conventional hardware suffer from efficiency bottlenecks, while prior
memristor-based HNNs faced challenges with vulnerability to hardware defects
due to offline training, limited storage capacity, and difficulty processing
analog patterns. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate on integrated
memristor hardware a new hardware-adaptive learning algorithm for associative
memories that significantly improves defect tolerance and capacity, and
naturally extends to scalable multilayer architectures capable of handling both
binary and continuous patterns. Our approach achieves 3x effective capacity
under 50% device faults compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, its
extension to multilayer architectures enables superlinear capacity scaling
(\(\propto N^{1.49}\ for binary patterns) and effective recalling of continuous
patterns (\propto N^{1.74}\ scaling), as compared to linear capacity scaling
for previous HNNs. It also provides flexibility to adjust capacity by tuning
hidden neurons for the same-sized patterns. By leveraging the massive
parallelism of the hardware enabled by synchronous updates, it reduces energy
by 8.8x and latency by 99.7% for 64-dimensional patterns over asynchronous
schemes, with greater improvements at scale. This promises the development of
more reliable memristor-based associative memory systems and enables new
applications research due to the significantly improved capacity, efficiency,
and flexibility.

Abstract: Climate-economic modeling under uncertainty presents significant
computational challenges that may limit policymakers' ability to address
climate change effectively. This paper explores neural network-based approaches
for solving high-dimensional optimal control problems arising from models that
incorporate ambiguity aversion in climate mitigation decisions. We develop a
continuous-time endogenous-growth economic model that accounts for multiple
mitigation pathways, including emission-free capital and carbon intensity
reductions. Given the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of these
models, traditional numerical methods become computationally intractable. We
benchmark several neural network architectures against finite-difference
generated solutions, evaluating their ability to capture the dynamic
interactions between uncertainty, technology transitions, and optimal climate
policy. Our findings demonstrate that appropriate neural architecture selection
significantly impacts both solution accuracy and computational efficiency when
modeling climate-economic systems under uncertainty. These methodological
advances enable more sophisticated modeling of climate policy decisions,
allowing for better representation of technology transitions and
uncertainty-critical elements for developing effective mitigation strategies in
the face of climate change.

Abstract: Fine-grained economic mapping through urban representation learning has
emerged as a crucial tool for evidence-based economic decisions. While existing
methods primarily rely on supervised or unsupervised approaches, they often
overlook semi-supervised learning in data-scarce scenarios and lack unified
multi-task frameworks for comprehensive sectoral economic analysis. To address
these gaps, we propose SemiGTX, an explainable semi-supervised graph learning
framework for sectoral economic mapping. The framework is designed with
dedicated fusion encoding modules for various geospatial data modalities,
seamlessly integrating them into a cohesive graph structure. It introduces a
semi-information loss function that combines spatial self-supervision with
locally masked supervised regression, enabling more informative and effective
region representations. Through multi-task learning, SemiGTX concurrently maps
GDP across primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors within a unified model.
Extensive experiments conducted in the Pearl River Delta region of China
demonstrate the model's superior performance compared to existing methods,
achieving R2 scores of 0.93, 0.96, and 0.94 for the primary, secondary and
tertiary sectors, respectively. Cross-regional experiments in Beijing and
Chengdu further illustrate its generality. Systematic analysis reveals how
different data modalities influence model predictions, enhancing explainability
while providing valuable insights for regional development planning. This
representation learning framework advances regional economic monitoring through
diverse urban data integration, providing a robust foundation for precise
economic forecasting.
