### [1] [Confidence Estimation for Text-to-SQL in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14056)
*Sepideh Entezari Maleki,Mohammadreza Pourreza,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 85.0

TL;DR: 该论文研究LLM在文本到SQL任务中的置信度估计方法，比较了黑盒和白盒策略，发现基于一致性的黑盒方法和SQL语法感知的白盒方法效果最好，执行结果能进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在文本到SQL任务中的置信度估计问题，特别是在无法访问模型权重和梯度的约束条件下，评估不同置信度估计策略的有效性。

Method: 探索黑盒和白盒置信度估计策略，在跨域文本到SQL基准上评估其效果。黑盒方法主要基于一致性，白盒方法利用SQL语法感知技术解释LLM logits，并引入执行结果作为补充信号。

Result: 基于一致性的黑盒方法表现最佳，SQL语法感知的白盒方法在解释LLM logits方面具有优势，执行结果能有效提升两种方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM在文本到SQL任务中的可靠性评估提供了有效方法，特别是在模型访问受限的情况下，结合执行结果的置信度估计策略能显著提升性能。

Abstract: Confidence estimation for text-to-SQL aims to assess the reliability of
model-generated SQL queries without having access to gold answers. We study
this problem in the context of large language models (LLMs), where access to
model weights and gradients is often constrained. We explore both black-box and
white-box confidence estimation strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on
cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmarks. Our evaluation highlights the superior
performance of consistency-based methods among black-box models and the
advantage of SQL-syntax-aware approaches for interpreting LLM logits in
white-box settings. Furthermore, we show that execution-based grounding of
queries provides a valuable supplementary signal, improving the effectiveness
of both approaches.

TL;DR: 论文分析了LLM微调过程中的数据记忆化隐私风险，提出了多层隐私保护框架，在保持94.7%模型效用的同时将数据泄露降至0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在微调过程中容易记忆训练数据，导致严重的隐私泄露风险，特别是在重复敏感数据的情况下，隐私泄露率从0-5%激增至60-75%。

Method: 通过控制实验分析GPT-2、Phi-3和Gemma-2等现代LLM架构的数据记忆化现象，提出并评估四种隐私保护方法：语义数据去重、差分隐私生成、基于熵的过滤和基于模式的过滤。

Result: 实验表明提出的隐私保护框架能够将数据泄露率降至0%，同时保持94.7%的原始模型效用，相比基线64.2%的平均泄露率提升有显著改善。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM微调提供了有效的隐私保护解决方案，通过多层防护机制在保护隐私的同时维持模型性能，对可信AI发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their tendency to memorize
training data poses significant privacy risks, particularly during fine-tuning
processes. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of data
memorization in fine-tuned LLMs and introduces a novel multi-layered privacy
protection framework. Through controlled experiments on modern LLM
architectures including GPT-2, Phi-3, and Gemma-2, we demonstrate that
fine-tuning with repeated sensitive data increases privacy leakage rates from
baseline levels of 0-5% to 60-75%, representing a 64.2% average increase across
tested models. We propose and rigorously evaluate four complementary privacy
protection methods: semantic data deduplication, differential privacy during
generation, entropy-based filtering, and pattern-based content filtering. Our
experimental results show that these techniques can reduce data leakage to 0%
while maintaining 94.7% of original model utility.

TL;DR: 本文通过干预实验研究LLM中标点符号和不同推理规则的处理机制，发现在GPT-2中多个层标点符号是必要且充分的，但在DeepSeek和Gemma中不明显，且条件语句和全称量化处理方式不同。

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型中信息收集和传播的机制，特别是标点符号作为注意力汇和记忆辅助的计算重要性，以及不同输入组件和推理规则的处理方式。

Method: 使用基于干预的技术（互换干预和层交换实验），在GPT-2、DeepSeek和Gemma模型上评估标点符号的必要性和充分性，并分析条件语句和全称量化的处理差异。

Result: 发现模型特异性差异：GPT-2中多个层的标点符号是必要且充分的，而DeepSeek中较少，Gemma中完全不成立；条件语句和全称量化被不同方式处理。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM中标点使用和推理的内部机制，为可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper we explore where information is collected and how it is
propagated throughout layers in large language models (LLMs). We begin by
examining the surprising computational importance of punctuation tokens which
previous work has identified as attention sinks and memory aids. Using
intervention-based techniques, we evaluate the necessity and sufficiency (for
preserving model performance) of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2,
DeepSeek, and Gemma. Our results show stark model-specific differences: for
GPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while
this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Extending beyond
punctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g.,
subjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static
summaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to
changes in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we
investigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by
LLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping
experiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal
quantification (for all) are processed very differently. Our findings offer new
insight into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs
and have implications for interpretability.

### [4] [DLLMQuant: Quantizing Diffusion-based Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14090)
*Chen Xu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 85.0

TL;DR: DLLMQuant：针对扩散式大语言模型的后训练量化框架，解决了现有PTQ方法在DLLMs上的严重性能下降问题，通过时间-掩码自适应采样、交互感知激活量化和确定性引导量化三项技术实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型(DLLMs)在非自回归文本生成方面表现优异，但模型尺寸大、计算成本高限制了部署。现有后训练量化(PTQ)方法直接应用于DLLMs时会出现严重精度下降和泛化性能降低的问题。

Method: 提出DLLMQuant框架，包含三项核心技术：1)时间-掩码自适应采样(TMAS)：考虑时间和掩码因素的校准方法；2)交互感知激活量化(IA-AQ)：利用双向注意力交互信号动态分配量化资源；3)确定性引导量化(CGQ)：整合掩码状态和token分数作为误差补偿的加权标准。

Result: 实验表明DLLMQuant在保持效率的同时实现了显著的性能提升，解决了现有PTQ方法在DLLMs上高达16%的精度下降问题。

Conclusion: DLLMQuant是针对DLLMs量身定制的有效PTQ解决方案，解决了动态掩码、迭代生成和双向注意力等核心机制与量化的冲突问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have shown promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, but their deployment is constrained by
large model sizes and heavy computational costs. Post-training quantization
(PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language
Models (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced
generalization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a
16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key
mechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -
clash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation
and dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding
steps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;
2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during
iteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps
progress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,
making overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To
address these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,
which incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling
(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with
the capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware
Activation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's
interaction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)
Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token
scores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight
quantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves
significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的论文评审任务缺乏统一的评估基准，特别是在处理包含图表等多模态内容的场景时，无法系统评估模型生成全面、准确且符合人类偏好的评审意见的能力。

Method: 构建包含多模态内容和专家撰写评审意见的跨学科基准数据集，设计13个任务分为四个核心类别：逐步评审生成、结果制定、人类偏好对齐和对抗鲁棒性，对16个开源模型和5个先进闭源模型进行广泛实验。

Result: 实验结果表明该基准能够全面评估各种模型在学术论文评审任务上的性能，为自动化同行评审系统的发展提供了标准化基础。

Conclusion: MMReview是建立自动化同行评审系统标准化基础的关键一步，填补了多模态学术内容评审评估的空白。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an
essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the
generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a
unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to
produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in
scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address
this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans
multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and
expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within
four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences,
Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks
grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs
and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome
formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial
input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models
and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the
benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a
standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

TL;DR: DPad是一种无需训练的方法，通过滑动窗口和距离衰减dropout策略，显著减少扩散大语言模型的计算冗余，实现61.4倍加速同时保持准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型在并行文本生成时存在高计算开销问题，因为每个步骤都需要预测所有未来后缀token但只保留一小部分，导致大量冗余计算

Method: 提出Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad)方法，包含两种策略：1) 固定长度的滑动窗口限制注意力范围；2) 距离衰减dropout确定性地移除远距离后缀token

Result: 在LLaDA-1.5和Dream模型上的多基准测试显示，DPad相比原始dLLMs实现最高61.4倍加速，同时保持相当的准确性

Conclusion: DPad为高效可扩展的长序列推理提供了有效解决方案，兼容现有优化技术且代码实现简单

Abstract: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by
framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational
overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while
retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a
training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix
tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two
strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window,
and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix
tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with
existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only
a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on
LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to
$\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable
accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence
inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/Crys-Chen/DPad.

Abstract: As researchers increasingly adopt LLMs as writing assistants, generating
high-quality research paper introductions remains both challenging and
essential. We introduce Scientific Introduction Generation (SciIG), a task that
evaluates LLMs' ability to produce coherent introductions from titles,
abstracts, and related works. Curating new datasets from NAACL 2025 and ICLR
2025 papers, we assess five state-of-the-art models, including both open-source

closed-source GPT-4o systems, across multiple dimensions: lexical overlap,
semantic similarity, content coverage, faithfulness, consistency, citation
correctness, and narrative quality. Our comprehensive framework combines
automated metrics with LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. Results demonstrate LLaMA-4
Maverick's superior performance on most metrics, particularly in semantic
similarity and faithfulness. Moreover, three-shot prompting consistently
outperforms fewer-shot approaches. These findings provide practical insights
into developing effective research writing assistants and set realistic
expectations for LLM-assisted academic writing. To foster reproducibility and
future research, we will publicly release all code and datasets.

Conclusion: Finch-Zk为生产LLM系统提供了实用的、可部署的安全保障，能够显著增强事实可靠性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating
content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present
Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model
consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without
requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations:
1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained
inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from
semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that
applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate
content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination
detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation,
Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy
on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama
4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models
demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for
enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.

Motivation: 现有方法存在训练开销大和演示样本不一致的问题，导致LLM工具调用行为不准确，需要更高效准确的解决方案

Method: 构建包含调用/不调用行为的语料库，使用对比学习框架训练BAR，采用定制正负样本对和双负对比损失

Result: 实验表明该方法显著减少错误函数调用，同时保持高任务性能

Conclusion: BAR为工具增强LLM提供了成本效益高且高效的解决方案

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverage external functions to
extend their capabilities, but inaccurate function calls can lead to
inefficiencies and increased costs.Existing methods address this challenge by
fine-tuning LLMs or using demonstration-based prompting, yet they often suffer
from high training overhead and fail to account for inconsistent demonstration
samples, which misguide the model's invocation behavior. In this paper, we
trained a behavior-aligned retriever (BAR), which provides behaviorally
consistent demonstrations to help LLMs make more accurate tool-using decisions.
To train the BAR, we construct a corpus including different function-calling
behaviors, i.e., calling or non-calling.We use the contrastive learning
framework to train the BAR with customized positive/negative pairs and a
dual-negative contrastive loss, ensuring robust retrieval of behaviorally
consistent examples.Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces erroneous function calls while maintaining high task performance,
offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for tool-augmented LLMs.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
decision-critical domains, it becomes essential to ensure that their confidence
estimates faithfully correspond to their actual correctness. Existing
calibration methods have primarily focused on post-hoc adjustments or auxiliary
model training; however, many of these approaches necessitate additional
supervision or parameter updates. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-based
calibration framework inspired by the Credence Calibration Game. Our method
establishes a structured interaction loop wherein LLMs receive feedback based
on the alignment of their predicted confidence with correctness. Through
feedback-driven prompting and natural language summaries of prior performance,
our framework dynamically improves model calibration. Extensive experiments
across models and game configurations demonstrate consistent improvements in
evaluation metrics. Our results highlight the potential of game-based prompting
as an effective strategy for LLM calibration. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 现有LLM方法主要关注关系分类，但在判断关系是否存在时容易产生虚假预测，特别是在复杂句子结构和语义情况下，这会损害知识图谱的完整性和下游应用的可靠性

Conclusion: DEPTH通过依赖感知简化和层次化精炼有效解决了LLM在关系抽取中的幻觉问题，提高了知识图谱构建的可靠性

Abstract: Relation extraction enables the construction of structured knowledge for many
downstream applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown great
promise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation
classification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related
entity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine
whether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence
structures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such
hallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the
integrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these
challenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware
sEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the
relation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,
DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for
each pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence
into a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise
while preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local
predictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,
correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a
causality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling
spurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning
with human feedback. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DEPTH
reduces the average hallucination rate to 7.0\% while achieving a 17.2\%
improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: LLM具有隐式的自我识别能力，但需要特定方法才能唤醒。CoSur框架有效解决了IPP下的识别困难，为LLM的自我认知研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to possess a degree of
self-recognition capability-the ability to identify whether a given text was
generated by themselves. Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is
reliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model
is presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However,
performance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm
(IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although
this phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been
systematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to
confirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under
IPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a
phenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent
ability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which
remains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we
propose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main
modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship
discrimination and cognitive editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method improves the performance of three different LLMs in the IPP
scenario, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01%,
respectively.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problems of missing reasoning chains and
insufficient entity-level semantic understanding in large language models when
dealing with tasks that require structured knowledge. It proposes a fine-tuning
algorithm framework based on knowledge graph injection. The method builds on
pretrained language models and introduces structured graph information for
auxiliary learning. A graph neural network is used to encode entities and their
relations, constructing a graph-based semantic representation. A fusion
mechanism is then designed to jointly model the knowledge graph embeddings with
the contextual representations from the language model. To enhance the
robustness of knowledge integration, a gating mechanism is introduced to
dynamically balance the contributions of linguistic semantics and structural
knowledge. This effectively mitigates conflicts between different
representational spaces. During training, a joint loss function is constructed
to account for both task performance and structural alignment objectives. This
helps improve the accuracy of entity prediction and semantic reasoning. The
study also includes a series of systematic sensitivity experiments. It
evaluates the effects of learning rate, graph coverage, and structural
perturbations on model performance. The results further validate the
effectiveness and stability of the proposed method across tasks such as entity
recognition, question answering, and language generation. Experimental findings
show that the proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework significantly
enhances the model's ability to represent complex semantic units. It
demonstrates better semantic consistency and contextual logic modeling in

Motivation: 针对推理工作负载中长思维轨迹生成的需求，设计高效架构来提高推理吞吐量，同时保持与同规模模型相当的准确性。

Method: 采用Nemotron-H混合架构，用Mamba-2层替换大部分自注意力层；先预训练12B参数基础模型，然后通过Minitron策略进行压缩和蒸馏，支持单GPU上128k tokens推理。

Result: 在推理基准测试中达到与Qwen3-8B等模型相当或更好的准确性，同时在8k输入16k输出的推理场景中实现高达6倍的推理吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: 混合Mamba-Transformer架构能够有效平衡推理性能和准确性，为高效推理工作负载提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model
designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models.
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the
majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture
are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when
generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model
(Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe.
After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to
compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to
128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision).
Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks
while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like
8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2,
Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with
the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.

Motivation: 研究发现大型语言模型在类比学习（ICL）方面存在局限性，特别是在处理一阶量词（如all、some）和线性函数的上下文学习任务时，Softmax函数被认为是导致这些限制的因素之一

Method: 提出scaled signed averaging (SSA)作为Softmax的新替代方案，在编码器和解码器Transformer模型中进行评估，并与基于Softmax的模型进行对比

Result: 实证结果显示SSA在目标任务上显著提升性能，在各种语言探测任务中匹配或超越了基于Softmax的对应模型

Conclusion: SSA是Softmax的有效替代方案，能够解决Transformer模型在特定推理任务中的局限性，提升模型的语言理解和推理能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity to learn by
analogy, known as in-context learning (ICL). However, recent studies have
revealed limitations in this ability. In this paper, we examine these
limitations on tasks involving first-order quantifiers such as {\em all} and
{\em some}, as well as on ICL with linear functions. We identify Softmax, the
scoring function in attention mechanism, as a contributing factor to these
constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{scaled signed averaging
(SSA)}, a novel alternative to Softmax. Empirical results show that SSA
dramatically improves performance on our target tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate
both encoder-only and decoder-only transformers models with SSA, demonstrating
that they match or exceed their Softmax-based counterparts across a variety of
linguistic probing tasks.

Conclusion: 当前LLM跨语言推理既有潜力又很脆弱，代码切换是提高多语言鲁棒性的有希望的手段。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in multilingual
contexts, yet their capacity for consistent, logically grounded alignment
across languages remains underexplored. We present a controlled evaluation
framework for multilingual natural language inference (NLI) that generates
synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a
typologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control
over semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and
mixed-language (code-switched) conditions. Surprisingly, code-switching does
not degrade, and can even improve, performance, suggesting that
translation-induced lexical variation may serve as a regularization signal. We
validate semantic preservation through embedding-based similarity analyses and
cross-lingual alignment visualizations, confirming the fidelity of translated
pairs. Our findings expose both the potential and the brittleness of current
LLM cross-lingual reasoning, and identify code-switching as a promising lever
for improving multilingual robustness. Code available at:

Abstract: Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple
tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand
prediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key
limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and
data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while
large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural
language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical
reasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose
TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal
modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our
approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex
dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph
attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured
embeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via
reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input
characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework
operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,
dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and
projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to
generate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three
tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised
and zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers
competitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing
strong generalization and cross-task adaptability. Our code is available at

Abstract: Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked
impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the
reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct
translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen
2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT
generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments
reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot
language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves
performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and
proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning
remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but
does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune
using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third,
data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully
curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier
corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results
clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated
datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown
impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research
systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking
and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown
impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain
challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited
accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model
lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the
framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored
for medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses
these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data
synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest
chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex
multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private
medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate
medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse

fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our
MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing
new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining
competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates
that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种轻量级、无参考、语言无关且执行无关的代码生成评估工具，运行时间为O(n,d)且无需外部测试

Abstract: Assessing the stability of code generation from large language models (LLMs)
is essential for judging their reliability in real-world development. We extend
prior "structural-entropy concepts" to the program domain by pairing entropy
with abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis. For any fixed prompt, we collect the
multiset of depth-bounded subtrees of AST in each generated program and treat
their relative frequencies as a probability distribution. We then measure
stability in two complementary ways: (i) Jensen-Shannon divergence, a
symmetric, bounded indicator of structural overlap, and (ii) a Structural
Cross-Entropy ratio that highlights missing high-probability patterns. Both
metrics admit structural-only and token-aware variants, enabling separate views
on control-flow shape and identifier-level variability. Unlike pass@k, BLEU, or
CodeBLEU, our metrics are reference-free, language-agnostic, and
execution-independent. We benchmark several leading LLMs on standard code
generation tasks, demonstrating that AST-driven structural entropy reveals
nuances in model consistency and robustness. The method runs in O(n,d) time
with no external tests, providing a lightweight addition to the code-generation
evaluation toolkit.

Conclusion: 研究结果为可持续AI发展提供了实用见解，帮助研究者、从业者和政策制定者在NLP应用中平衡性能与资源效率

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks raises concerns about energy efficiency and
sustainability. While prior research has largely focused on energy consumption
during model training, the inference phase has received comparatively less
attention. This study systematically evaluates the trade-offs between model
accuracy and energy consumption in text classification inference across various
model architectures and hardware configurations. Our empirical analysis shows
that the best-performing model in terms of accuracy can also be
energy-efficient, while larger LLMs tend to consume significantly more energy
with lower classification accuracy. We observe substantial variability in
inference energy consumption ($<$mWh to $>$kWh), influenced by model type,
model size, and hardware specifications. Additionally, we find a strong
correlation between inference energy consumption and model runtime, indicating
that execution time can serve as a practical proxy for energy usage in settings
where direct measurement is not feasible. These findings have implications for
sustainable AI development, providing actionable insights for researchers,
industry practitioners, and policymakers seeking to balance performance and

Abstract: Connecting LLMs with formal knowledge representation and reasoning is a
promising approach to address their shortcomings. Embeddings and sparse
autoencoders are widely used to represent textual content, but the semantics
are entangled with syntactic and language-specific information. We propose a
method that isolates concept semantics in Large Langue Models by averaging
concept activations derived via Sparse Autoencoders. We create English text
representations from OWL ontology classes, translate the English into French
and Chinese and then pass these texts as prompts to the Gemma 2B LLM. Using the
open source Gemma Scope suite of Sparse Autoencoders, we obtain concept
activations for each class and language version. We average the different
language activations to derive a conceptual average. We then correlate the
conceptual averages with a ground truth mapping between ontology classes. Our
results give a strong indication that the conceptual average aligns to the true
relationship between classes when compared with a single language by itself.
The result hints at a new technique which enables mechanistic interpretation of
internal network states with higher accuracy.

Abstract: Survey papers play a critical role in scientific communication by

However, existing LLM-based approaches often struggle with maintaining
coherence across long, multi-section surveys and providing comprehensive
citation coverage. To address these limitations, we introduce SurveyGen-I, an
automatic survey generation framework that combines coarse-to-fine retrieval,
adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation. SurveyGen-I first performs
survey-level retrieval to construct the initial outline and writing plan, and
then dynamically refines both during generation through a memory mechanism that
stores previously written content and terminology, ensuring coherence across
subsections. When the system detects insufficient context, it triggers
fine-grained subsection-level retrieval. During generation, SurveyGen-I
leverages this memory mechanism to maintain coherence across subsections.
Experiments across four scientific domains demonstrate that SurveyGen-I
consistently outperforms previous works in content quality, consistency, and
citation coverage.

Abstract: Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their
potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored
due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2)
the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking,
listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond
the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present
ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data
scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text
and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and
physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to
achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect
recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for
Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that
ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger
proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among
existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities
like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal
perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly
available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.

Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)通常很长、嘈杂且冗余，超出了现有LLMs的上下文窗口限制。需要找到高效的方法来处理这些长文本，同时保持性能。

Method: 设计了三种可复制的临床任务，使用真实住院患者的EHRs，测试了三种最先进的LLMs在不同上下文量下的表现，比较了目标文本检索和最近临床笔记两种方法。

Result: RAG方法在使用显著更少输入token的情况下，性能接近或超过了使用完整上下文的方法，与使用最近笔记的方法相当或更好。

Conclusion: 即使新模型能够处理更长的文本，RAG仍然是一种具有竞争力的高效方法。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are long, noisy, and often redundant, posing
a major challenge for the clinicians who must navigate them. Large language
models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this
unstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even
state-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages
from across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input
tokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable
across health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2)
generating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using
EHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs
with varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval
or the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds
the performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using
the models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our
results suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as
newer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a
promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language
generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding
strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains
challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.
While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted
technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing
diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of
activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that
dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit
quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority
of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model
variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,
quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this
multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization
behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide
a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and
experimental setups will be released to support the community.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have demonstrated
remarkable abilities in generating natural language. However, they also pose
security and integrity challenges. Existing countermeasures primarily focus on
distinguishing AI-generated content from human-written text, with most
solutions tailored for English. Meanwhile, authorship attribution--determining
which specific LLM produced a given text--has received comparatively little
attention despite its importance in forensic analysis. In this paper, we
present DA-MTL, a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously addresses
both text detection and authorship attribution. We evaluate DA-MTL on nine
datasets and four backbone models, demonstrating its strong performance across
multiple languages and LLM sources. Our framework captures each task's unique
characteristics and shares insights between them, which boosts performance in
both tasks. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis of cross-modal and
cross-lingual patterns and assess the framework's robustness against
adversarial obfuscation techniques. Our findings offer valuable insights into
LLM behavior and the generalization of both detection and authorship
attribution.

Conclusion: 该方法虽然以土耳其语为演示，但具有语言独立性，可适配其他语言，为构建更可解释和有效的多语言NLP系统提供了实用路径

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in natural language processing (NLP),
shaping how text is segmented and interpreted by language models. While subword
methods such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece have been effective,
they often struggle with morphologically rich and agglutinative languages
because they rely on frequency rather than linguistic structure. We introduce a
hybrid tokenization framework that combines rule-based morphological analysis
with statistical subword segmentation. The method uses phonological
normalization, root-affix dictionaries, and a novel algorithm that balances
morpheme preservation with vocabulary efficiency. It assigns shared identifiers
to phonologically variant affixes (e.g., -ler and -lar) and altered root forms
(e.g., kitap vs. kitab{\i}), reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic
integrity. Special tokens are added for whitespace and case, including an
UPPERCASE marker to avoid vocabulary inflation from capitalization. BPE is
integrated for out-of-vocabulary coverage without harming morphological
coherence. On the TR-MMLU benchmark, the tokenizer achieves the highest Turkish
Token Percentage (90.29\%) and Pure Token Percentage (85.8\%). Comparisons with
tokenizers from LLaMA, Gemma, and GPT show more linguistically meaningful and
coherent tokens. Although demonstrated on Turkish, the approach is
language-independent and adaptable to other languages, offering a practical
path toward more interpretable and effective multilingual NLP systems.

Method: 构建了由60名特级教师标注的ZPD-SCA基准，测试LLM在零样本和上下文学习场景下对中文阅读理解材料难度与学生认知能力匹配度的评估能力。

Result: 零样本学习中模型表现差（Qwen-max和GLM甚至低于随机猜测），上下文学习后性能显著提升（部分模型准确率翻倍），但仍存在系统性偏差和不同体裁间的性能差异。

Conclusion: LLM具备评估阅读难度的新兴能力，但在教育对齐判断方面仍有局限，ZPD-SCA基准可为认知对齐教育应用的LLM评估和改进提供基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in educational
applications, yet their capacity to accurately assess the cognitive alignment
of reading materials with students' developmental stages remains insufficiently
explored. This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational
principle of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need
to match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite
the importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive
studies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension
difficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of
Chinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel
benchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading
comprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade
teachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers
nationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot
learning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of
random guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance
improves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy
of their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging
abilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in
their current training for educationally aligned judgment. Notably, even the
best-performing models display systematic directional biases, suggesting
difficulties in accurately aligning material difficulty with SCA. Furthermore,
significant variations in model performance across different genres underscore
the complexity of task. We envision that ZPD-SCA can provide a foundation for
evaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications.

Conclusion: RLS方法能够有效理解自然语言论证的逻辑结构，支持多种推理形式，包括任意深度推理、实时错误修正和交互式讨论。

Abstract: Convincing someone of the truth value of a premise requires understanding and
articulating the core logical structure of the argument which proves or
disproves the premise. Understanding the logical structure of an argument
refers to understanding the underlying "reasons" which make up the proof or
disproof of the premise - as a function of the "logical atoms" in the argument.
While it has been shown that transformers can "chain" rules to derive simple
arguments, the challenge of articulating the "reasons" remains. Not only do
current approaches to chaining rules suffer in terms of their interpretability,
they are also quite constrained in their ability to accommodate extensions to
theoretically equivalent reasoning tasks - a model trained to chain rules
cannot support abduction or identify contradictions. In this work we suggest
addressing these shortcomings by identifying an intermediate representation
(which we call the Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS) of the
argument) that possesses an understanding of the logical structure of a natural
language argument - the logical atoms in the argument and the rules
incorporating them. Given the logical structure, reasoning is deterministic and
easy to compute. Therefore, our approach supports all forms of reasoning that
depend on the logical structure of the natural language argument, including
arbitrary depths of reasoning, on-the-fly mistake rectification and interactive
discussion with respect to an argument. We show that we can identify and
extract the logical structure of natural language arguments in three popular
reasoning datasets with high accuracies, thus supporting explanation generation
and extending the reasoning capabilities significantly.

Conclusion: LMTransplant通过充分利用LLMs的嵌入知识，能够生成更多样化和创造性的内容级变体，同时保留原始文本的核心属性。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional
methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing,
which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large
language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge
emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs
remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper,
we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs.
The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed
text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant
based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more
diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge
embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We
evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its
superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover,
LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data
grows.

Abstract: Traditional protocol fuzzing techniques, such as those employed by AFL-based
systems, often lack effectiveness due to a limited semantic understanding of
complex protocol grammars and rigid seed mutation strategies. Recent works,
such as ChatAFL, have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide protocol
fuzzing and address these limitations, pushing protocol fuzzers to wider
exploration of the protocol state space. But ChatAFL still faces issues like
unreliable output, LLM hallucinations, and assumptions of LLM knowledge about
protocol specifications. This paper introduces MultiFuzz, a novel dense
retrieval-based multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations by
integrating semantic-aware context retrieval, specialized agents, and
structured tool-assisted reasoning. MultiFuzz utilizes agentic chunks of
protocol documentation (RFC Documents) to build embeddings in a vector database
for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling agents to
generate more reliable and structured outputs, enhancing the fuzzer in mutating
protocol messages with enhanced state coverage and adherence to syntactic
constraints. The framework decomposes the fuzzing process into modular groups
of agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically
adapt fuzzing strategies based on the retrieved contextual knowledge.
Experimental evaluations on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) demonstrate
that MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper
protocol states and transitions over state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers such as
NSFuzz, AFLNet, and ChatAFL. By combining dense retrieval, agentic
coordination, and language model reasoning, MultiFuzz establishes a new
paradigm in autonomous protocol fuzzing, offering a scalable and extensible
foundation for future research in intelligent agentic-based fuzzing systems.

neural underpinnings of this expertise remain largely unexplored. This paper
presents findings from a cross-sectional pilot fMRI study investigating

experts and intermediate prompt engineers. Our results reveal distinct neural
signatures associated with higher prompt engineering literacy, including
increased functional connectivity in brain regions such as the left middle

dynamics in key cognitive networks. These findings offer initial insights into
the neurobiological basis of prompt engineering proficiency. We discuss the
implications of these neurocognitive markers in Natural Language Processing

LLMs can inform the design of more intuitive human-AI interfaces, contribute to
cognitive models of LLM interaction, and potentially guide the development of

Abstract: Visual Storytelling is a challenging multimodal task between Vision &
Language, where the purpose is to generate a story for a stream of images. Its
difficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image
sequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance
between these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image
Captioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant
studies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for
obtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are
transformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our
multifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling
under a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced
stories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach
accelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and
reproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named
ideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle
model, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个联合多任务模型用于UniDive 2025形态句法分析共享任务，使用共享XLM-RoBERTa编码器和三个专门解码器，在九种语言上取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多语言形态句法分析中同时预测形态和句法分析的问题，特别是在遵循新的UD标注方案的情况下，需要开发能够处理多种语言类型的统一模型。

Method: 使用共享的XLM-RoBERTa编码器，配合三个专门解码器：内容词识别、依存句法分析和形态句法特征预测，形成一个联合多任务学习框架。

Result: 在九种类型学多样语言上取得最佳性能：平均MSLAS 78.7%、LAS 80.1%、Feats F1 90.3%。消融研究表明黄金分词和内容词识别对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言形态句法分析任务中表现优异，但在核心语法格（特别是Nom-Acc）和跨语言名词特征处理方面仍存在挑战。

Abstract: We present a joint multitask model for the UniDive 2025 Morpho-Syntactic
Parsing shared task, where systems predict both morphological and syntactic
analyses following novel UD annotation scheme. Our system uses a shared
XLM-RoBERTa encoder with three specialized decoders for content word
identification, dependency parsing, and morphosyntactic feature prediction. Our
model achieves the best overall performance on the shared task's leaderboard
covering nine typologically diverse languages, with an average MSLAS score of
78.7 percent, LAS of 80.1 percent, and Feats F1 of 90.3 percent. Our ablation
studies show that matching the task's gold tokenization and content word
identification are crucial to model performance. Error analysis reveals that
our model struggles with core grammatical cases (particularly Nom-Acc) and
nominal features across languages.

Conclusion: 该方法为文学情感分析提供了更有效的连续评分方案，特别适合处理文学文本的复杂情感表达

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis is widely used to quantify sentiment in text, but its
application to literary texts poses unique challenges due to figurative
language, stylistic ambiguity, as well as sentiment evocation strategies.
Traditional dictionary-based tools often underperform, especially for
low-resource languages, and transformer models, while promising, typically
output coarse categorical labels that limit fine-grained analysis. We introduce
a novel continuous sentiment scoring method based on concept vector projection,
trained on multilingual literary data, which more effectively captures nuanced
sentiment expressions across genres, languages, and historical periods. Our
approach outperforms existing tools on English and Danish texts, producing
sentiment scores whose distribution closely matches human ratings, enabling
more accurate analysis and sentiment arc modeling in literature.

Abstract: Based on comparable English-Chinese news corpora annotated by Large Language
Model (LLM), this paper attempts to explore the differences in constituent
order of English-Chinese news from the perspective of functional chunks with
adverbial roles, and analyze their typical positional preferences and
distribution patterns. It is found that: (1) English news prefers linear
narrative of core information first, and functional chunks are mostly
post-positioned, while Chinese news prefers overall presentation mode of
background first, and functional chunks are often pre-positioned; (2) In SVO
structure, both English and Chinese news show differences in the distribution
of functional chunks, but the tendency of Chinese pre-positioning is more
significant, while that of English post-positioning is relatively mild; (3)
When function blocks are co-occurring, both English and Chinese news show high
flexibility, and the order adjustment is driven by information and pragmatic
purposes. The study reveals that word order has both systematic preference and
dynamic adaptability, providing new empirical support for contrastive study of
English-Chinese information structure.

Motivation: 解决手语生成中由于手语者形态和风格变化导致的高类内变异性问题，提高模型对这类变化的鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 使用四元数空间编码骨骼旋转并采用测地损失；2) 引入基于语义相似性的对比损失来结构化解码器嵌入。

Conclusion: 将骨骼结构建模和语义引导的对比目标整合到基于Transformer的手语生成模型训练中具有显著益处。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in neural sign language production (SLP) lies in
the high intra-class variability of signs, arising from signer morphology and
stylistic variety in the training data. To improve robustness to such
variations, we propose two enhancements to the standard Progressive
Transformers (PT) architecture (Saunders et al., 2020). First, we encode poses
using bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to
improve the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we
introduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic
similarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,
aiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey
relevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss
alone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT
baseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves
a 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error. These results point to the benefit of
incorporating skeletal structure modeling and semantically guided contrastive
objectives on sign pose representations into the training of Transformer-based
SLP models.

Abstract: The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become
increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road
deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined
threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose
diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a
framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning
novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.
Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario
Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving
knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is
both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then
specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,
Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat
introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to
identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are
designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and
create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe
collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our
ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different
simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios
improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through
real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated
scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a
critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

Conclusion: UST-SSM成功将状态空间模型扩展到点云视频处理，解决了时空无序性问题，为4D点云分析提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of
lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing
subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models
(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,
the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional
modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence
through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose
the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the
latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce
Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points
into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby
enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally
distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion
details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates
spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction
within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances
fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and
expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D,
and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using
data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data
usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most
institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other
hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific
data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is
transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly
valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the
development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new
model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and
preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a
shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by
their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation
strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating
knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.
By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit
teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.
Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently
supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision
tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance
segmentation.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have gained impressive performance due to
their outstanding capability in various understanding tasks. However, these
models still suffer from some fundamental limitations related to robustness and
generalization due to the alignment and correlation between visual and textual
features. In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient learning mechanism
for improving the robust alignment between visual and textual modalities by
solving shuffling problems. In particular, the proposed approach can improve
reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment by
introducing two new tasks: reconstructing the image order and the text order
into the LMM's pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In addition, we propose a
new directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling
the capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we
introduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual
understanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on
academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

Method: 提出对比条件推理（CCI）框架，显式建模图像嵌入、类别标签和理由之间的概率关系，无需训练即可实现更有效的理由条件化

Result: 在多理由可解释物体识别基准上取得最先进结果，包括强大的零样本性能，在分类准确性和理由质量方面都设立了新标准

Conclusion: 这项工作与基准一起为评估未来可解释物体识别模型提供了更完整的框架

Abstract: Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP
involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that
justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on
prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text
encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally,
prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales
that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In
this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition
benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple
ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more
comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of
previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)
framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image
embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,
our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict
accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong
zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy
and rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more
complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object
recognition. The code will be made available online.

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play
a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated
by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs,

ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps

Motivation: 测试时适应方法需要在适应领域变化和保持任务相关知识之间取得平衡，当前方法在适应领域偏移时容易导致任务相关知识的遗忘。

Method: 提出FOCUS方法，使用训练好的轻量级Y形频率预测网络(Y-FPN)从噪声图像中分离高低频信息，结合FrequencyMix数据增强方法，在扩散驱动的去噪过程中通过频率先验条件化来保持语义信息。

Conclusion: FOCUS通过频率调节机制有效解决了测试时适应中的知识保持问题，既能提升独立性能，又能作为现有方法的补充，通过伪标签提供额外监督。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However,
balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain
shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to
domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this
problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within
a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially
adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during
diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for
dense prediction.
  FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network
(Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images.
This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in
a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data
augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands,
which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and
monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets,
achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving
standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods
since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional
supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo
labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates
catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

Abstract: We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built
upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control
the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional
fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution
drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in
compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the
pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual
concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture
and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the
control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector
that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their
propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector
employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines
MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control
feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control
signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably
against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as
well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness,
and temporal consistency. The codes and checkpoints are publicly available at

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure
product quality and identify process deviations. Statistical and data-driven
approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their
adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive
annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions.
Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide
promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This
paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel
framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of
foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD
addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data
sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the
anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is
specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process
knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user
inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain
experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science
expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across
three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation
study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.
Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly
detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance,
particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely
through semantic instructions.

Conclusion: 提出的对抗框架能有效缓解PFMs中的医院偏差，为临床部署提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
whole-slide image (WSI) diagnosis. However, pathology images from different
hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing
styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features,
posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source
characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying
domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple
models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent
hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the
encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier
connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns
task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on
multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach
substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving
disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen
hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature
space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating
hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects into editable programs is pivotal for applications
like reverse engineering and shape editing. However, existing methods often
rely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets,
restricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To
address these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that

scripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs
capable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we
construct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each
object is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a
multimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into
executable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior
performance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates
intuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code
modifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these
contributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for

Abstract: Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding
and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and
robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their
ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we
introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly
optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We
propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and
segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT
rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available
3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS
achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg
benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to

Abstract: We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method
fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative
model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image
generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly
when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and
cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.
Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or
finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally
specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address
this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic
understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.
Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require
a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In
comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to
control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of
parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This
integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural
authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining
compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and
ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese
and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual
realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

Conclusion: SATURN有效地将结构意识与最先进的自回归保真度相结合，展示了在保持高质量生成的同时提升结构理解能力的潜力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but
often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by
complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous
graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion
pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed

frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only
the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable models that
make predictions based on human-understandable visual cues, referred to as
concepts. As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is
demanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine
the concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail
to localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated
regions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework,
coined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich
information from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure
accurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one
prototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature
of that concept. These prototypes are learned by encouraging them to encode
similar local regions, leveraging foundation models to assure the relevance of
each prototype to its associated concept. Then we use the prototypes to
facilitate the learning process of identifying the proper local region from
which each concept should be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that
LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in the images and exhibits
improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology (CPath) pose a major
computational challenge due to their gigapixel scale, often requiring the
processing of tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per
slide. This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and
training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most
significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose
WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain
vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by
selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first
computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific
textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves
fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a
small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly
eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding
high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual
embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving
diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch
processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.

Method: 提出SMTrack框架，包含：1) Asa-NWDLoss损失函数，根据训练批次中平均目标大小动态调整归一化因子，提升对小目标的检测灵敏度；2) TrackTrack身份模块，在关联阶段保持目标轨迹的一致性和鲁棒性。

Result: 在BEE24、MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack数据集上的广泛评估表明，SMTrack达到了与领先的ANN-based MOT方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了SNN在复杂场景中鲁棒准确跟踪的发展，证明了直接训练的SNN在RGB视频多目标跟踪任务中的可行性。

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential
for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains
largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based
tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional
RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex
temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To
address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN
framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack
introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss
(Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying
object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average
object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the
normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the
association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain
robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24,
MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with
leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking
in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,
and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in
vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP
model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues
found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages
CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on
a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection
symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel
prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which
aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate
the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym
outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection
datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations
verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant
decoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available at

Conclusion: 需要将增强策略与下游不确定性量化协同设计，以构建真正值得信赖的医疗影像AI系统。

Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as
diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While
models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of
robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a
distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical
guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training
practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not
well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different
data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for
DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures --
ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under
five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms,
CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal
metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup
and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable
and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can
negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to
co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in
mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

Abstract: Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for
autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving
primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support
multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and
semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous
driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different
modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not
leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this
problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video
generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified
diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and
modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to
encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion
model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is
capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified
framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving
dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view
urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer

across diverse domains and challenges in modeling complex interaction

generalizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony,
the framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that
explicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM)

establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and

Conclusion: 该方法通过解耦通用和个性化变形，结合对比损失和粗到细细化，显著提升了少样本3D说话头合成的性能。

Abstract: A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a
long-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity
from scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting
general features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio
contains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically
struggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face
when trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking
head image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that
constructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial
Motion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute
deformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and
personalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss
function during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,
we integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating
blurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization
with limited training data. Our code will be provided upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of video generation, demand for customized video
editing is surging, where subject swapping constitutes a key component yet
remains under-explored. Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in
narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or
rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that
compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided,
subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for
customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject
fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated
condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an
adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales
and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and
its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction
and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated
by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced
DreamSwapV-Benchmark.

Abstract: The ability to predict collision-free future trajectories from egocentric
observations is crucial in applications such as humanoid robotics, VR / AR, and
assistive navigation. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of
predicting a sequence of future 6D head poses from an egocentric video. In
particular, we predict both head translations and rotations to learn the active
information-gathering behavior expressed through head-turning events. To solve
this task, we propose a framework that reasons over temporally aggregated 3D
latent features, which models the geometric and semantic constraints for both
the static and dynamic parts of the environment. Motivated by the lack of
training data in this space, we further contribute a data collection pipeline
using the Project Aria glasses, and present a dataset collected through this
approach. Our dataset, dubbed Aria Navigation Dataset (AND), consists of 4
hours of recording of users navigating in real-world scenarios. It includes
diverse situations and navigation behaviors, providing a valuable resource for
learning real-world egocentric navigation policies. Extensive experiments show
that our model learns human-like navigation behaviors such as waiting / slowing
down, rerouting, and looking around for traffic while generalizing to unseen

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion
generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation
(CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code
representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained
motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method
that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion
features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the
interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing
subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on
the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance
(FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510.
Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes

underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining

Abstract: The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high
accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing
methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval
performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the
fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To
alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained
features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve
performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine
objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,
including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for
training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which
is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in
captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the
original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval
performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates
a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better
retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental
results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant
performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained immense interest for their generative
capabilities, specifically the high quality and diversity of the synthesized
data. However, examples of their applications in 3D medical imaging are still
scarce, especially in cardiology. Generating diverse realistic cardiac
anatomies is crucial for applications such as in silico trials,
electromechanical computer simulations, or data augmentations for machine
learning models. In this work, we investigate the application of Latent
Diffusion Models (LDMs) for generating 3D meshes of human cardiac anatomies. To
this end, we propose a novel LDM architecture -- MeshLDM. We apply the proposed
model on a dataset of 3D meshes of left ventricular cardiac anatomies from
patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate its performance in terms
of both qualitative and quantitative clinical and 3D mesh reconstruction
metrics. The proposed MeshLDM successfully captures characteristics of the
cardiac shapes at end-diastolic (relaxation) and end-systolic (contraction)
cardiac phases, generating meshes with a 2.4% difference in population mean
compared to the gold standard.

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-precision semantic segmentation method based on an
improved TransUNet architecture to address the challenges of complex lesion
structures, blurred boundaries, and significant scale variations in skin lesion
images. The method integrates a transformer module into the traditional
encoder-decoder framework to model global semantic information, while retaining
a convolutional branch to preserve local texture and edge features. This
enhances the model's ability to perceive fine-grained structures. A
boundary-guided attention mechanism and multi-scale upsampling path are also
designed to improve lesion boundary localization and segmentation consistency.
To verify the effectiveness of the approach, a series of experiments were
conducted, including comparative studies, hyperparameter sensitivity analysis,
data augmentation effects, input resolution variation, and training data split
ratio tests. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms
existing representative methods in mIoU, mDice, and mAcc, demonstrating
stronger lesion recognition accuracy and robustness. In particular, the model
achieves better boundary reconstruction and structural recovery in complex
scenarios, making it well-suited for the key demands of automated segmentation
tasks in skin lesion analysis.

Conclusion: 该框架填补了H&E与多重成像之间的空白，为回顾性研究和现有H&E图像库的大规模分析提供了可能

Abstract: Multiplex imaging is revolutionizing pathology by enabling the simultaneous
visualization of multiple biomarkers within tissue samples, providing
molecular-level insights that traditional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
cannot provide. However, the complexity and cost of multiplex data acquisition
have hindered its widespread adoption. Additionally, most existing large
repositories of H&E images lack corresponding multiplex images, limiting
opportunities for multimodal analysis. To address these challenges, we leverage
recent advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs), which excel at modeling
complex data distributions utilizing their powerful priors for fine-tuning to a
target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for virtual
multiplex staining that utilizes pretrained LDM parameters to generate
multiplex images from H&E images using a conditional diffusion model. Our
approach enables marker-by-marker generation by conditioning the diffusion
model on each marker, while sharing the same architecture across all markers.
To tackle the challenge of varying pixel value distributions across different
marker stains and to improve inference speed, we fine-tune the model for
single-step sampling, enhancing both color contrast fidelity and inference
efficiency through pixel-level loss functions. We validate our framework on two
publicly available datasets, notably demonstrating its effectiveness in
generating up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, a
substantial increase over the 2-3 marker types achieved in previous approaches.
This validation highlights the potential of our framework, pioneering virtual
multiplex staining. Finally, this paper bridges the gap between H&E and
multiplex imaging, potentially enabling retrospective studies and large-scale
analyses of existing H&E image repositories.

Conclusion: MUSE推进了可控图像合成的前沿，为多主体组合合成提供了有效的统一框架。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts.
However, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial
control remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of
layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful
reconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified
regions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately
improved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to
simultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity
preservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a
unified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to
seamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through
explicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables
bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual
descriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive
two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable
sub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial
accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the
frontier of controllable image synthesis. Our code and model are available at

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced
novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel
viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile,
diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on
text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder
accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce
GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in
under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models
into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene
details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our
customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to
adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact
types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair
for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation
strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions.
Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer
achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific
fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience
to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 联邦学习不仅能保护隐私，还能显著增强跨用户泛化能力，是异构工业环境中可扩展、隐私感知的人体动作识别的实用解决方案。

Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of
worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine
collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers
robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing
approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in
privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated
learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of
eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five
participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal
backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under
four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated
averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the
global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4
percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain.
On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by
+52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that
FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user
generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable,
privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.

Conclusion: DEC是处理尺度变化的有效方法，能够显著提升现有模型的性能和尺度一致性

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the
same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further
affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the
objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same
image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium
canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can
be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted
to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet
benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency
across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by
the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel
paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an
innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to
peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model
relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our
approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or
regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the
form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant
improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several
benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in
scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The
experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential
of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification
tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach
to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based
learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data.
In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely
normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the
regular GCN.

Conclusion: ICR损失可轻松集成到现有IoU损失中，有效提升小目标检测性能，特别适用于具有空间依赖关系的多目标检测场景

Abstract: In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union
(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets
during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the
gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update
of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more
because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class
relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not
sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact
that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate
is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's
bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the
learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's
and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship
at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger
objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,
we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:
(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse
real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class
relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.
We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing
IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the
standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%
in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without
any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

Abstract: Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at
synthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill
emotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome
two challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship
related to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this
relationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper,
we propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face
generation task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies
to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into
combinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA)
representation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens.
Finally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global
distribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further
predict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct
experiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned
on multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic
surgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations
is significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by
their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing
strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods
have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation
between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot
process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy
points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on
registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread
applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based
coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated
correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud
transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network
and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second
stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point
movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood
precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric
structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous
global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated
recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose
an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical
organs.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered
datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization
results. The code is available at https://github.com/Runshi-Zhang/TCFNet.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals continuously
while addressing spectral bias through activation functions (AFs). Previous
approaches mitigate this bias by employing complex AFs, which often incur
significant hardware overhead. To tackle this challenge, we introduce QuadINR,
a hardware-efficient INR that utilizes piecewise quadratic AFs to achieve
superior performance with dramatic reductions in hardware consumption. The
quadratic functions encompass rich harmonic content in their Fourier series,
delivering enhanced expressivity for high-frequency signals, as verified
through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis. We develop a unified $N$-stage
pipeline framework that facilitates efficient hardware implementation of
various AFs in INRs. We demonstrate FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform
and an ASIC implementation in a 28nm process. Experiments across images and
videos show that QuadINR achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over prior
work, with an area of only 1914$\mu$m$^2$ and a dynamic power of 6.14mW,
reducing resource and power consumption by up to 97\% and improving latency by

Conclusion: 为下一代稳健且分辨率感知的ST建模奠定了基础，提供了高效准确的大规模ST推断解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal AI have demonstrated promising potential for
generating the currently expensive spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly
from routine histology images, offering a means to reduce the high cost and
time-intensive nature of ST data acquisition. However, the increasing
resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um
or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.
Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient
and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low
expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and
evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel
histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution
ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net
employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene
expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel
representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a
super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output
channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also
better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To
enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce
SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for
high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent
framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled
solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions
lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and
resolution-aware. The source code has been made publicly available at

Conclusion: MoCHA-former通过创新的解耦和自适应机制，有效解决了视频去摩尔纹的多重挑战，无需显式对齐模块即可保持时序一致性

Abstract: Recent advances in portable imaging have made camera-based screen capture
ubiquitous. Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter
array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely
degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have
been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer
from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a
frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)
channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across
frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive
Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled
Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing
(STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)
and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features
using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD
introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture
large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel
dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs
implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze
moir\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and
evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former
consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large
amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen
data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing
low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where
intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data
variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit
each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the
redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs
of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce
an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment
process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in
documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan
military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

Abstract: Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally
limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve
high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost
is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction
efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view
inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural
artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties,
leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose
GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we
establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with
split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models.
Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance
sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via
differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular
details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures
anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art

relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique
challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense
supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit
for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse
datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to
increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively
is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively
expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and
existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation
semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for
controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By
conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion),
HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial
semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of
patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time
consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple
slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing
methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the
benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and
highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation. Code is available at

Abstract: Fire outbreaks pose critical threats to human life and infrastructure,
necessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion
precursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal
dynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and
environmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To
address these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor
arrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature
representations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase
Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke
detection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via
optical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is
performed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set
fractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The
resulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a
Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke
regions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows
Transformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head
and trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes
smoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to
estimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple
evaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable

Abstract: We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to
handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for
extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches
like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose
estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods
relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to
unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these
challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly
from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep
learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and
generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which
enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a
probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and
(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for
stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,
inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,
we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:
(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that
are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and
overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from

Motivation: 解决车牌识别中低分辨率、运动模糊和眩光等问题，现有生成模型依赖预训练先验知识，容易产生伪影和失真

Method: 使用先进光流估计器进行帧对齐，设计算法检测和校正错误光流估计，利用时空一致性聚合多帧信息

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement,
crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam
images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make
accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on
pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently
introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose
a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,
MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and
aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To
achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow
estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and
correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal
consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances
both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential
content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR
(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of
low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth
images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,
MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an
accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and
the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of
ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms
significantly contribute to these improvements.

Motivation: 解决传统学习型医学图像配准方法需要大量训练数据的问题，提高临床应用的可行性

Method: 使用预训练的DINOv3编码器提取特征，在测试时通过优化特征空间中的变形场来实现图像配准，无需额外训练

Result: 在腹部MR-CT配准中达到最佳Dice分数0.790，最低HD95距离4.9±5.0，最低SDLogJ 0.08±0.02；在ACDC心脏MRI中Dice分数0.769，SDLogJ 0.11，HD95 4.8

Conclusion: 在紧凑的基础特征空间中进行测试时优化为临床图像配准提供了实用且通用的解决方案，无需额外训练

Abstract: Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based
methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains
clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free
pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of
the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,
the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it
attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard
deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it
improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked
gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a
compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general
solution for clinical registration without additional training.

Conclusion: Tinker代表了向真正可扩展、零样本3D编辑迈出的关键一步，通过重新利用预训练扩散模型的潜在3D感知能力实现了突破

Abstract: We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that
operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene
finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene
optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of
consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent
edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing
pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive
research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing
dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this
dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent
edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel
components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven
edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video
synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform
high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse
inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier
to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that
Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

Method: 提出Multi-Skeleton Contrastive Learning (MS-CLR)框架，从同一动作序列中提取多种骨架表示，通过对比学习对齐不同骨架表示之间的姿态表示。改进ST-GCN架构以处理不同关节布局和尺度的骨架数据。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60和120数据集上的实验表明，MS-CLR相比单一骨架对比学习方法性能持续提升，多骨架集成方法在两个数据集上都达到了新的state-of-the-art结果。

Conclusion: 多骨架对比学习能够有效学习结构不变性并捕捉多样化的解剖线索，产生更具表达力和泛化能力的特征表示。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in skeleton-based
action recognition for its ability to learn robust representations from
unlabeled data. However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention,
which limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint
structures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive
Learning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose
representations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same
sequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture
diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable
features. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons
with varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.
Experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR
consistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive
learning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance,
setting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

plausible and can be either impactful or benign to the task at hand. The
definition aims at facilitating the evaluation of medical devices that suffer
from hallucinations across product areas. Using examples from imaging and
non-imaging applications, we explore how the proposed definition relates to

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable achievements in perceptual image
restoration (IR), creating an urgent demand for accurate image quality
assessment (IQA), which is essential for both performance comparison and
algorithm optimization. Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit
inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained
quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we
contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset
for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images
across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores,
FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences.
Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA
metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA
evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these
findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for
image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and
fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate
that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D human bodies from sparse views has been an appealing topic,
which is crucial to broader the related applications. In this paper, we propose
a quite challenging but valuable task to reconstruct the human body from only
two images, i.e., the front and back view, which can largely lower the barrier
for users to create their own 3D digital humans. The main challenges lie in the
difficulty of building 3D consistency and recovering missing information from
the highly sparse input. We redesign a geometry reconstruction model based on
foundation reconstruction models to predict consistent point clouds even input
images have scarce overlaps with extensive human data training. Furthermore, an
enhancement algorithm is applied to supplement the missing color information,
and then the complete human point clouds with colors can be obtained, which are
directly transformed into 3D Gaussians for better rendering quality.
Experiments show that our method can reconstruct the entire human in 190 ms on
a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, with two images at a resolution of 1024x1024,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the THuman2.0 and cross-domain
datasets. Additionally, our method can complete human reconstruction even with
images captured by low-cost mobile devices, reducing the requirements for data
collection. Demos and code are available at

Abstract: Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular
level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research.
However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled
personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive,
labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep
learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image
analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular
morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated
morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this
gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells
treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution
for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future
studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN,
which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses
a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model
integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to
enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation
are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size
of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely
solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the
intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and
reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose
HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose
estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud
representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples
object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately
encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a
contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on
our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds
from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational
differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose
estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and
translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose
successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25
benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only
state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as

Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features

accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models
with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty,
alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a
denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order
correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability
especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP

cost-efficient and high-accuracy agricultural inventory and analysis in an
automated way. Lots of studies that aim at providing an inventory of the level
of each agricultural parcel have generated many methods for Agricultural Parcel
and Boundary Delineation (APBD). This review covers APBD methods for detecting
and delineating agricultural parcels and systematically reviews the past and
present of APBD-related research applied to remote sensing images. With the
goal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing APBD efforts, we conduct a
comprehensive review of recent APBD papers to build a meta-data analysis,
including the algorithm, the study site, the crop type, the sensor type, the
evaluation method, etc. We categorize the methods into three classes: (1)
traditional image processing methods (including pixel-based, edge-based and
region-based); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest,
decision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep
learning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss
deep learning-based methods like semantic segmentation-based, object
detection-based and Transformer-based methods. In addition, we discuss five
APBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing
data, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task
learning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among
different algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review
proposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and
potential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help
researchers who involved in APBD domain to keep track of its development and
tendency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAW图像具有传感器和光照特定的特性，使得为深度学习捕获数据集具有挑战性。需要为每个传感器和广泛光照范围捕获场景，因此需要开发光照增强和传感器间映射方法来减轻数据捕获负担。

Method: 使用定制化的可调光谱光照箱捕获多个场景，构建包含390种光照、4个相机和18个场景的数据集。提出轻量级神经网络方法进行光照和传感器映射。

Result: 提出的方法在竞争方法中表现优异，并在下游任务（神经ISP训练）中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决RAW图像处理中的光照和传感器依赖问题提供了有效的数据集和方法，有助于减少深度学习应用中的数据捕获需求。

Abstract: RAW images are unprocessed camera sensor output with sensor-specific RGB
values based on the sensor's color filter spectral sensitivities. RAW images
also incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral
properties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature
of RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning
methods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range
of illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and
the ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the
burden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the
first-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide
range of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable
illumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our
illumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras,
and 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network
approach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing
methods. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the downstream task of
training a neural ISP. Link to project page:

Motivation: 解决单纯依赖AIS数据进行船舶定位的局限性，包括设备可靠性、数据操纵和传输延迟等问题，通过视觉-AIS数据融合实现自动化的6D姿态标注。

Method: 使用YOLOX-X目标检测网络定位图像中的船舶，结合AIS消息数据，采用PnP（Perspective-n-Point）方法将AIS数据与图像坐标对齐，生成3D边界框表示6D姿态。

Result: PnP方法相比单应性变换显著降低了投影误差，YOLOX-X模型在相关船舶类别上达到0.80的mAP（IoU=0.5），成功创建了包含3753张图像的BONK-pose数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法能够无需人工标注自动创建6D姿态估计数据集，为船舶姿态估计网络的训练和评估提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation
dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic
Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the
limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues
like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By
combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object
detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D
bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and
rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to
locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods
(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image
coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to
homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold
of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows
the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.
Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a
publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box
annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This
dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In
addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for
ship detection from the same scene.

Motivation: 解决高速运动物体在传统相机帧率限制和运动模糊下的6-DoF位姿跟踪难题，利用事件相机的高时间分辨率和RGB相机的丰富视觉信息优势互补

Method: 使用事件相机光学流算法测量物体运动，实现6-DoF速度跟踪器，再与低频RGB全局位姿估计器集成进行位姿跟踪

Result: 在合成和真实数据上验证了方法的有效性，特别是在高速运动场景中表现优异

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了事件相机和RGB相机的优势，为高速运动物体的6-DoF位姿跟踪提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in
real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It
becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate
limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are
characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,
that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB
cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the
challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we
propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object
pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the
core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an
event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement
an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF
velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the
method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm
is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating
its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

Motivation: 现有光照编辑方法无法同时提供定制化的光照控制并保持内容完整性，特别是在将复杂光照效果从参考图像迁移到目标图像时效果不佳

Method: 使用两个微调的扩散模型进行生成式解耦，分离图像内容和光照效果，创建百万级的三元组数据集，然后使用IC-Light作为生成模型进行训练

Result: TransLight成功实现了跨不同图像的光照效果迁移，提供了比现有技术更定制化的光照控制

Conclusion: 该方法为光照协调和编辑研究开辟了新方向，实现了高度灵活的光照控制

Abstract: Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide
customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes
them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially
in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference
image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose
TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom
transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image
is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in
the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are
highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first
present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used
to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly
curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ
IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,
injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.
The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of
diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from
reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with
highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight
as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate
images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing
techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination
harmonization and editing.

Conclusion: EventSSEG方法有效利用了事件相机的优势，解决了标注数据稀缺问题，为自动驾驶道路分割提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Road segmentation is pivotal for autonomous vehicles, yet achieving low
latency and low compute solutions using frame based cameras remains a
challenge. Event cameras offer a promising alternative. To leverage their low
power sensing, we introduce EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation that uses
event only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism. Event only
computing poses a challenge in transferring pretrained weights from the
conventional camera domain, requiring abundant labeled data, which is scarce.
To overcome this, EventSSEG employs event-based self supervised learning,
eliminating the need for extensive labeled data. Experiments on DSEC-Semantic
and DDD17 show that EventSSEG achieves state of the art performance with
minimal labeled events. This approach maximizes event cameras capabilities and
addresses the lack of labeled events.

Conclusion: 统一铰接表示在可扩展物理建模中具有巨大潜力，适用于机器人仿真和人机交互建模等下游任务。

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of
interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry
and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then
estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates
the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects
with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation
that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This
formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports
articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior
approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.
To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a
new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each
with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry
reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We
further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic
simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of
unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.

Conclusion: ACCS方法识别出与下游任务或模型无关的可重用信息通道集，使其高度适用于各种基于EEG的应用。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have gained widespread adoption in
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to their non-invasive,
low-cost, and relatively simple acquisition process. The demand for higher
spatial resolution, particularly in clinical settings, has led to the
development of high-density electrode arrays. However, increasing the number of
channels introduces challenges such as cross-channel interference and
computational overhead. To address these issues, modern BCI systems often
employ channel selection algorithms. Existing methods, however, are typically
task-specific and require re-optimization for each new application. This work
proposes a task-agnostic channel selection method, Activity Coefficient-based
Channel Selection (ACCS), which uses a novel metric called the Channel Activity
Coefficient (CAC) to quantify channel utility based on activity levels. By
selecting the top 16 channels ranked by CAC, ACCS achieves up to 34.97%
improvement in multi-class classification accuracy. Unlike traditional
approaches, ACCS identifies a reusable set of informative channels independent
of the downstream task or model, making it highly adaptable for diverse
EEG-based applications.

Abstract: With the reduced hardware costs of omnidirectional cameras and the
proliferation of various extended reality applications, more and more
$360^\circ$ videos are being captured. To fully unleash their potential,
advanced video analytics is expected to extract actionable insights and
situational knowledge without blind spots from the videos. In this paper, we

significant computation and network resource challenges of analyzing
$360^\circ$ videos. Motivated by our measurement insights into $360^\circ$
videos, OmniSense introduces a lightweight spherical region of interest (SRoI)
prediction algorithm to prune redundant information in $360^\circ$ frames.
Incorporating the video content and network dynamics, it then smartly scales
vision models to analyze the predicted SRoIs with optimized resource
utilization. We implement a prototype of OmniSense with commodity devices and
evaluate it on diverse real-world collected $360^\circ$ videos. Extensive
evaluation results show that compared to resource-agnostic baselines, it
improves the accuracy by $19.8\%$ -- $114.6\%$ with similar end-to-end

Conclusion: PET-DPC是一种快速、定量准确的PET重建方法，具有改善临床成像工作流程的潜力

Abstract: Deep learning-based reconstruction of positron emission tomography(PET) data
has gained increasing attention in recent years. While these methods achieve
fast reconstruction,concerns remain regarding quantitative accuracy and the
presence of artifacts,stemming from limited model interpretability,data driven
dependence, and overfitting risks.These challenges have hindered clinical
adoption.To address them,we propose a conditional diffusion model with
posterior physical correction (PET-DPC) for PET image reconstruction. An
innovative normalization procedure generates the input Geometric TOF
Probabilistic Image (GTP-image),while physical information is incorporated
during the diffusion sampling process to perform posterior
scatter,attenuation,and random corrections. The model was trained and validated
on 300 brain and 50 whole-body PET datasets,a physical phantom,and 20 simulated
brain datasets. PET-DPC produced reconstructions closely aligned with fully
corrected OSEM images,outperforming end-to-end deep learning models in
quantitative metrics and,in some cases, surpassing traditional iterative
methods. The model also generalized well to out-of-distribution(OOD) data.
Compared to iterative methods,PET-DPC reduced reconstruction time by 50% for
brain scans and 85% for whole-body scans. Ablation studies confirmed the
critical role of posterior correction in implementing scatter and attenuation
corrections,enhancing reconstruction accuracy. Experiments with physical
phantoms further demonstrated PET-DPC's ability to preserve background
uniformity and accurately reproduce tumor-to-background intensity ratios.
Overall,these results highlight PET-DPC as a promising approach for rapid,
quantitatively accurate PET reconstruction,with strong potential to improve
clinical imaging workflows.

Abstract: Inverse rendering aims to reconstruct geometry and reflectance from captured
images. Display-camera imaging systems offer unique advantages for this task:
each pixel can easily function as a programmable point light source, and the
polarized light emitted by LCD displays facilitates diffuse-specular
separation. Despite these benefits, there is currently no public real-world
dataset captured using display-camera systems, unlike other setups such as
light stages. This absence hinders the development and evaluation of
display-based inverse rendering methods. In this paper, we introduce the first
real-world dataset for display-based inverse rendering. To achieve this, we
construct and calibrate an imaging system comprising an LCD display and stereo
polarization cameras. We then capture a diverse set of objects with diverse
geometry and reflectance under one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) display patterns. We
also provide high-quality ground-truth geometry. Our dataset enables the
synthesis of captured images under arbitrary display patterns and different
noise levels. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing
photometric stereo and inverse rendering methods, and provide a simple, yet
effective baseline for display inverse rendering, outperforming
state-of-the-art inverse rendering methods. Code and dataset are available on

the article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions
corresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study
the other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the
speckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean
preservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various
levels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated
via an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of
samples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the
region of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken
slice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations
we observe that the various operators have their own significance while
studying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an
image (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work
well and some do not for some specific features of the image.

Method: 使用临床获取的2533例腹部CT/MRI数据，通过自动化分割提取13个胰腺形态特征，采用GAMLSS回归分析年龄、性别和糖尿病状态对胰腺形态的影响

Result: 调整混杂因素后，13个形态特征中有10个在2型糖尿病患者和对照组之间存在显著差异，MRI和CT测量的胰腺尺寸也存在差异

Abstract: Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting
deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas
size and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals
are to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas
measurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect
potential deviations in type 2 diabetes.
  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged
with abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,
segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological
pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI
measurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.
Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns
stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model
pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2
diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with
type 2 diabetes.
  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13
morphological features were significantly different between patients with type
2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons
corrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas
measurements than CT using our AI-based method.
  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape
of the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and
675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is
smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan
pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a
clinical setting.

Abstract: Volumetric ultrasound has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic
accuracy and clinical decision-making, yet its widespread adoption remains
limited by dependence on specialized hardware and restrictive acquisition
protocols. In this work, we present a novel unsupervised framework for
reconstructing 3D anatomical structures from freehand 2D transvaginal
ultrasound (TVS) sweeps, without requiring external tracking or learned pose
estimators. Our method adapts the principles of Gaussian Splatting to the
domain of ultrasound, introducing a slice-aware, differentiable rasterizer
tailored to the unique physics and geometry of ultrasound imaging. We model
anatomy as a collection of anisotropic 3D Gaussians and optimize their
parameters directly from image-level supervision, leveraging sensorless probe
motion estimation and domain-specific geometric priors. The result is a
compact, flexible, and memory-efficient volumetric representation that captures
anatomical detail with high spatial fidelity. This work demonstrates that
accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D ultrasound images can be achieved through
purely computational means, offering a scalable alternative to conventional 3D
systems and enabling new opportunities for AI-assisted analysis and diagnosis.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在情感评估任务中与人类行为的一致性，为LLMs在需要情感理解的角色或交互中的有效性提供依据。

Method: 使用人类先前评定的情感词汇和图像数据集，让多个流行LLMs进行相同的评分任务，比较LLMs与人类在情感评分上的一致性。

Result: GPT-4o在大多数评分维度上与人类高度相关（r≥0.9），但唤醒度评分一致性较差，幸福感评分一致性最高。LLMs在五类情感框架中的表现优于二维情感组织，且评分比人类更加同质化。

Conclusion: LLMs在情感刺激解释方面与人类存在相似性和差异，这些发现有助于理解生物智能与人工智能在关键行为领域的异同。

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

Method: 开发了MCP-Universe基准测试，包含6个核心领域的11个MCP服务器，并实现了基于执行的评估器（格式评估器、静态评估器和动态评估器）来确保严格评估。

Result: 即使是SOTA模型如GPT-5(43.72%)、Grok-4(33.33%)和Claude-4.0-Sonnet(29.44%)也表现出显著性能限制，特别是在长上下文和未知工具挑战方面。

Conclusion: 该基准测试揭示了LLM在真实MCP环境中的重大挑战，并提供了可扩展的开源评估框架来促进MCP生态系统的创新发展。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.

Motivation: 代码格式化元素主要为人类可读性设计，但对LLM处理可能不必要且增加计算成本。研究旨在验证移除格式化元素是否能提升LLM效率而不影响性能。

Method: 在四种编程语言（Java、Python、C++、C#）上对10个LLM进行大规模填充中间代码补全实验，系统分析格式化元素移除前后的token数量和性能变化。

Result: LLM在格式化与非格式化代码上性能相当，平均输入token减少24.5%，输出token减少可忽略。通过提示和微调可进一步减少36.1%的输出代码长度。

Conclusion: 代码格式化移除是实用的LLM效率优化策略，开发的双向代码转换工具可无缝集成到现有推理流程中，兼顾人类可读性和LLM效率。

Abstract: Source code is usually formatted with elements like indentation and newlines
to improve readability for human developers. However, these visual aids do not
seem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since
the code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these
additional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response
times for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can
reduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played
by formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate
the impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through
large-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four
programming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\#) and ten LLMs-including both
commercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and
performance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that
LLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code,
achieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\% with negligible output
token reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization
strategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both
prompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to
36.1\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate
practical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for
format processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM
inference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain,
where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of
documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in
retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but
also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and
domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the
model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is
most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate
such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce
FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with
multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The
benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms
and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document
type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected
document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning
steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a
quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance.
We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how
targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance.
Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior
in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset
publicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for
the full S&P 500 and beyond.

Conclusion: RealDevWorld提供了可扩展、与人工评估对齐的生产级软件评估方法，能够有效评估LLM生成完整软件应用的能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and code agents in software development are
rapidly evolving from generating isolated code snippets to producing
full-fledged software applications with graphical interfaces, interactive
logic, and dynamic behaviors. However, current benchmarks fall short in
evaluating such production-ready software, as they often rely on static checks
or binary pass/fail scripts, failing to capture the interactive behaviors and
runtime dynamics that define real-world usability - qualities that only emerge
when an application is actively used. This is the blind spot of current
evaluation: you don't know if an app works until you click through it, interact
with it, and observe how it responds. To bridge this gap, we introduce
RealDevWorld, a novel evaluation framework for automated end-to-end assessment
of LLMs' ability to generate production-ready repositories from scratch. It
features two key components: (1) RealDevBench, a diverse collection of 194
open-ended software engineering tasks across multiple domains, incorporating
multimodal elements to reflect real-world complexity; and (2) AppEvalPilot, a
new agent-as-a-judge evaluation system that simulates realistic, GUI-based user
interactions to automatically and holistically assess software functional
correctness, visual fidelity, and runtime behavior. The framework delivers
fine-grained, task-specific diagnostic feedback, supporting nuanced evaluation
beyond simple success/failure judgments. Empirical results show that
RealDevWorld delivers effective, automatic, and human-aligned evaluations,
achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a correlation of 0.85 with expert human
assessments, while significantly reducing the reliance on manual review. This
enables scalable, human-aligned assessment of production-level software
generated by LLMs. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious challenge to the safe deployment of large
language models (LLMs). We introduce CCFC (Core & Core-Full-Core), a
dual-track, prompt-level defense framework designed to mitigate LLMs'
vulnerabilities from prompt injection and structure-aware jailbreak attacks.
CCFC operates by first isolating the semantic core of a user query via few-shot
prompting, and then evaluating the query using two complementary tracks: a
core-only track to ignore adversarial distractions (e.g., toxic suffixes or
prefix injections), and a core-full-core (CFC) track to disrupt the structural
patterns exploited by gradient-based or edit-based attacks. The final response
is selected based on a safety consistency check across both tracks, ensuring
robustness without compromising on response quality. We demonstrate that CCFC
cuts attack success rates by 50-75% versus state-of-the-art defenses against
strong adversaries (e.g., DeepInception, GCG), without sacrificing fidelity on
benign queries. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
prompt-level defenses, offering a practical and effective solution for safer
LLM deployment.

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making
problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily
relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in
addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:
high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation
scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to
heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we
first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more
comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization
modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems
with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel
framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through
chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing
approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical domains, but their
ability to handle specialized neurological reasoning requires systematic
evaluation. We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from

effectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent

questions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty
performance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning
challenges that persisted with RAG enhancement. We validated our approach using
an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases from MedQA. Results confirm
that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized
cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering
promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts.

Motivation: 随着AI代理的广泛部署，事故数量可能增加，现有事故报告流程无法充分理解代理事故，特别是缺乏敏感但有用的信息（如思维链、浏览历史）。

Method: 基于系统安全方法，提出了包含三类因素（系统相关、上下文、认知）的事故分析框架，并确定了有助于澄清事故原因的具体信息类型。

Result: 开发了一个系统化的事故分析框架，为事故报告提供了具体的信息收集建议，包括应包含的信息类型以及开发者和部署者应保留的信息。

Conclusion: 随着AI代理的普及，理解代理事故对于风险管理变得越来越重要，该框架为新兴事故报告流程的开发提供了指导。

Abstract: As AI agents become more widely deployed, we are likely to see an increasing
number of incidents: events involving AI agent use that directly or indirectly
cause harm. For example, agents could be prompt-injected to exfiltrate private
information or make unauthorized purchases. Structured information about such
incidents (e.g., user prompts) can help us understand their causes and prevent
future occurrences. However, existing incident reporting processes are not
sufficient for understanding agent incidents. In particular, such processes are
largely based on publicly available data, which excludes useful, but
potentially sensitive, information such as an agent's chain of thought or
browser history. To inform the development of new, emerging incident reporting
processes, we propose an incident analysis framework for agents. Drawing on
systems safety approaches, our framework proposes three types of factors that
can cause incidents: system-related (e.g., CBRN training data), contextual
(e.g., prompt injections), and cognitive (e.g., misunderstanding a user
request). We also identify specific information that could help clarify which
factors are relevant to a given incident: activity logs, system documentation
and access, and information about the tools an agent uses. We provide
recommendations for 1) what information incident reports should include and 2)
what information developers and deployers should retain and make available to
incident investigators upon request. As we transition to a world with more
agents, understanding agent incidents will become increasingly crucial for
managing risks.

Conclusion: LLM在多智能体协作中展现出潜力但也存在局限性，需要进一步改进架构和基准测试来提升协作能力。

Abstract: The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for
solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the
question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in
multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to
solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor,
prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known
graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying
needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a
suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant
actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new
insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded
multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and
architectural improvements.

they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual

Abstract: Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most
existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified

Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying

introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving
competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo
features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's
foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless
integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry

Conclusion: 不确定性感知、知识约束的LLM方法有望增强城市洪水响应的韧性。

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events
has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban
flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,
threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making
remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among
competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)
requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental
conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies
frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.
Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent
coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates
knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven
optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from
multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We
evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three
representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily
light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and
reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and
system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,
knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban
flood response.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型能力的提升，模型是否能够内省成为一个重要的实践问题。但目前对内省的定义缺乏共识，需要建立更严谨的定义框架来评估AI的内省能力。

Method: 提出新的"厚重内省"定义：任何通过比第三方可用方法更可靠且计算成本相当或更低的过程来获取内部状态信息。通过设计实验让LLM推理其内部温度参数，测试模型的内省能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLM可能表现出轻量级内省的特征，但在更严格的厚重内省定义下无法实现有意义的内省。模型无法可靠地获取比外部观察者更准确的内部状态信息。

Conclusion: 需要更严格的内省定义来准确评估AI模型的内省能力。当前LLM虽然在某些方面表现出内省特征，但尚未达到真正的厚重内省标准。

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.

Motivation: 随着AI工作负载规模和算法复杂度的增加，高维度的硬件设计挑战日益突出。虽然LLM在HDL生成方面表现出色，但在2.5D集成和chiplet设计中面临设计扁平化、验证成本高和参数优化不精确等问题。

Method: 提出MAHL分层框架，包含六个协作代理：分层描述生成、检索增强代码生成、多样化流程验证和多粒度设计空间探索，共同实现AI算法到硬件的映射和PPA优化。

Result: 实验显示MAHL显著提高了简单RTL设计的生成准确性，在最佳情况下将真实chiplet设计的生成准确率（Pass@5）从0提升到0.72，在某些优化目标下达到或超过专家系统CLARIE的PPA结果。

Conclusion: MAHL框架成功解决了LLM驱动chiplet设计的关键挑战，证明了分层多代理方法在硬件设计自动化中的有效性，为AI算法到专用硬件的映射提供了新途径。

Abstract: As program workloads (e.g., AI) increase in size and algorithmic complexity,
the primary challenge lies in their high dimensionality, encompassing computing
cores, array sizes, and memory hierarchies. To overcome these obstacles,
innovative approaches are required. Agile chip design has already benefited
from machine learning integration at various stages, including logic synthesis,
placement, and routing. With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently
demonstrating impressive proficiency in Hardware Description Language (HDL)
generation, it is promising to extend their abilities to 2.5D integration, an
advanced technique that saves area overhead and development costs. However,
LLM-driven chiplet design faces challenges such as flatten design, high
validation cost and imprecise parameter optimization, which limit its chiplet
design capability. To address this, we propose MAHL, a hierarchical LLM-based
chiplet design generation framework that features six agents which
collaboratively enable AI algorithm-hardware mapping, including hierarchical
description generation, retrieval-augmented code generation, diverseflow-based
validation, and multi-granularity design space exploration. These components
together enhance the efficient generation of chiplet design with optimized
Power, Performance and Area (PPA). Experiments show that MAHL not only
significantly improves the generation accuracy of simple RTL design, but also
increases the generation accuracy of real-world chiplet design, evaluated by
Pass@5, from 0 to 0.72 compared to conventional LLMs under the best-case
scenario. Compared to state-of-the-art CLARIE (expert-based), MAHL achieves
comparable or even superior PPA results under certain optimization objectives.

While industry adoption of RAG is now beginning, there is a significant lack of
research on its practical application in industrial contexts. To address this

(1) an overview of industry use cases, (2) a consolidated list of system
requirements, (3) key challenges and lessons learned from practical

main findings show that current RAG applications are mostly limited to
domain-specific QA tasks, with systems still in prototype stages; industry

Abstract: Heliophysics is central to understanding and forecasting space weather events
and solar activity. Despite decades of high-resolution observations from the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), most models remain task-specific and
constrained by scarce labeled data, limiting their capacity to generalize
across solar phenomena. We introduce Surya, a 366M parameter foundation model
for heliophysics designed to learn general-purpose solar representations from
multi-instrument SDO observations, including eight Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA) channels and five Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) products. Surya
employs a spatiotemporal transformer architecture with spectral gating and
long--short range attention, pretrained on high-resolution solar image
forecasting tasks and further optimized through autoregressive rollout tuning.
Zero-shot evaluations demonstrate its ability to forecast solar dynamics and
flare events, while downstream fine-tuning with parameter-efficient Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) shows strong performance on solar wind forecasting, active
region segmentation, solar flare forecasting, and EUV spectra. Surya is the
first foundation model in heliophysics that uses time advancement as a pretext
task on full-resolution SDO data. Its novel architecture and performance
suggest that the model is able to learn the underlying physics behind solar
evolution.

Abstract: The trustworthiness of AI is considered essential to the adoption and
application of AI systems. However, the meaning of trust varies across
industry, research and policy spaces. Studies suggest that professionals who
develop and use AI regard an AI system as trustworthy based on their personal
experiences and social relations at work. Studies about trust in AI and the
constructs that aim to operationalise trust in AI (e.g., consistency,
reliability, explainability and accountability). However, the majority of
existing studies about trust in AI are situated in Western, Educated,
Industrialised, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. The few studies about
trust and AI in Africa do not include the views of people who develop, study or
use AI in their work. In this study, we surveyed 157 people with professional
and/or educational interests in AI from 25 African countries, to explore how
they conceptualised trust in AI. Most respondents had links with workshops
about trust and AI in Africa in Namibia and Ghana. Respondents' educational
background, transnational mobility, and country of origin influenced their
concerns about AI systems. These factors also affected their levels of distrust
in certain AI applications and their emphasis on specific principles designed
to foster trust. Respondents often expressed that their values are guided by
the communities in which they grew up and emphasised communal relations over
individual freedoms. They described trust in many ways, including applying
nuances of Afro-relationalism to constructs in international discourse, such as
reliability and reliance. Thus, our exploratory study motivates more empirical
research about the ways trust is practically enacted and experienced in African
social realities of AI design, use and governance.

Abstract: Over time, software systems have reached a level of complexity that makes it
difficult for their developers and users to explain particular decisions made
by them. In this paper, we focus on the explainability of component-based
systems for Question Answering (QA). These components often conduct processes
driven by AI methods, in which behavior and decisions cannot be clearly
explained or justified, s.t., even for QA experts interpreting the executed
process and its results is hard. To address this challenge, we present an
approach that considers the components' input and output data flows as a source
for representing the behavior and provide explanations for the components,
enabling users to comprehend what happened. In the QA framework used here, the
data flows of the components are represented as SPARQL queries (inputs) and RDF
triples (outputs). Hence, we are also providing valuable insights on
verbalization regarding these data types. In our experiments, the approach
generates explanations while following template-based settings (baseline) or
via the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with different configurations
(automatic generation). Our evaluation shows that the explanations generated
via LLMs achieve high quality and mostly outperform template-based approaches
according to the users' ratings. Therefore, it enables us to automatically
explain the behavior and decisions of QA components to humans while using RDF
and SPARQL as a context for explanations.

Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in vision
and language, yet their potential for general machine signal modeling-covering
acoustic, vibration, and other industrial sensor data-remains under-explored.
Existing approach using sub-band-based encoders has achieved competitive
results but are limited by fixed input lengths, and the absence of explicit
frequency positional encoding. In this work, we propose a novel foundation
model that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with relative
frequency positional embeddings, enabling precise spectral localization across
arbitrary sampling configurations. The model supports inputs of arbitrary
length without padding or segmentation, producing a concise embedding that
retains both temporal and spectral fidelity. We evaluate our method on SIREN
(https://github.com/yucongzh/SIREN), a newly introduced large-scale benchmark
for machine signal encoding that unifies multiple datasets, including all DCASE
task 2 challenges (2020-2025) and widely-used industrial signal corpora.
Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in
anomaly detection and fault identification, confirming the effectiveness and
generalization capability of the proposed model. We open-sourced ECHO on

Abstract: Large Artificial Intelligence (AI) training workloads spanning several tens
of thousands of GPUs present unique power management challenges. These arise
due to the high variability in power consumption during the training. Given the
synchronous nature of these jobs, during every iteration there is a
computation-heavy phase, where each GPU works on the local data, and a
communication-heavy phase where all the GPUs synchronize on the data. Because
compute-heavy phases require much more power than communication phases, large
power swings occur. The amplitude of these power swings is ever increasing with
the increase in the size of training jobs. An even bigger challenge arises from
the frequency spectrum of these power swings which, if harmonized with critical
frequencies of utilities, can cause physical damage to the power grid
infrastructure. Therefore, to continue scaling AI training workloads safely, we
need to stabilize the power of such workloads. This paper introduces the
challenge with production data and explores innovative solutions across the
stack: software, GPU hardware, and datacenter infrastructure. We present the
pros and cons of each of these approaches and finally present a multi-pronged
approach to solving the challenge. The proposed solutions are rigorously tested
using a combination of real hardware and Microsoft's in-house cloud power
simulator, providing critical insights into the efficacy of these interventions
under real-world conditions.

Abstract: Local life service is a vital scenario in Kuaishou App, where video
recommendation is intrinsically linked with store's location information. Thus,
recommendation in our scenario is challenging because we should take into
account user's interest and real-time location at the same time. In the face of
such complex scenarios, end-to-end generative recommendation has emerged as a
new paradigm, such as OneRec in the short video scenario, OneSug in the search
scenario, and EGA in the advertising scenario. However, in local life service,
an end-to-end generative recommendation model has not yet been developed as
there are some key challenges to be solved. The first challenge is how to make
full use of geographic information. The second challenge is how to balance
multiple objectives, including user interests, the distance between user and
stores, and some other business objectives. To address the challenges, we
propose OneLoc. Specifically, we leverage geographic information from different
perspectives: (1) geo-aware semantic ID incorporates both video and geographic
information for tokenization, (2) geo-aware self-attention in the encoder
leverages both video location similarity and user's real-time location, and (3)
neighbor-aware prompt captures rich context information surrounding users for
generation. To balance multiple objectives, we use reinforcement learning and
propose two reward functions, i.e., geographic reward and GMV reward. With the
above design, OneLoc achieves outstanding offline and online performance. In
fact, OneLoc has been deployed in local life service of Kuaishou App. It serves
400 million active users daily, achieving 21.016% and 17.891% improvements in
terms of gross merchandise value (GMV) and orders numbers.

Abstract: Large-scale industrial recommendation systems typically employ a two-stage
paradigm of retrieval and ranking to handle huge amounts of information. Recent
research focuses on improving the performance of retrieval model. A promising
way is to introduce extensive information about users and items. On one hand,
lifelong sequential behavior is valuable. Existing lifelong behavior modeling
methods in ranking stage focus on the interaction of lifelong behavior and
candidate items from retrieval stage. In retrieval stage, it is difficult to
utilize lifelong behavior because of a large corpus of candidate items. On the
other hand, existing retrieval methods mostly relay on interaction information,
potentially disregarding valuable multi-modal information. To solve these
problems, we represent the pioneering exploration of leveraging multi-modal
information and lifelong sequence model within the advanced tree-based
retrieval model. We propose Multi-modal Indexing and Searching with lifelong
Sequence (MISS), which contains a multi-modal index tree and a multi-modal
lifelong sequence modeling module. Specifically, for better index structure, we
propose multi-modal index tree, which is built using the multi-modal embedding
to precisely represent item similarity. To precisely capture diverse user
interests in user lifelong sequence, we propose collaborative general search
unit (Co-GSU) and multi-modal general search unit (MM-GSU) for
multi-perspective interests searching.

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly
mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and
human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant
challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty
in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination
and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6
stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans
and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces
the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity
(HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and
agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,
intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.
The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red
team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future
research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral
disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to
provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and
trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

Conclusion: uAGNN是异配性图中无监督社区检测的有效工具，能够克服传统方法的局限性

Abstract: Community detection in graphs aims to cluster nodes into meaningful groups, a
task particularly challenging in heterophilic graphs, where nodes sharing
similarities and membership to the same community are typically distantly
connected. This is particularly evident when this task is tackled by graph
neural networks, since they rely on an inherently local message passing scheme
to learn the node representations that serve to cluster nodes into communities.
In this work, we argue that the ability to propagate long-range information
during message passing is key to effectively perform community detection in
heterophilic graphs. To this end, we introduce the Unsupervised Antisymmetric
Graph Neural Network (uAGNN), a novel unsupervised community detection approach
leveraging non-dissipative dynamical systems to ensure stability and to
propagate long-range information effectively. By employing antisymmetric weight
matrices, uAGNN captures both local and global graph structures, overcoming the
limitations posed by heterophilic scenarios. Extensive experiments across ten
datasets demonstrate uAGNN's superior performance in high and medium
heterophilic settings, where traditional methods fail to exploit long-range
dependencies. These results highlight uAGNN's potential as a powerful tool for
unsupervised community detection in diverse graph environments.

Abstract: Engineering education has historically been constrained by rigid,
standardized frameworks, often neglecting students' diverse learning needs and
interests. While significant advancements have been made in online and
personalized education within K-12 and foundational sciences, engineering
education at both undergraduate and graduate levels continues to lag in
adopting similar innovations. Traditional evaluation methods, such as exams and
homework assignments, frequently overlook individual student requirements,
impeding personalized educational experiences. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces the Personalized AI-Powered Progressive Learning (PAPPL)
platform, an advanced Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) designed specifically
for engineering education. It highlights the development of a scalable,
data-driven tutoring environment leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to
enhance personalized learning across diverse academic disciplines, particularly
in STEM fields. PAPPL integrates core ITS components including the expert
module, student module, tutor module, and user interface, and utilizes GPT-4o,
a sophisticated large language model (LLM), to deliver context-sensitive and
pedagogically sound hints based on students' interactions. The system uniquely
records student attempts, detects recurring misconceptions, and generates
progressively targeted feedback, providing personalized assistance that adapts
dynamically to each student's learning profile. Additionally, PAPPL offers
instructors detailed analytics, empowering evidence-based adjustments to
teaching strategies. This study provides a fundamental framework for the
progression of Generative ITSs scalable to all education levels, delivering

multiple U-Net variants augmented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
classifiers. To enhance interpretability and clinical relevance, we integrate
xAI methods such as Grad-CAM and Saliency Maps. Model performance is assessed
using AUC for classification and PSNR/SSIM for reconstruction quality, along
with qualitative ROI visualizations. Our results demonstrate that ResNet50
consistently excels in classification and ROI identification, outperforming
transformer-based models under the constraints of the MRNet dataset. While
hybrid U-Net + MLP approaches show potential for leveraging spatial features in
reconstruction and interpretability, their classification performance remains
lower. Grad-CAM consistently provided the most clinically meaningful
explanations across architectures. Overall, CNN-based transfer learning emerges
as the most effective approach for this dataset, while future work with

Motivation: 揭示AI治疗规划代理的不透明决策过程，增强临床医生对自动化治疗规划的信任，并启发新的自动规划策略。

Method: 使用基于Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER)网络的AI代理，应用可解释AI方法分析从剂量-体积直方图(DVH)输入到治疗规划参数调优决策的归因关系，评估不同训练阶段代理的规划效果和效率。

Result: 高性能ACER代理能够有效识别剂量违规区域，采用更少的调优步骤(12-13 vs 22)，具有更集中的调参空间和更低的熵值(0.3 vs 0.6)，表现出与人类专家相似的全局调参策略。

Conclusion: ACER代理通过渐进学习能够像熟练的人类规划师一样识别剂量违规并采取适当的调参行动，提高治疗规划质量。

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to uncover the opaque decision-making process of
an artificial intelligence (AI) agent for automatic treatment planning.
  Approach: We examined a previously developed AI agent based on the
Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER) network, which automatically tunes
treatment planning parameters (TPPs) for inverse planning in prostate cancer
intensity modulated radiotherapy. We selected multiple checkpoint ACER agents
from different stages of training and applied an explainable AI (EXAI) method
to analyze the attribution from dose-volume histogram (DVH) inputs to
TPP-tuning decisions. We then assessed each agent's planning efficacy and
efficiency and evaluated their policy and final TPP tuning spaces. Combining
these analyses, we systematically examined how ACER agents generated
high-quality treatment plans in response to different DVH inputs.
  Results: Attribution analysis revealed that ACER agents progressively learned
to identify dose-violation regions from DVH inputs and promote appropriate
TPP-tuning actions to mitigate them. Organ-wise similarities between DVH
attributions and dose-violation reductions ranged from 0.25 to 0.5 across
tested agents. Agents with stronger attribution-violation similarity required
fewer tuning steps (~12-13 vs. 22), exhibited a more concentrated TPP-tuning
space with lower entropy (~0.3 vs. 0.6), converged on adjusting only a few
TPPs, and showed smaller discrepancies between practical and theoretical tuning
steps. Putting together, these findings indicate that high-performing ACER
agents can effectively identify dose violations from DVH inputs and employ a
global tuning strategy to achieve high-quality treatment planning, much like
skilled human planners.
  Significance: Better interpretability of the agent's decision-making process
may enhance clinician trust and inspire new strategies for automatic treatment
planning.

Motivation: 人类在阅读过程中经常遇到信息冲突或超出理解能力的情况，导致困惑。研究旨在通过神经科学方法理解阅读困惑的机制，为开发自适应系统提供基础。

Method: 使用EEG和眼动追踪技术收集11名成年参与者的神经和注视数据，通过N400事件相关电位分析语义不一致性，并整合眼动行为标记，采用机器学习方法构建多模态分类模型。

Result: 多模态（EEG+眼动）模型比单模态基线分类准确率提高4-22%，平均加权参与者准确率达到77.3%，最佳准确率为89.6%。研究发现大脑颞叶区域在困惑神经特征中起主导作用。

Abstract: Humans regularly navigate an overwhelming amount of information via text
media, whether reading articles, browsing social media, or interacting with
chatbots. Confusion naturally arises when new information conflicts with or
exceeds a reader's comprehension or prior knowledge, posing a challenge for
learning. In this study, we present a multimodal investigation of
reading-induced confusion using EEG and eye tracking. We collected neural and
gaze data from 11 adult participants as they read short paragraphs sampled from
diverse, real-world sources. By isolating the N400 event-related potential
(ERP), a well-established neural marker of semantic incongruence, and
integrating behavioral markers from eye tracking, we provide a detailed
analysis of the neural and behavioral correlates of confusion during
naturalistic reading. Using machine learning, we show that multimodal (EEG +
eye tracking) models improve classification accuracy by 4-22% over unimodal
baselines, reaching an average weighted participant accuracy of 77.3% and a
best accuracy of 89.6%. Our results highlight the dominance of the brain's
temporal regions in these neural signatures of confusion, suggesting avenues
for wearable, low-electrode brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for real-time
monitoring. These findings lay the foundation for developing adaptive systems
that dynamically detect and respond to user confusion, with potential
applications in personalized learning, human-computer interaction, and

Conclusion: 该方法为多目标Stackelberg博弈中的收益操纵问题提供了有效解决方案，能够在未知追随者偏好情况下实现长期效用最大化。

Abstract: We study payoff manipulation in repeated multi-objective Stackelberg games,
where a leader may strategically influence a follower's deterministic best
response, e.g., by offering a share of their own payoff. We assume that the
follower's utility function, representing preferences over multiple objectives,
is unknown but linear, and its weight parameter must be inferred through
interaction. This introduces a sequential decision-making challenge for the
leader, who must balance preference elicitation with immediate utility
maximisation. We formalise this problem and propose manipulation policies based
on expected utility (EU) and long-term expected utility (longEU), which guide
the leader in selecting actions and offering incentives that trade off
short-term gains with long-term impact. We prove that under infinite repeated
interactions, longEU converges to the optimal manipulation. Empirical results
across benchmark environments demonstrate that our approach improves cumulative
leader utility while promoting mutually beneficial outcomes, all without
requiring explicit negotiation or prior knowledge of the follower's utility
function.

Abstract: The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education is undergoing a rapid
transformation, moving beyond its historical function as an instructional tool
towards a new potential as an active participant in the learning process. This
shift is driven by the emergence of agentic AI, autonomous systems capable of
proactive, goal-directed action. However, the field lacks a robust conceptual
framework to understand, design, and evaluate this new paradigm of human-AI
interaction in learning. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel
conceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as
a tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of
escalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an
Adaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a
Co-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator. Grounded in sociocultural
theories of learning and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), this
framework provides a structured vocabulary for analysing the shifting roles and
responsibilities between human and AI agents. The paper further engages in a
critical discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of collaboration,
examining whether an AI, lacking genuine consciousness or shared
intentionality, can be considered a true collaborator. We conclude that while
AI may not achieve authentic phenomenological partnership, it can be designed
as a highly effective functional collaborator. This distinction has significant
implications for pedagogy, instructional design, and the future research agenda
for AI in education, urging a shift in focus towards creating learning
environments that harness the complementary strengths of both human and AI.

Conclusion: Cristal通过构建更高质量的选择网络，在布尔优化和技术映射方面显著优于现有方法，为电子设计自动化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Choice network construction is a critical technique for alleviating
structural bias issues in Boolean optimization, equivalence checking, and
technology mapping. Previous works on lossless synthesis utilize independent
optimization to generate multiple snapshots, and use simulation and SAT solvers
to identify functionally equivalent nodes. These nodes are then merged into a
subject graph with choice nodes. However, such methods often neglect the
quality of these choices, raising the question of whether they truly contribute
to effective technology mapping.
  This paper introduces Cristal, a novel methodology and framework for
constructing Boolean choice networks. Specifically, Cristal introduces a new
flow of choice network-based synthesis and mapping, including representative
logic cone search, structural mutation for generating diverse choice structures
via equality saturation, and priority-ranking choice selection along with
choice network construction and validation. Through these techniques, Cristal
constructs fewer but higher-quality choices.
  Our experimental results demonstrate that Cristal outperforms the
state-of-the-art Boolean choice network construction implemented in ABC in the
post-mapping stage, achieving average reductions of 3.85%/8.35% (area/delay) in
delay-oriented mode, 0.11%/2.74% in area-oriented mode, and a 63.77% runtime

Conclusion: 针对性的奖励设计对于实用的短距离人形机器人运动控制至关重要，该方法为SE(2)目标位姿控制提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Humanoids operating in real-world workspaces must frequently execute
task-driven, short-range movements to SE(2) target poses. To be practical,
these transitions must be fast, robust, and energy efficient. While
learning-based locomotion has made significant progress, most existing methods
optimize for velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in
inefficient, marching-style behavior when applied to short-range tasks. In this
work, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that directly optimizes
humanoid locomotion for SE(2) targets. Central to this approach is a new
constellation-based reward function that encourages natural and efficient
target-oriented movement. To evaluate performance, we introduce a benchmarking
framework that measures energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count
on a distribution of SE(2) goals. Our results show that the proposed approach
consistently outperforms standard methods and enables successful transfer from
simulation to hardware, highlighting the importance of targeted reward design
for practical short-range humanoid locomotion.

Conclusion: 该方法为开发更适应和可泛化的软机器人控制器铺平了道路，有效解决了软机器人材料退化带来的控制挑战

Abstract: Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft
robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require
precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other
physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of
these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned
in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different
physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots,
as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a
domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative
adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain
to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to
adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a
domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure
signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in
both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments
across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise
perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP
effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more
adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.

Abstract: Speaker embeddings are promising identity-related features that can enhance
the identity assignment performance of a tracking system by leveraging its
spatial predictions, i.e, by performing identity reassignment. Common speaker
embedding extractors usually struggle with short temporal contexts and
overlapping speech, which imposes long-term identity reassignment to exploit
longer temporal contexts. However, this increases the probability of tracking
system errors, which in turn impacts negatively on identity reassignment. To
address this, we propose a Knowledge Distillation (KD) based training approach
for short context speaker embedding extraction from two speaker mixtures. We
leverage the spatial information of the speaker of interest using beamforming
to reduce overlap. We study the feasibility of performing identity reassignment
over blocks of fixed size, i.e., blockwise identity reassignment, to go towards
a low-latency speaker embedding based tracking system. Results demonstrate that
our distilled models are effective at short-context embedding extraction and
more robust to overlap. Although, blockwise reassignment results indicate that
further work is needed to handle simultaneous speech more effectively.

Abstract: Generating physically realistic humanoid-object interactions (HOI) is a
fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing HOI generation approaches, such as
diffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible
contacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder
successful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of
generative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and
physically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion
Transformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,
object geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These
key actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into
smooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To
ensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy
trained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while
correcting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we
introduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the
control policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and
tracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates
realistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,
achieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and
enabling long-horizon manipulation tasks. Code will be released upon acceptance

particular, has been overlooked despite its significant impact on latency and
energy consumption. To address this, we introduce a novel CIM dataflow that
significantly reduces buffer traffic by maximizing data reuse and improving
memory utilization during depthwise convolution. The proposed dataflow is
grounded in solid theoretical principles, fully demonstrated in this paper.
When applied to MobileNet and EfficientNet models, our dataflow reduces buffer
traffic by 77.4-87.0%, leading to a total reduction in data traffic energy and
latency by 10.1-17.9% and 15.6-27.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline
(conventional weight-stationary dataflow).

Motivation: 现有笔记生成工具无法全面保留原始视频信息，也不能满足用户对多样化呈现格式和交互功能的需求，用户需要更有效的教学视频笔记生成方案

Method: 使用新颖的多模态管道从视频中提取层次结构和关键信息，提供交互界面让用户自定义笔记内容和呈现格式

Result: 技术评估和用户研究（N=36）显示，在客观指标上表现良好，用户反馈积极，证明了管道的有效性和系统的整体可用性

Conclusion: NoteIt系统能够有效解决教学视频笔记生成中的信息完整性和交互性问题，为用户提供了更好的数字笔记体验

Abstract: Users often take notes for instructional videos to access key knowledge later
without revisiting long videos. Automated note generation tools enable users to
obtain informative notes efficiently. However, notes generated by existing
research or off-the-shelf tools fail to preserve the information conveyed in
the original videos comprehensively, nor can they satisfy users' expectations
for diverse presentation formats and interactive features when using notes
digitally. In this work, we present NoteIt, a system, which automatically
converts instructional videos to interactable notes using a novel pipeline that
faithfully extracts hierarchical structure and multimodal key information from
videos. With NoteIt's interface, users can interact with the system to further
customize the content and presentation formats of the notes according to their
preferences. We conducted both a technical evaluation and a comparison user
study (N=36). The solid performance in objective metrics and the positive user
feedback demonstrated the effectiveness of the pipeline and the overall
usability of NoteIt. Project website: https://zhaorunning.github.io/NoteIt/

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of manual debugging, which nowadays

especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems.
Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can
possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease
this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in
conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations.
These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface
information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to
understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes.
Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based
Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated
explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if
developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our

Motivation: 研究动机在于发现当训练参考信号包含噪声时，SI-SDR作为目标函数会导致分离输出中出现不希望有的噪声，限制了语音分离系统的性能提升。

Method: 提出了一种增强参考信号的方法，使用WHAM!数据集对混合信号进行增强，训练模型避免学习噪声参考。使用非侵入式NISQA.v2指标评估模型性能。

Result: 结果显示分离语音中的噪声减少，但处理参考信号可能引入伪影，限制了整体质量提升。在WSJ0-2Mix和Libri2Mix测试集上发现SI-SDR与感知噪声度呈负相关。

Conclusion: 使用含噪声的参考信号训练SI-SDR目标会限制系统性能，增强参考信号可以减少噪声但可能引入伪影，需要更全面的评估指标。

Abstract: This paper examines the implications of using the Scale-Invariant
Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR) as both evaluation and training objective
in supervised speech separation, when the training references contain noise, as
is the case with the de facto benchmark WSJ0-2Mix. A derivation of the SI-SDR
with noisy references reveals that noise limits the achievable SI-SDR, or leads
to undesired noise in the separated outputs. To address this, a method is
proposed to enhance references and augment the mixtures with WHAM!, aiming to
train models that avoid learning noisy references. Two models trained on these
enhanced datasets are evaluated with the non-intrusive NISQA.v2 metric. Results
show reduced noise in separated speech but suggest that processing references
may introduce artefacts, limiting overall quality gains. Negative correlation
is found between SI-SDR and perceived noisiness across models on the WSJ0-2Mix
and Libri2Mix test sets, underlining the conclusion from the derivation.

Abstract: Credit card fraud detection (CCFD) is a critical application of Machine
Learning (ML) in the financial sector, where accurately identifying fraudulent
transactions is essential for mitigating financial losses. ML models have
demonstrated their effectiveness in fraud detection task, in particular with
the tabular dataset. While adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in
computer vision and deep learning, their impacts on the ML models, particularly
those trained on CCFD tabular datasets, remains largely unexplored. These
latent vulnerabilities pose significant threats to the security and stability
of the financial industry, especially in high-value transactions where losses
could be substantial. To address this gap, in this paper, we present a holistic
framework that investigate the robustness of CCFD ML model against adversarial
perturbations under different circumstances. Specifically, the gradient-based
attack methods are incorporated into the tabular credit card transaction data
in both black- and white-box adversarial attacks settings. Our findings confirm
that tabular data is also susceptible to subtle perturbations, highlighting the
need for heightened awareness among financial technology practitioners
regarding ML model security and trustworthiness. Furthermore, the experiments
by transferring adversarial samples from gradient-based attack method to
non-gradient-based models also verify our findings. Our results demonstrate
that such attacks remain effective, emphasizing the necessity of developing
robust defenses for CCFD algorithms.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models
for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models
are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches
then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems
based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a
discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven
approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon
of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic
and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an
additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process
follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a
guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach
with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

Abstract: We prove a square-root space simulation for deterministic multitape Turing
machines, showing ${\rm TIME}[[t] \subseteq {\rm SPACE}[O(\sqrt{t})]$. The key
step is a Height Compression Theorem that uniformly (and in logspace) reshapes
the canonical left-deep succinct computation tree for a block-respecting run
into a binary tree whose evaluation-stack depth along any DFS path is $O(\log
T)$ for $T = \lceil t/b \rceil$, while preserving $O(b)$ work at leaves, $O(1)$
at internal nodes, and edges that are logspace-checkable; semantic correctness
across merges is witnessed by an exact $O(b)$ window replay at the unique
interface. The proof uses midpoint (balanced) recursion, a per-path potential
that bounds simultaneously active interfaces by $O(\log T)$, and an
indegree-capping replacement of multiway merges by balanced binary combiners.
Algorithmically, an Algebraic Replay Engine with constant-degree maps over a
constant-size field, together with pointerless DFS and index-free streaming,
ensures constant-size per-level tokens and eliminates wide counters, yielding
the additive tradeoff $S(b)=O(b + \log(t/b))$ for block sizes $b \ge b_0$ with
$b_0 = \Theta(\log t)$, which at the canonical choice $b = \Theta(\sqrt{t})$
gives $O(\sqrt{t})$ space; the $b_0$ threshold rules out degenerate blocks
where addressing scratch would dominate the window footprint. The construction
is uniform, relativizes, and is robust to standard model choices. Consequences
include branching-program upper bounds $2^{O(\sqrt{s})}$ for size-$s$
bounded-fan-in circuits, tightened quadratic-time lower bounds for
SPACE$[n]$-complete problems via the standard hierarchy argument, and
$O(\sqrt{t})$-space certifying interpreters; under explicit locality
assumptions, the framework extends to geometric $d$-dimensional models.

Abstract: The explosive growth of the video game industry has created an urgent need
for recommendation systems that can scale with expanding catalogs and maintain
user engagement. While prior work has explored accuracy and diversity in
recommendations, existing models underutilize playtime, a rich behavioral
signal unique to gaming platforms, and overlook the potential of multimodal
information to enhance diversity. In this paper, we propose DP2Rec, a novel
Dual-Phase Playtime-guided Recommendation model designed to jointly optimize
accuracy and diversity. First, we introduce a playtime-guided interest
intensity exploration module that separates strong and weak preferences via
dual-beta modeling, enabling fine-grained user profiling and more accurate
recommendations. Second, we present a playtime-guided multimodal random walks
module that simulates player exploration using transitions guided by both
playtime-derived interest similarity and multimodal semantic similarity. This
mechanism preserves core preferences while promoting cross-category discovery
through latent semantic associations and adaptive category balancing. Extensive
experiments on a real-world game dataset show that DP2Rec outperforms existing
methods in both recommendation accuracy and diversity.

Abstract: Live cell culture is crucial in biomedical studies for analyzing cell

live cells imaged with bright-field microscopy. While many segmentation
approaches exist for microscopic images, none consistently address the
challenges of bright-field live-cell imaging with high throughput, where
temporal phenotype changes, low contrast, noise, and motion-induced blur from
cellular movement remain major obstacles. We developed a low-cost CNN-based
pipeline incorporating comparative analysis of frozen encoders within a unified
U-Net architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms, instance-aware systems,
adaptive loss functions, hard instance retraining, dynamic learning rates,
progressive mechanisms to mitigate overfitting, and an ensemble technique. The
model was validated on a public dataset featuring diverse live cell variants,
showing consistent competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods, achieving 93%
test accuracy and an average F1-score of 89% (std. 0.07) on low-contrast,
noisy, and blurry images. Notably, the model was trained primarily on
bright-field images with limited exposure to phase-contrast microscopy (<10%),
yet it generalized effectively to the phase-contrast LIVECell dataset,
demonstrating modality, robustness and strong performance. This highlights its
potential for real-world laboratory deployment across imaging conditions. The
model requires minimal compute power and is adaptable using basic deep learning
setups such as Google Colab, making it practical for training on other cell
variants. Our pipeline outperforms existing methods in robustness and precision
for bright-field microscopy segmentation. The code and dataset are available

Abstract: Neuronal spikes directly drive muscles and endow animals with agile
movements, but applying the spike-based control signals to actuators in
artificial sensor-motor systems inevitably causes a collapse of learning. We
developed a system that can vary \emph{the number of independent synaptic
bundles} in sensor-to-motor connections. This paper demonstrates the following
four findings: (i) Learning collapses once the number of motor neurons or the
number of independent synaptic bundles exceeds a critical limit. (ii) The
probability of learning failure is increased by a smaller number of motor
neurons, while (iii) if learning succeeds, a smaller number of motor neurons
leads to faster learning. (iv) The number of weight updates that move in the
opposite direction of the optimal weight can quantitatively explain these
results. The functions of spikes remain largely unknown. Identifying the
parameter range in which learning systems using spikes can be constructed will
make it possible to study the functions of spikes that were previously
inaccessible due to the difficulty of learning.

Abstract: Recently, the Manna-Pnueli Hierarchy has been used to define the temporal
logics LTLfp and PPLTLp, which allow to use finite-trace LTLf/PPLTL techniques
in infinite-trace settings while achieving the expressiveness of full LTL. In
this paper, we present the first actual solvers for reactive synthesis in these
logics. These are based on games on graphs that leverage DFA-based techniques
from LTLf/PPLTL to construct the game arena. We start with a symbolic solver
based on Emerson-Lei games, which reduces lower-class properties (guarantee,
safety) to higher ones (recurrence, persistence) before solving the game. We
then introduce Manna-Pnueli games, which natively embed Manna-Pnueli objectives
into the arena. These games are solved by composing solutions to a DAG of
simpler Emerson-Lei games, resulting in a provably more efficient approach. We
implemented the solvers and practically evaluated their performance on a range
of representative formulas. The results show that Manna-Pnueli games often
offer significant advantages, though not universally, indicating that combining
both approaches could further enhance practical performance.

Abstract: Background: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a deep
learning-based automated segmentation method for hepatic anatomy (i.e.,
parenchyma, tumors, portal vein, hepatic vein and biliary tree) from the
hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. This method should ease the
clinical workflow of preoperative planning.
  Methods: Manual segmentation was performed on hepatobiliary phase MRI scans
from 90 consecutive patients who underwent liver surgery between January 2020
and October 2023. A deep learning network (nnU-Net v1) was trained on 72
patients with an extra focus on thin structures and topography preservation.
Performance was evaluated on an 18-patient test set by comparing automated and
manual segmentations using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Following
clinical integration, 10 segmentations (assessment dataset) were generated
using the network and manually refined for clinical use to quantify required
adjustments using DSC.
  Results: In the test set, DSCs were 0.97+/-0.01 for liver parenchyma,
0.80+/-0.04 for hepatic vein, 0.79+/-0.07 for biliary tree, 0.77+/-0.17 for
tumors, and 0.74+/-0.06 for portal vein. Average tumor detection rate was
76.6+/-24.1%, with a median of one false-positive per patient. The assessment
dataset showed minor adjustments were required for clinical use of the 3D
models, with high DSCs for parenchyma (1.00+/-0.00), portal vein (0.98+/-0.01)
and hepatic vein (0.95+/-0.07). Tumor segmentation exhibited greater
variability (DSC 0.80+/-0.27). During prospective clinical use, the model
detected three additional tumors initially missed by radiologists.
  Conclusions: The proposed nnU-Net-based segmentation method enables accurate
and automated delineation of hepatic anatomy. This enables 3D planning to be
applied efficiently as a standard-of-care for every patient undergoing liver
surgery.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim
to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during
fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific
preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we
introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework
specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one
or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data
availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach
combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline
consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of
similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy
and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is
expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be
procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained
alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize
examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes
and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same
unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample
evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields
the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield
the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder
examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These
findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training:
prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning
tasks when using GRPO.

Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational
reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical
performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and
reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological
generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different
kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and
effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these
architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region
methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To
this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy
optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality
influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints
imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the
theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is
carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a
systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without
altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study
morphological generalization.

Conclusion: ABMLL为LLM的LoRA微调提供了一种计算高效且泛化能力强的解决方案，同时改进了不确定性量化

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a
cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However,
it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well
it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve
generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning
to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and
computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of
parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these
challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This
method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting
this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We
reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a
set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity
of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective
generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a
result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty
quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that
it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy
and expected calibration error.

Conclusion: RL的奖励函数确实是最好的流程奖励模型，为LLM中的复杂推理任务提供了鲁棒且成本效益高的解决方案

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen
into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods
that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low
sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently
trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or
LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this
paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and
search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function
learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding
downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to
learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely
eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the
resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a
heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning
chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task
generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including
mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our
unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,
matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,
our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.
These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best
PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex
reasoning tasks in LLMs.

Conclusion: DuPO是一个可扩展、通用且无需标注的LLM优化范式。

Abstract: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that
generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses
two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s
reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and
traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,
translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Semantic Energy显著改善了幻觉检测和不确定性估计性能。

Conclusion: Semantic Energy提供了更可靠的不确定性信号，可有效应用于下游任务如幻觉检测。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce
fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making.
Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations.
For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic
diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations.
However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to
capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in
certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel
uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs
by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic
clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better
captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across
multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves
hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable
signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

Motivation: LLM推理是在线多任务服务过程，能耗高且输出长度未知，需要优化调度效率并降低功耗。关键挑战是输出长度不确定性影响内存使用和处理时间。

Method: 利用机器学习预测输出长度区间，设计保守算法A_max（基于上限）和自适应算法A_min（基于下限动态调整）。A_min被证明具有对数级竞争比。

Result: 数值模拟显示A_min性能接近后见之明调度器，效率高且鲁棒性强。A_min仅依赖预测区间下限，设计优势明显。

Conclusion: A_min算法通过动态调整预测输出长度下限，有效解决了LLM推理调度中的不确定性挑战，在保证内存安全的同时实现了高效调度。

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference
scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task
service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM
processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,
it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power
consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key
challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known
upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and
processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms
that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the
prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each
request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which
schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to
prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as
prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to
potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted
lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during
inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale
competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,
highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.
Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the
prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output
length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major
challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers
appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on
inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of
continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to
selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary
models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete
tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.
We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed
one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient
descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot
encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We
provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement
an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.
Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to
three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four
adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In
addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial
suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of
optimized suffixes to different LLMs.

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the code quality and
security of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): Claude Sonnet 4,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2 90B, and OpenCoder 8B. While prior
research has assessed the functional performance of LLM-generated code, this
research tested LLM output from 4,442 Java coding assignments through
comprehensive static analysis using SonarQube. The findings suggest that
although LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of
software defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.
These defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared
weaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code
generation methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded
passwords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple
models. These results indicate that LLM-generated code requires verification in
order to be considered production-ready. This study found no direct correlation
between a model's functional performance (measured by Pass@1 rate of unit
tests) and the overall quality and security of its generated code, measured by
the number of SonarQube issues in benchmark solutions that passed the
functional tests. This suggests that functional benchmark performance score is
not a good indicator of overall code quality and security. The goal of this
study is not to rank LLM performance but to highlight that all evaluated models
appear to share certain weaknesses. Consequently, these findings support the
view that static analysis can be a valuable instrument for detecting latent
defects and an important safeguard for organizations that deploy AI in software
development.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that
aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given
textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models,
traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack
sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,
characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world
knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.
Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via
fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and
anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics
to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate
16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results
showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual
grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual
understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are
significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely
affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.
We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards
developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding
frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal
systems for complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling
large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has
inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However,
applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to
the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs
dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle
physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new
dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of
downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel
self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural
scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen
weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline
models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust
data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations
extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single

TL;DR: 提出了记忆摊销推理（MAI）框架，将认知建模为基于记忆潜在循环的推理而非梯度下降重计算，通过结构重用最小化熵并实现上下文感知推理，建立了与强化学习的时间反转对偶关系

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI方法基于均匀采样和从头优化，但智能本质上是非遍历性的，需要结构化重用先前的推理轨迹来解决现代AI面临的计算瓶颈问题

Method: MAI框架将认知建模为在记忆潜在循环上的推理，通过delta同调理论提供数学基础，将每个皮层柱建模为在循环一致记忆状态上的局部推理算子

Result: 建立了MAI与强化学习的时间反转对偶关系：RL从奖励向前传播价值，MAI从记忆向后重建潜在原因，为能量高效推理提供了路径

Conclusion: MAI提供了一个基于结构、重用和记忆的统一生物学基础智能理论，对实现AGI具有深远意义

Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform
sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior
inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a
formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles
in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems
encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling
context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive
systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent
manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of
delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for
Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a
local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we
establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:
whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes
backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient
inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI
thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on
structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications
of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Conclusion: Diff-In提供了一种准确、高效且可扩展的影响函数估计方法，突破了传统方法对模型凸性的依赖，为数据中心化任务提供了强有力的分析工具

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial
intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to
model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.
However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many
of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.
These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.
In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's
influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive
learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the
sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across
successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we
approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the
need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a
second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to
that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved
by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently
approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the
approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower
approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive
experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset
selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale
vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data
points and outperforms strong baselines.

Conclusion: HERAKLES框架通过动态技能编译和LLM高层控制，为开放环境中的分层自主目标学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing
complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling
efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to
keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated
growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent
approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and
language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization
capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing
approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a
hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such
designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally
diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a
framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously
compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast
neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the
high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the
high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and
generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We
evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales
effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill
compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over
time.

Abstract: Model distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from large-scale models
to compact student models, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained
environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from
computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive
distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of
high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest
neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the
embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student
learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight
teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling
direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard
NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently
matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3%
on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise
of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and

Abstract: What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem
of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models,
each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no
access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take
insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a
singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we
reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized
Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization
approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural
weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but
enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME
produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and
model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results
suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight
aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.

Abstract: As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes
increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and
more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal
performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for
language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in
this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,
value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute
allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed
compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes
to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between
model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we
call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for
small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use
of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this
phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize
compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for
compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning
but adapted to TD learning.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from speech is a challenging task that requires capturing
both linguistic and paralinguistic cues, with critical applications in
human-computer interaction and mental health monitoring. Recent works have
highlighted the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks
outside of the sole natural language area. In particular, recent approaches
have investigated coupling LLMs with other data modalities by using pre-trained
backbones and different fusion mechanisms. This work proposes a novel approach
that fine-tunes an LLM with audio and text representations for emotion
prediction. Our method first extracts audio features using an audio feature
extractor, which are then mapped into the LLM's representation space via a
learnable interfacing module. The LLM takes as input (1) the transformed audio
features, (2) additional features in the form of natural language (e.g., the
transcript), and (3) a textual prompt describing the emotion prediction task.
To efficiently adapt the LLM to this multimodal task, we employ Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental
results on standard emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our model
outperforms all but one existing Speech-Text LLMs in the literature, while
requiring less than half the parameters of competing approaches. This
highlights our approach's effectiveness in integrating multi-modal inputs for
speech-based emotion understanding while maintaining significant computational
efficiency.

Abstract: Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small
input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by
training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using
specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more
efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are
adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust
fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the
model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss
objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,
and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust
generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when
exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these
design choices influence generalization remains an open question with
significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study
spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3
adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200
robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this
is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.
While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are
increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in
a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both
confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising
research directions and offering practical guidance.

Abstract: While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the
brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning
meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to
limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation
models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer
architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language
models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG
data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large
models often incurred high computational costs during both training and
inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.
In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon
Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured
state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the
temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were
then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion
transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple
University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art
approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method
outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight.
These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current
FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.

Abstract: The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and
sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost,
functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable
insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks
grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for
reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization.
Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of
functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically,
ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet,
a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across
feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully
connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision
benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate
biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in
ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST)
mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a
Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on
principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while
improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer

Conclusion: Organ-Agents是一个可信、可解释且可推广的数字孪生系统，适用于精准诊断、治疗模拟和重症监护中的假设测试。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new
possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce
Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via
LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,
cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on
system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination
using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from
7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution
trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high
simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and
robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU
patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution
shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical
multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with
coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care
physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert
ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations
under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and
APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early
warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops
(<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results
position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital
twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in
critical care.

Motivation: Shapley值是机器学习中特征重要性归因的重要方法，但计算复杂度随特征数量指数增长，特别是在概率模型（如高斯过程）中更加困难，限制了实际应用。

Method: 针对FANOVA GP这类显式建模所有主效应和交互作用的高斯过程，利用闭式Möbius表示和受牛顿恒等式启发的递归算法，在二次时间内计算精确的随机Shapley值。

Result: 实现了局部实例解释和全局敏感性分析的精确Shapley值计算，计算效率显著提升，并能提供包含不确定性的解释。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了可解释AI的实用性，为结构化概率模型提供了更可扩展、公理合理且不确定性感知的解释方法。

Abstract: Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing
importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact
computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,
severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The
challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as
in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather
than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling
higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class
of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and
interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global
explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise
explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components
and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,
capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global
explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and
compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the
model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)
M\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive
algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean
and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable
AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable,
axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions
generated by structured probabilistic models.

Abstract: This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer
architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address
the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in
cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer
module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using
a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual
semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to
extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and
parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to
dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision,
enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input
modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed,
covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task
scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's
temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate
performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity
analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios,
and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision,
recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection
performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior
capability in complex cloud environments.

Conclusion: 验证了在深度强化学习中使用正交多项式基的潜力，同时强调了模型复杂度涉及的权衡

Abstract: The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the
ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the
action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer
perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes
inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel
architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev
polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature
representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of
Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more
efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on
the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a
comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a
moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic
performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also
find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a
high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the
potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning
while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

Abstract: Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the
vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor
interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we
introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language

reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly
reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling
interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological
properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity
and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence
variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with
significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming
existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both
optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first
LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with
RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent
peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

Motivation: 传统生成模型引导方法通过修改概率流向量场来实现，但这种方法可能破坏预训练模型的特性。SGFM旨在提供更灵活且理论保证的引导框架，保持向量场完整性。

Method: SGFM框架直接修改源分布，保持预训练向量场不变。将引导问题转化为从修改后的源分布进行采样的问题，支持用户灵活选择采样方法。

Conclusion: SGFM提供了一个灵活且理论保证的生成模型引导框架，与最优流匹配模型良好集成，保持了直线传输映射的特性。

Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the
probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this
paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,
which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained
vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined
problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that
SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide
bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an
approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.
The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose
the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we
systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for
asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with
optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the
vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,
image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction:
predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack
of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs
with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to
explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the
expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a
form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph
encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular
approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN
output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be
adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for
explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules
that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining
equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring
functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic
GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.

Result: 在四个基准测试上相比最先进基线平均提升4.04%的准确率

Conclusion: 有效的特征解耦不仅需要数学约束，还需要语义指导来锚定分离过程，ERIS框架成功实现了这一目标

Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant
representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models
inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in
spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,
current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required
to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework
to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that
effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also
semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key
mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an
energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance
for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a
weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between
domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their
interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances
robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that
ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy
across four benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various
real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social
media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to
their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant
computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and
processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce
these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the
essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's
predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation
approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level
optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and
original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this
sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn
linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent
and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph
condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a
novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition
(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an
informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.
Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD
effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up
to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive
performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is

Abstract: The prevalence of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches
has inspired growing research on measuring and mitigating bias in the ML
domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in
regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed
to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic
Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However,
there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of
our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness
measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation
algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement
methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates
how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our
experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core
could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and
even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of
various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio
estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further
research to enhance their reliability.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling
graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs
can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.
Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and
message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias
by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge
dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may
unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised
balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we
present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias
mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using
counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node
representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial
discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN
classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs
under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN
backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while
preserving high predictive performance.

Abstract: Compression-based distances (CD) offer a flexible and domain-agnostic means
of measuring similarity by identifying implicit information through
redundancies between data objects. However, as similarity features are derived
from the data, rather than defined as an input, it often proves difficult to
align with the task at hand, particularly in complex clustering or
classification settings. To address this issue, we introduce "context
steering," a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping
process. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically
a hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach "steers" the process by
systematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context
within a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored
embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We
validate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression
Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical
clustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.
Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world
audio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking a
fundamental shift in their application: from merely discovering inherent data
structures to actively shaping a feature space tailored to a specific
objective.

Imitation Learning (ACIL), where an action-constrained imitator aims to learn
from a demonstrative expert with larger action space. The fundamental challenge
of ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the
expert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this
mismatch through \textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which
replaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that
follows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints.
Specifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it
via Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the
expert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated
by DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks
and outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of
sample efficiency. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Limited data has become a major bottleneck in scaling up offline imitation
learning (IL). In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited
expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics
representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We
first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL
lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to
learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be
learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the
reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We
present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to
learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on
MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with
as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can
leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to
walk from a few real-world demonstrations.

Conclusion: 周期漂移是跨设备联邦学习中的重要问题，与客户端漂移相互作用会加剧性能下降。FedEve框架能有效缓解这两种漂移的负面影响

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple
clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their private
data. Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in
poor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized
as one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple
local updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift
arises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied
well. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients
at each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that
deviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift
since the optimization objective shifts with every round.
  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client
drift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on
cross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these
issues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated
method, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to
mitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our
approach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in
cross-device settings.

Conclusion: 简单的数据感知噪声整形可以在不改变架构的情况下带来稳健的生成性能提升。

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding
structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states
redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we
introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically
along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling
noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning
important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg
diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse
scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales
only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,
mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -
consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier
toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise
shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP),
a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong
performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement
learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous
learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is
overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the
human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided
by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of
learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a
sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found
that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in
continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC
implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model
(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks
incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP
performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models
on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.
Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the
network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new
tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to
RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors
into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

Conclusion: DRILL通过离散分布估计和解耦分布对齐有效解决了半监督回归中的过拟合和伪标签质量问题

Abstract: Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of
samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently
received considerable attention across various applications, including computer
vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing
semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the
general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods
heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to
learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address
these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation
distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the
semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task
into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to
better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of
overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled
Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket
between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the
student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher.
Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate
that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing
methods.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order
relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains,
including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural
networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn
latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive
tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small
number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then
utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a
cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego
long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly
increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also
degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture
long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.
Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency
issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing
hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more
information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit
Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns
fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end
manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we
introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model
efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node
classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in
most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

Conclusion: STAS通过协同设计静态架构和动态计算策略，成功解决了SNN-based视觉Transformer中的核心挑战，实现了能效和精度的双重提升

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural
networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to
their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation
methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or
architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the
principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a
unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is
hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity
prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its
principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal
Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that
co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS
introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish
temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving
the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn,
allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform
two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes.
Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%,
and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA
models.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep
neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust
final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent
given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships
among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic
structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will
inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose
GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by
constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance
model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment
results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer
the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while
providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to
utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust
in performance across different training and architecture settings.

FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors
the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by
assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with

baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and
mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to
transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited

Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph
structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the
learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning
algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude
connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum
degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk
(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the
generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional
settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine
how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several
key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure
and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and
Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure
through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further
explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the
performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we
extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing
non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights
into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning
algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions,
\emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs
and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and
selection in practice.}

Abstract: Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces
challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to
scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically
operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in
memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility
for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization,
with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the
training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To
address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion
(SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space.
This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns,
significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large
graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing
fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves
significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable
or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to
unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable
and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in
generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by
decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.

Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a
large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that
the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with
careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small
number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models
trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we
push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single
latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show
that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model
obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models.
We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model
provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on
two different datasets.

Method: 使用符号回归科学发现(SRSD)基准问题，引入精心策划的可接受表达式列表和回调机制实现早期终止，对SymbolicRegression.jl和TiSR两个软件包进行基准测试。

Result: SymbolicRegression.jl的重新发现率从26.7%提升至44.7%，计算开销减少41.2%；TiSR的重新发现率达到69.4%，时间节省63%。

Conclusion: 新基准测试方法显著提高了符号回归算法的评估效率和准确性，为符号回归研究提供了更好的基准测试框架。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several
benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms.
However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the
recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra
systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks
continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these
issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback
mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic
regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by
Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and
TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate of
SymbolicRegression.jl from 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%.
Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's
rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于反事实生成的基线选择方法，用于医学图像的可解释性分析，通过变分自编码器生成临床正常但接近输入的基线，相比传统全零基线能提供更忠实和医学相关的归因结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学领域，深度学习模型的可解释性至关重要，但传统路径归因方法（如积分梯度）使用的基线（如全零输入）在医学上下文中往往语义无意义，因为缺失本身可能包含信息。现有方法缺乏针对每个输入动态选择基线的原则性方法。

Method: 提出反事实引导的基线选择方法，使用临床正常但接近输入的反事实作为基线。通过变分自编码器生成反事实基线，但该方法与生成模型无关，可适用于任何合适的反事实方法。

Result: 在三个不同的医学数据集上评估，实证表明反事实基线相比标准基线选择能产生更忠实和医学相关的归因结果。

Conclusion: 反事实基线为医学数据中有意义的特征缺失提供了更准确的表示，改进了传统基线选择方法在医学可解释性分析中的局限性。

Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge,
particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for
clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated
Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant
features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are
often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where
missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have
been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically
select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of
missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline
selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the
limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but
input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a
meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a
Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our
concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable
counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data
sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more
faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline
choices.

Motivation: 现有临床预测模型忽略了临床概念间的语义关系，研究旨在通过整合领域特定的语义信息来改进预测性能。

Method: 从SNOMED分类法构建临床知识图谱，使用黎曼随机梯度下降生成Poincaré嵌入，并整合到ResNet和Transformer深度学习架构中。

Result: 预训练Poincaré嵌入相比随机初始化的欧几里得嵌入在区分性能上有适度但一致的改进，ResNet模型在校准方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 将临床知识图谱嵌入双曲空间并整合到深度学习模型中，可以通过保留临床术语的层次结构来改善肺癌预测。

Abstract: Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data
using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical
concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping
the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using
Poincar\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.
  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived
a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\'e
embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were
then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a
Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute
difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.
  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\'e embeddings resulted in modest
and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline
models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models,
particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\'e embedding, showed enhanced
calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across
configurations.
  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and
integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung
cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical
terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method
for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical
knowledge.

Conclusion: ELATE有效自动化了时间序列特征工程，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine
learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed
to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often
manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive
enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific
insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated
Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an
evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data.
ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics
to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new,
contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that
ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various
domains.

Conclusion: AFABench填补了AFA领域基准测试的空白，有助于系统评估和比较不同方法，推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can
be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns.
Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically
selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading
predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have
been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to
non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of
these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this
paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our
benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports
a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that
enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate
representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy,
and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities
of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed
to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key
trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for
future research. The benchmark code is available at:

Motivation: 现有的SMILES扩散模型仅支持单模态约束，需要为每种新约束重新训练模型。现实应用中需要处理多模态约束且可能动态增加新约束，因此需要开发能够灵活扩展的跨模态分子生成方法。

Method: 基于预训练扩散模型，引入两个可训练模块：结构控制模块(SCM)和性质控制模块(PCM)。生成过程分为两阶段：第一阶段使用SCM在早期扩散步骤中注入结构约束，第二阶段使用PCM在后期推理中精调分子以满足化学性质目标。

Conclusion: CMCM-DLM提供了一种无需重新训练即可扩展预训练模型支持跨模态约束的有效方法，为分子生成领域提供了重要的技术突破。

Abstract: Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically
support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start
of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch
whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve
multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints
may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a
pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but
also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we
propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion
Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:
molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure
Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two
distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM
to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively
anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further
introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated
molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.
Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement
in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

Conclusion: EdgeFD方法提高了联邦蒸馏的效率和实用性，特别适合资源受限的边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine
learning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced
communication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model
outputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing
methods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require
clients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally
expensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side
filtering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address
these challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that
reduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes
the need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based
density ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality
of knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,
including strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,
without requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge
distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID
scenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The
significantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing
the scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation. The
code is available online for reproducibility.

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which
motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the
performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the
lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and
ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To
address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis
for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can
generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive
learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph
augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the
node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach,
named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA),
that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to
improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets.
The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the
other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

Result: 预测方法虽然能达到竞争性性能，但相比在标准方法上投入更多资源并不是帕累托最优，因为它需要完全观测的学习曲线作为训练数据。

Conclusion: 预测方法有潜力但受限于训练数据需求，可以利用现有学习曲线数据来缓解这一缺点。

Abstract: Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization
which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However,
the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make
resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow
starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate
whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on
Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a
large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures
and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the
standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show
that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is
not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard
approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data.
However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve
data.

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges
evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive
representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges:
effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph
information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph
Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We
design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize
node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through
theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by
extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing
both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function
via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization.
GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets;
they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting,
with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

Conclusion: 建模用户行为动态对于效用优化的排序是有效的，RewardRank框架能够更好地捕捉真实用户偏好

Abstract: Traditional ranking systems rely on proxy loss functions that assume
simplistic user behavior, such as users preferring a rank list where items are
sorted by hand-crafted relevance. However, real-world user interactions are
influenced by complex behavioral biases, including position bias, brand
affinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, which these objectives fail
to capture. As a result, models trained on such losses often misalign with
actual user utility, such as the probability of any click or purchase across
the ranked list. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for modeling
user behavior through counterfactual reward learning. Our method, RewardRank,
first trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item
permutations using logged data. Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize
predicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling
end-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To
address the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen
permutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\textit{KD-Eval}$,
using a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii)
$\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language
models. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the
Amazon KDD Cup datasets, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
strong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling user behavior
dynamics for utility-optimized ranking. Our code is available at:

there is a random $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ with $\tilde
O(\log(d)/\epsilon)$ non-zeros per column such that for any
$A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, with high probability,
$(1-\epsilon)\|Ax\|\leq\|\Pi Ax\|\leq(1+\epsilon)\|Ax\|$ for all
$x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides only sub-polylogarithmic
factors in $d$. Our result in particular implies a new fastest sub-current
matrix multiplication time reduction of size $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ for a
broad class of $n\times d$ linear regression tasks.
  A key novelty in our analysis is a matrix concentration technique we call
iterative decoupling, which we use to fine-tune the higher-order trace moment

Abstract: Score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) have proven effective in critical
applications such as drug discovery and protein synthesis. However, their
theoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains
underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are
governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a
system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are
governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing
convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present
the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the
convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph
generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)
graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation
of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique
factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph
structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer
theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling
steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to
improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a
controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align
with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical
understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,
and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.

Motivation: 学生辍学是全球教育系统面临的重大挑战，传统机器学习模型在表格数据上已有不错表现，但图神经网络(GNNs)可能通过捕捉学生数据中的复杂关系来提供优势

Method: 将表格学生数据转换为图结构（主要使用聚类技术），比较GNNs（GCN和GraphSAGE）与表格模型（随机森林、XGBoost、TabNet）的性能，探索基于不同聚类算法（K-Means、HDBSCAN）和降维技术（PCA、UMAP）的图构建策略

Conclusion: GNNs在辍学预测中具有潜力，但图生成策略和GNN架构选择至关重要，突显了将表格数据最优转换为图结构用于图学习的挑战

Abstract: Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide,
leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk
of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning
(ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent
in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether
transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using
clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the
performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE)
on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest
(RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments
explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering
algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques
(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,
GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior
performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage
points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular
baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction
methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical
role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This
highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally
transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.

Abstract: This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism
that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our
method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to
identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search
process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used
to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph
Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees
and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the
decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the
problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph
structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding
local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then
applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates
both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements
across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants,
including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time
Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000
customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been validated as an effective technique for
detecting Parkinson's disease,particularly in its early stages.However,the high
cost of EEG data annotation often results in limited dataset size and
considerable discrepancies across datasets,including differences in acquisition
protocols and subject demographics,significantly hinder the robustness and
generalizability of models in cross-dataset detection scenarios.To address such
challenges,this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework named
MCLPD,which integrates multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight
supervised fine-tuning to enhance cross-dataset PD detection performance.During
pre-training,MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on the unlabeled UNM
dataset.To build contrastive pairs,it applies dual augmentations in both time
and frequency domains,which enrich the data and naturally fuse time-frequency
information.In the fine-tuning phase,only a small proportion of labeled data
from another two datasets (UI and UC)is used for supervised
optimization.Experimental results show that MCLPD achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on
UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1%of labeled data,which further improve to 0.97
and 0.87,respectively,when 5%of labeled data is used.Compared to existing
methods,MCLPD substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while
reducing the dependency on labeled data,demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Abstract: This research introduces a new ML framework designed to enhance the
robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting, specifically
addressing multivariate time series analysis. The proposed methodology
integrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived
from reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for
rigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve
(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the
efficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).
All the models achieved "out-of-sample" production forecasts for an upcoming
future timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using
traditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and
Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing
capabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input
dimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The
uncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a
distribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,
95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a
distinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for
complex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the
LSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample
forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well
E1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining
domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the
reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts.

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal
for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

Abstract: We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for
discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale
closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations
through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical
parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter
enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries;
memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and
ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model
identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable
recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered
Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} =
0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$,
corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This
represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data
without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and
demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The
framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate
coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling
methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.

Conclusion: CoBAD能够有效检测集体移动行为中的异常，特别是之前被忽视的缺失异常类型

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as
public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods
primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at
home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in
collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home
alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.
Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling
spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional
complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to
capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first
formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences
(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event
sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention
mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions
across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior
data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to
detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies
and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior
work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that
CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving
an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR. All source code is

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian
rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness
and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the
environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and
must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such
as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample
complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines
(pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and
reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable,
expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of
exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our
experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition
during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and
effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous
physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly
improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing
essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering
industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves
complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions
that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to
test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without
accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes
on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have
been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies
often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations,
this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive
sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The
framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable
Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement
learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case
study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed
method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its
robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable
step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform
patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching
prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the
expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent
advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more
flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data
faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited
data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an
occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the
underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite
flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which
is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving
generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show
consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring,
yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams
is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized
counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring
what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of
lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data
from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a
temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive
relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological
changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered
relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a
counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical
interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via
one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and
impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy
(e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility
(median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant
inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes,
showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides
a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on
individual responses to lifestyle changes.

Conclusion: 动态拓扑和非均匀聚合策略在分布式SGD中具有重要价值，提出的统一框架为这类算法提供了理论基础

Abstract: One of the most common methods to train machine learning algorithms today is
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In a distributed setting, SGD-based
algorithms have been shown to converge theoretically under specific
circumstances. A substantial number of works in the distributed SGD setting
assume a fixed topology for the edge devices. These papers also assume that the
contribution of nodes to the global model is uniform. However, experiments have
shown that such assumptions are suboptimal and a non uniform aggregation
strategy coupled with a dynamically shifting topology and client selection can
significantly improve the performance of such models. This paper details a
unified framework that covers several Local-Update SGD-based distributed
algorithms with dynamic topologies and provides improved or matching
theoretical guarantees on convergence compared to existing work.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain
fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building
applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy
sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for
conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected
energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of
individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To
address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning
framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and
injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and
sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,
DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the
aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state
recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of
DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that
include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent
performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional
methods.

Motivation: 相似性选择数据在信息检索和嵌入学习等场景中很常见，但经典的基于度量的模型假设IIA，而IIA违反现象在相似性选择领域缺乏系统研究

Method: 提出了两种IIA检验方法：经典的拟合优度检验和基于后验预测检查（PPC）的贝叶斯方法，并构建了两个数据集（一个专门设计用于引发IIA违反，另一个随机生成）

Result: 在两个数据集上都发现了显著的IIA违反，且违反程度相当；PPC检验显示群体同质性，说明IIA违反是由选择集内的情境效应驱动

Conclusion: 相似性选择中存在显著的IIA违反现象，需要开发能够考虑情境效应的新模型

Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives
based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information
retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of
similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a
property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been
detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has
received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the
choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for
IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the
framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our
main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its
mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to
elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the
same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both
datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.
Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that
the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are
driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets.
These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account
for such context effects.

Abstract: In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections
while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to
heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques
fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the
spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships
between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual
environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral
domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral
distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that
the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low
to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral
neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection
on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into
homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently,
various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented
graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and
input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with
real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.

Abstract: Voice biomarkers--human-generated acoustic signals such as speech, coughing,
and breathing--are promising tools for scalable, non-invasive detection and
monitoring of mental health and neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, their clinical
adoption remains constrained by inconsistent quality and limited usability of
publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we present the first
systematic FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) evaluation of
27 publicly available voice biomarker datasets focused on these disease areas.
Using the FAIR Data Maturity Model and a structured, priority-weighted scoring
method, we assessed FAIRness at subprinciple, principle, and composite levels.
Our analysis revealed consistently high Findability but substantial variability
and weaknesses in Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Mental
health datasets exhibited greater variability in FAIR scores, while
neurodegenerative datasets were slightly more consistent. Repository choice
also significantly influenced FAIRness scores. To enhance dataset quality and
clinical utility, we recommend adopting structured, domain-specific metadata
standards, prioritizing FAIR-compliant repositories, and routinely applying
structured FAIR evaluation frameworks. These findings provide actionable
guidance to improve dataset interoperability and reuse, thereby accelerating
the clinical translation of voice biomarker technologies.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the robustness of classical deep hedging strategies
under distributional shifts by leveraging the concept of adversarial attacks.
We first demonstrate that standard deep hedging models are highly vulnerable to
small perturbations in the input distribution, resulting in significant
performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose an adversarial training
framework tailored to increase the robustness of deep hedging strategies. Our
approach extends pointwise adversarial attacks to the distributional setting
and introduces a computationally tractable reformulation of the adversarial
optimization problem over a Wasserstein ball. This enables the efficient
training of hedging strategies that are resilient to distributional
perturbations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that
adversarially trained deep hedging strategies consistently outperform their
classical counterparts in terms of out-of-sample performance and resilience to
model misspecification. Our findings establish a practical and effective
framework for robust deep hedging under realistic market uncertainties.

Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset,
often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity
in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various
interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline,
moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform
well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an
approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be
utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS),
if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform
statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep
learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models,
we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for
dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance
among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.

utilizing intelligent methods to study pathological manifestations, aiming to
facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological diseases.The evaluation

Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in
managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly
pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking
spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability
of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing
efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a
smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps,
mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture
parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive
days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require
any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to
provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location
services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to
specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear
Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR),
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was
employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of
Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142
and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an
LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.

Abstract: The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe
traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic
control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network
requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in
practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a
subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to
new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed
model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and
exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of
detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is
applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically
designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow
prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop
detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes
across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited
data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number
of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against
traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a
non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.

Abstract: This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on
the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to
assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the
reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific

uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in
varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution
analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to
their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics

Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban
environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite
signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining
positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven
methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the
grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a
robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where
localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the
neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train
the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to
obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon
location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for
positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a
blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using
Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on
labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our
collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning
accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance
for mobile devices.

Motivation: 现有的网络安全事件响应决策支持框架需要详细的系统模型，但在实际攻击中信息往往不完整或不准确，限制了其实用性。

Method: 提出MOBAL方法：通过贝叶斯学习迭代优化模型推测，将推测模型量化为有限马尔可夫模型，并使用动态规划进行在线响应规划。

Result: 证明了贝叶斯学习相对于信息反馈的渐近一致性，建立了模型不准确性和量化误差的界限，在CAGE-2基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOBAL方法能够有效处理网络安全事件响应中的模型不准确问题，提高了适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when
information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most
decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system
model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In
this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for
incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:
Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture
about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,
which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine
effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite
Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic
programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with
respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on
misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark
show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and
robustness to model misspecification.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many
applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous
driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic
accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention,
as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this
work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal
trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both
physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based
modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual
nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph
attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future
trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from
psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed
ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions --
and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds
state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling
experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle
trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个模糊增强可解释AI框架(FEXAI)，结合模糊逻辑、机器学习和SHAP分析，用于分析连续下降操作(CDO)性能影响因素，实现了90%以上的分类准确率并提取了可解释的模糊规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续下降操作(CDO)具有减少燃油消耗、排放和噪音等优势，但缺乏系统性研究其性能影响因素的方法，且现有轨迹优化方法缺乏航空领域所需的透明度。

Method: 收集1094个航班的29个特征数据，应用机器学习模型和SHAP分析分类CDO遵守水平并排序特征重要性，使用最重要的三个特征构建模糊规则分类器。

Result: 所有模型分类准确率超过90%，识别出平均下降速率、下降段数量和平均航向变化是最重要的CDO性能预测因子，FEXAI提供了可读的模糊规则。

Conclusion: FEXAI方法为运营决策支持提供了新途径，可集成到航空工具中实现实时建议以保持CDO遵守。

Abstract: Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that
avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving
efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental
benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing
CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as
trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where
explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study
addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)
framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive
dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related
features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then
applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by
importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,
were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the
extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification
accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for
operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the
arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in
directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO
performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway
for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to
enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying
operational conditions.

Abstract: Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex
and costly annotation projects remains under-discussed. This is partly due to
the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and
interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific
domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range
widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from
mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper
provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a
focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in
managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts
including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data
availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various
human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation
quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and
frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of
manual annotation projects across various fields.

pool distribution. As player preferences are also quite heterogeneous, contest
personalization is an important tool to match players with contests. This paper
presents a scalable contest recommendation system, powered by a Wide and Deep
Interaction Ranker (WiDIR) at its core. We productionized this system at our

Abstract: The extended Gaussian family is the closure of the Gaussian family obtained
by completing the Gaussian family with the counterpart elements induced by
degenerate covariance or degenerate precision matrices, or a mix of both
degeneracies. The parameter space of the extended Gaussian family forms a

positive semi-definite matrix cones joined at their bases. In this paper, we
study the Hilbert geometry of such an open bounded convex symmetric
positive-definite bicone. We report the closed-form formula for the
corresponding Hilbert metric distance and study exhaustively its invariance
properties. We also touch upon potential applications of this geometry for
dealing with extended Gaussian distributions.

Abstract: Quantifying out-of-sample discrimination performance for time-to-event
outcomes is a fundamental step for model evaluation and selection in the
context of predictive modelling. The concordance index, or C-index, is a widely
used metric for this purpose, particularly with the growing development of
machine learning methods. Beyond differences between proposed C-index
estimators (e.g. Harrell's, Uno's and Antolini's), we demonstrate the existence
of a C-index multiverse among available R and python software, where seemingly
equal implementations can yield different results. This can undermine
reproducibility and complicate fair comparisons across models and studies. Key
variation sources include tie handling and adjustment to censoring.
Additionally, the absence of a standardised approach to summarise risk from
survival distributions, result in another source of variation dependent on
input types. We demonstrate the consequences of the C-index multiverse when
quantifying predictive performance for several survival models (from Cox
proportional hazards to recent deep learning approaches) on publicly available
breast cancer data, and semi-synthetic examples. Our work emphasises the need
for better reporting to improve transparency and reproducibility. This article
aims to be a useful guideline, helping analysts when navigating the multiverse,
providing unified documentation and highlighting potential pitfalls of existing
software. All code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while
remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we
focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start
temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning
models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to
search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine
learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of
experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The
tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the
neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a
gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both
models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural
network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to
suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target.
The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching
alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a
practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining
physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms.
Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the
use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The
approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be
made with limited data.
