We argue that such systems have\npreviously been unable to represent human meaning because they rely on thin\ndescriptions: numerical representations that enforce standardization and\ntherefore strip human activity of the cultural context that gives it meaning.\nBy contrast, scholars in the humanities and qualitative social sciences have\ndeveloped frameworks for representing meaning through thick description: verbal\nrepresentations that accommodate heterogeneity and retain contextual\ninformation needed to represent human meaning. While these methods can\neffectively codify meaning, they are difficult to deploy at scale. However, the\nverbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of (at least partially)\nautomating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, potentially\novercoming this bottleneck. We argue that the problem of rendering human\nmeaning legible is not just about selecting better metrics, but about\ndeveloping new representational formats (based on thick description). We frame\nthis as a crucial direction for the application of generative AI and identify\nfive key challenges: preserving context, maintaining interpretive pluralism,\nintegrating perspectives based on lived experience and critical distance,\ndistinguishing qualitative content from quantitative magnitude, and\nacknowledging meaning as dynamic rather than static. Furthermore, we suggest\nthat thick description has the potential to serve as a unifying framework to\naddress a number of emerging concerns about the difficulties of representing\nculture in (or using) LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs can represent human meaning through thick descriptions, overcoming limitations of thin descriptions in AI systems.

Most existing deep learning-based drug repositioning methods\npredominantly utilize graph-based representations. However, graph-based drug\nrepositioning methods struggle to perform effective inference in cold-start\nscenarios involving novel drugs because of the lack of association information\nwith the diseases. Unlike traditional graph-based approaches, we propose a\nbidirectional behavior learning strategy for drug repositioning, known as\nBiBLDR. This innovative framework redefines drug repositioning as a behavior\nsequential learning task to capture drug-disease interaction patterns. First,\nwe construct bidirectional behavioral sequences based on drug and disease\nsides. The consideration of bidirectional information ensures a more meticulous\nand rigorous characterization of the behavioral sequences. Subsequently, we\npropose a two-stage strategy for drug repositioning. In the first stage, we\nconstruct prototype spaces to characterize the representational attributes of\ndrugs and diseases. In the second stage, these refined prototypes and\nbidirectional behavior sequence data are leveraged to predict potential\ndrug-disease associations. Based on this learning approach, the model can more\nrobustly and precisely capture the interactive relationships between drug and\ndisease features from bidirectional behavioral sequences.

A\ncritical aspect of human learning is continuous interaction with the\nenvironment -- not limited to language, but also involving multimodal\nunderstanding and generation. To move closer to human-level intelligence,\nmodels must similarly support multi-turn, multimodal interaction.

InterMT captures human preferences at\nboth global and local levels into nine sub-dimensions, consists of 15.6k\nprompts, 52.6k multi-turn dialogue instances, and 32.4k human-labeled\npreference pairs.

In\nthis study, we focus on evaluating and mitigating social bias on both the\nmodel's response and probability distribution. To do so, we first evaluate four\nstate-of-the-art VLMs on PAIRS and SocialCounterfactuals datasets with the\nmultiple-choice selection task. Surprisingly, we find that models suffer from\ngenerating gender-biased or race-biased responses. We also observe that models\nare prone to stating their responses are fair, but indeed having mis-calibrated\nconfidence levels towards particular social groups. While investigating why\nVLMs are unfair in this study, we observe that VLMs' hidden layers exhibit\nsubstantial fluctuations in fairness levels. Meanwhile, residuals in each layer\nshow mixed effects on fairness, with some contributing positively while some\nlead to increased bias.

However, the complex and sparse nature of observational data,\nparticularly information about the bed topography under the ice sheet,\nsignificantly increases the uncertainty in model projections. Bed topography is\ntraditionally measured by airborne ice-penetrating radar that measures the ice\nthickness directly underneath the aircraft, leaving data gap of tens of\nkilometers in between flight lines. This study introduces a deep learning\nframework, which we call as DeepTopoNet, that integrates radar-derived ice\nthickness observations and BedMachine Greenland data through a novel dynamic\nloss-balancing mechanism. Among all efforts to reconstruct bed topography,\nBedMachine has emerged as one of the most widely used datasets, combining mass\nconservation principles and ice thickness measurements to generate\nhigh-resolution bed elevation estimates. The proposed loss function adaptively\nadjusts the weighting between radar and BedMachine data, ensuring robustness in\nareas with limited radar coverage while leveraging the high spatial resolution\nof BedMachine predictions i.e. bed estimates.

Objective:\nThis study aimed to develop a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model to predict\nCOVID-19 severity using spike protein sequences and associated clinical\nmetadata from South American patients. Methods: We retrieved 9,570 spike\nprotein sequences from the GISAID database, of which 3,467 met inclusion\ncriteria after standardization. The dataset included 2,313 severe and 1,154\nmild cases. A feature engineering pipeline extracted features from sequences,\nwhile demographic and clinical variables were one-hot encoded.

By isolating each layer's gradients and\nmeasuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples by\ncomputing layer-wise influences, we derive data-driven estimates of layer\nimportance. Notably, our method produces task-specific layer importance\nestimates for the same LLM, revealing how layers specialize for different\ntest-time evaluation tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our scores by\nleveraging them for two downstream applications: (a) expert allocation in\nLoRA-MoE architectures and (b) layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM\npruning. Experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that our\nmodel-agnostic, influence-guided allocation leads to consistent gains in task\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faLayerIF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u91cf\u5316LLM\u5404\u5c42\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u6570\u636e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u5404\u5c42\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c42\u95f4\u68af\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5c42\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLayerIF\u5728LoRA-MoE\u67b6\u6784\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u914d\u548cLLM\u526a\u679d\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LayerIF\u4e3aLLM\u5c42\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

A further challenge arises when models trained on one\nfield (source domain) fail to generalize to new fields (target domain) due to\ndomain shifts, such as variations in lighting, camera setups, soil composition,\nand crop growth stages. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this by\nenabling adaptation without target-domain labels, but current UDA methods\nstruggle with occlusions and visual blending between crops and weeds, leading\nto misclassifications in real-world conditions. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce MaskAdapt, a novel approach that enhances segmentation accuracy\nthrough multimodal contextual learning by integrating RGB images with features\nderived from depth data. By computing depth gradients from depth maps, our\nmethod captures spatial transitions that help resolve texture ambiguities.\nThese gradients, through a cross-attention mechanism, refines RGB feature\nrepresentations, resulting in sharper boundary delineation. In addition, we\npropose a geometry-aware masking strategy that applies horizontal, vertical,\nand stochastic masks during training. This encourages the model to focus on the\nbroader spatial context for robust visual recognition.

This fast\nweight, akin to recurrent states in RNNs, stores temporary memories of past\ntokens in the current sequence. Existing TTT methods struggled to show\neffectiveness in handling long-context data, due to their inefficiency on\nmodern GPUs. The TTT layers in many of these approaches operate with extremely\nlow FLOPs utilization (often <5%) because they deliberately apply small online\nminibatch sizes (e.g., updating fast weights every 16 or 64 tokens). Moreover,\na small minibatch implies fine-grained block-wise causal dependencies in the\ndata, unsuitable for data beyond 1D ordered sequences, like sets or\nN-dimensional grids such as images or videos. In contrast, we pursue the\nopposite direction by using an extremely large chunk update, ranging from 2K to\n1M tokens across tasks of varying modalities, which we refer to as Large Chunk\nTest-Time Training (LaCT). It improves hardware utilization by orders of\nmagnitude, and more importantly, facilitates scaling of nonlinear state size\n(up to 40% of model parameters), hence substantially improving state capacity,\nall without requiring cumbersome and error-prone kernel implementations. It\nalso allows easy integration of sophisticated optimizers, e.g. Muon for online\nupdates. We validate our approach across diverse modalities and tasks,\nincluding novel view synthesis with image set, language models, and\nauto-regressive video diffusion. Our approach can scale up to 14B-parameter AR\nvideo diffusion model on sequences up to 56K tokens. In our longest sequence\nexperiment, we perform novel view synthesis with 1 million context length.

In this work, we systematically investigate the\ndynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc\n1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and Self\nReference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as a\nwarm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-start\nRL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasingly\ndifficult.

Additionally, we demonstrate through\nexperiments on distilled data that RL training is largely unaffected by the\ncorrectness of long CoT sequences, suggesting that RL prioritizes structural\npatterns over content correctness.

However, despite their growing impact, the vulnerability of\nthese models to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work,\nwe present the first systematic investigation into the security of pathology\nfoundation models for whole slide image~(WSI) analysis against adversarial\nattacks. Specifically, we introduce the principle of \\textit{local perturbation\nwith global impact} and propose a label-free attack framework that operates\nwithout requiring access to downstream task labels. Under this attack\nframework, we revise four classical white-box attack methods and redefine the\nperturbation budget based on the characteristics of WSI. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on three representative pathology foundation models\nacross five datasets and six downstream tasks. Despite modifying only 0.1\\% of\npatches per slide with imperceptible noise, our attack leads to downstream\naccuracy degradation that can reach up to 20\\% in the worst cases. Furthermore,\nwe analyze key factors that influence attack success, explore the relationship\nbetween patch-level vulnerability and semantic content, and conduct a\npreliminary investigation into potential defence strategies.

These systems are described as intelligent and\nthere has been a great deal of talk about the rapid increase in artificial\nintelligence and its potential dangers. However, our theoretical understanding\nof intelligence and ability to measure it lag far behind our capacity for\nbuilding systems that mimic intelligent human behaviour.

In this paper, we propose\nthreading keyframes with narratives (Nar-KFC), a plug-and-play module to\nfacilitate effective and efficient long video perception.

First, we formulate the keyframe selection\nprocess as an integer quadratic programming problem, jointly optimizing\nquery-relevance and frame-diversity. To avoid its computational complexity, a\ncustomized greedy search strategy is designed as an efficient alternative.\nSecond, to mitigate the temporal discontinuity caused by sparse keyframe\nsampling, we further introduce interleaved textual narratives generated from\nnon-keyframes using off-the-shelf captioners. These narratives are inserted\nbetween keyframes based on their true temporal order, forming a coherent and\ncompact representation.

Building on these promising results,\nmulti-modal large language models (MLLMs) have increasingly adopted MoE\ntechniques. However, existing multi-modal MoE tuning methods typically face two\nkey challenges: expert uniformity and router rigidity. Expert uniformity occurs\nbecause MoE experts are often initialized by simply replicating the FFN\nparameters from LLMs, leading to homogenized expert functions and weakening the\nintended diversification of the MoE architecture. Meanwhile, router rigidity\nstems from the prevalent use of static linear routers for expert selection,\nwhich fail to distinguish between visual and textual tokens, resulting in\nsimilar expert distributions for image and text. To address these limitations,\nwe propose EvoMoE, an innovative MoE tuning framework. EvoMoE introduces a\nmeticulously designed expert initialization strategy that progressively evolves\nmultiple robust experts from a single trainable expert, a process termed expert\nevolution that specifically targets severe expert homogenization. Furthermore,\nwe introduce the Dynamic Token-aware Router (DTR), a novel routing mechanism\nthat allocates input tokens to appropriate experts based on their modality and\nintrinsic token values. This dynamic routing is facilitated by hypernetworks,\nwhich dynamically generate routing weights tailored for each individual token.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that EvoMoE significantly outperforms other\nsparse MLLMs across a variety of multi-modal benchmarks, including MME,\nMMBench, TextVQA, and POPE.

To navigate this tradeoff, McCandlish et al.\n(2018) suggest that a critical batch size (CBS), below which training will not\nsubstantially degrade loss, can be estimated based on the gradient noise scale\nduring training. While their method has been adopted in practice, e.g., when\ntraining GPT-3, strong assumptions are required to justify gradient noise as a\nproxy for the CBS, which makes it unclear whether their approach should be\ntrusted in practice, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we introduce a\nsimple, empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and show how the CBS\nevolves over training. Applying our approach to the OLMo models, we find that\nCBS is near 0 at initialization, increases rapidly at first, and then plateaus\nas training progresses. Furthermore, we find that this trend holds across\ndifferent model sizes (1B and 7B), suggesting CBS from small training runs can\ninform larger-scale training runs.

Unlike conventional\nPrivilege Learning, where ground-truth-derived guidance is typically discarded\nafter training, SIPL empowers the model to leverage its own preliminary outputs\nas pseudo-privileged signals for iterative self-refinement at test time.\nCentral to SIPL is Proxy Fusion, a lightweight module incorporating a learnable\nPrivileged Dictionary.

The Forecaster agent focuses on dynamically\nconstraining and refining the candidate POI space. The Predictor agent\nintegrates this information to generate high-precision predictions. Extensive\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets (NYC, TKY, and CA) demonstrate that\nCoMaPOI achieves state of the art performance, improving all metrics by 5% to\n10% compared to SOTA baselines.

Prior research on\nsycophancy has primarily focused on single-turn factual correctness,\noverlooking the dynamics of real-world interactions. In this work, we introduce\nSYCON Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in\nmulti-turn, free-form conversational settings. Our benchmark measures how\nquickly a model conforms to the user (Turn of Flip) and how frequently it\nshifts its stance under sustained user pressure (Number of Flip). Applying\nSYCON Bench to 17 LLMs across three real-world scenarios, we find that\nsycophancy remains a prevalent failure mode.

However, the success of GNNs relies on abundant labeled data, while\nobtaining high-quality labels is costly and challenging, especially for newly\nemerging domains. Hence, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which trains a\nclassifier on the labeled source graph and adapts it to the unlabeled target\ngraph, is attracting increasing attention. Various approaches have been\nproposed to alleviate the distribution shift between the source and target\ngraphs to facilitate the classifier adaptation. However, most of them simply\nadopt existing UDA techniques developed for independent and identically\ndistributed data to gain domain-invariant node embeddings for graphs, which do\nnot fully consider the graph structure and message-passing mechanism of GNNs\nduring the adaptation and will fail when label distribution shift exists among\ndomains. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework that adopts link\nprediction to connect nodes between source and target graphs, which can\nfacilitate message-passing between the source and target graphs and augment the\ntarget nodes to have ``in-distribution'' neighborhoods with the source domain.\nThis strategy modified the target graph on the input level to reduce its\ndeviation from the source domain in the embedding space and is insensitive to\ndisproportional label distributions across domains. To prevent the loss of\ndiscriminative information in the target graph, we further design a novel\nidentity-preserving learning objective, which guides the learning of the edge\ninsertion module together with reconstruction and adaptation losses.\nExperimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u8fde\u63a5\u6e90\u56fe\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u7684\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u7684\u5224\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNNs\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff08UDA\uff09\u4e2d\u56e0\u5ffd\u7565\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u8fde\u63a5\u6e90\u56fe\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u7684\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5224\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3002", "relevance": 40.0}}

While few-shot prompting enables efficient\ninference with limited labeled data, its performance largely depends on the\nquality of selected examples. HED-LM addresses this challenge through a hybrid\nselection pipeline that filters candidate examples based on Euclidean distance\nand re-ranks them using contextual relevance scored by large language models\n(LLMs). To validate its effectiveness, we apply HED-LM to a fatigue detection\ntask using accelerometer data characterized by overlapping patterns and high\ninter-subject variability. Unlike simpler tasks such as activity recognition,\nfatigue detection demands more nuanced example selection due to subtle\ndifferences in physiological signals. Our experiments show that HED-LM achieves\na mean macro F1-score of 69.13$\\pm$10.71%, outperforming both random selection\n(59.30$\\pm$10.13%) and distance-only filtering (67.61$\\pm$11.39%).

Our approach tightly integrates the concept of passage of time, with each\nagent considered as an entity in the PDES framework and responding to prior\nrequests from other agents. Such coupling mechanism enables the agents to work\nin a co-operative environment towards a common goal while many tasks run in\nparallel throughout the simulation. It further enables setting up boundaries to\nthe outputs of the AI agents by applying necessary dynamic constraints using\nnon-AI agents while allowing for scalability through deployment of hundreds of\nsuch agents in a larger compute cluster. Distributing smaller AI agents can\nenable extremely scalable simulations in the future, addressing local memory\nbottlenecks for model parameter storage. Within a PDES involving both AI and\nnon-AI agents, we break down the problem at hand into structured steps, when\nnecessary, providing a set of multiple choices to the AI agents, and then\nprogressively solve these steps towards a final goal. At each step, the non-AI\nagents act as unbiased auditors, verifying each action by the AI agents so that\ncertain rules of engagement are followed. We evaluate our approach by solving\nfour problems from four different domains and comparing the results with those\nfrom AI models alone. Our results show greater accuracy in solving problems\nfrom various domains where the AI models struggle to solve the problems solely\nby themselves.

However, fine-tuning foundation models on one task often\nleads to the issue of concept forgetting on other tasks. Recent methods of\nrobust fine-tuning aim to mitigate forgetting of prior knowledge without\naffecting the fine-tuning performance. Knowledge is often preserved by matching\nthe original and fine-tuned model weights or feature pairs. However, such\npoint-wise matching can be too strong, without explicit awareness of the\nfeature neighborhood structures that encode rich knowledge as well. We propose\na novel regularization method Proxy-FDA that explicitly preserves the\nstructural knowledge in feature space.

In this work, we propose a\nnovel zero-shot 3D HOI generation framework without training on specific\ndatasets, leveraging the knowledge from large-scale pre-trained models.\nSpecifically, the human-object relations are inferred from large language\nmodels (LLMs) to initialize object properties and guide the optimization\nprocess. Then we utilize a pre-trained 2D image diffusion model to parse unseen\nobjects and extract contact points, avoiding the limitations imposed by\nexisting 3D asset knowledge.

Finally, we introduce a detailed optimization to generate\nfine-grained, precise, and natural interaction, enforcing realistic 3D contact\nbetween the 3D object and the involved body parts, including hands in grasping.\nThis is achieved by distilling human-level feedback from LLMs to capture\ndetailed human-object relations from the text instruction.

Despite the impressive denoising performance of RSI denoising\nmethods, most current deep learning-based approaches function as black boxes\nand lack integration with physical information models, leading to limited\ninterpretability. Additionally, many methods may struggle with insufficient\nattention to non-local self-similarity in RSI and require tedious tuning of\nregularization parameters to achieve optimal performance, particularly in\nconventional iterative optimization approaches. In this paper, we first propose\na novel RSI denoising method named sparse tensor-aided representation network\n(STAR-Net), which leverages a low-rank prior to effectively capture the\nnon-local self-similarity within RSI. Furthermore, we extend STAR-Net to a\nsparse variant called STAR-Net-S to deal with the interference caused by\nnon-Gaussian noise in original RSI for the purpose of improving robustness.\nDifferent from conventional iterative optimization, we develop an alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM)-guided deep unrolling network, in which\nall regularization parameters can be automatically learned, thus inheriting the\nadvantages of both model-based and deep learning-based approaches and\nsuccessfully addressing the above-mentioned shortcomings.

The combination of these\nmulti-modal data enhances environmental perception by providing 3D spatial\ncontext, which is absent in standard RGB images. Although RGBD multi-modal data\ncan be available to train computer vision models, accessing all sensor\nmodalities during the inference stage may be infeasible due to sensor failures\nor resource constraints, leading to a mismatch between data modalities\navailable during training and inference. Traditional Cross-Modal Knowledge\nDistillation (CMKD) frameworks, developed to address this task, are typically\nbased on a teacher/student paradigm, where a multi-modal teacher distills\nknowledge into a single-modality student model. However, these approaches face\nchallenges in teacher architecture choices and distillation process selection,\nthus limiting their adoption in real-world scenarios. To overcome these issues,\nwe introduce CroDiNo-KD (Cross-Modal Disentanglement: a New Outlook on\nKnowledge Distillation), a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework\nfor RGBD semantic segmentation.

Overall, our proposed LLM benchmark,\nwhich evaluates fairness with uncertainty awareness, paves the way for\ndeveloping more transparent and accountable AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cfUCerF\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6027\u522b-\u804c\u4e1a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9690\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUCerF\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u6027\u522b-\u804c\u4e1a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0831,756\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5bf910\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "Mistral-7B\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5728UCerF\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982Equalized Odds\uff09\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u3002", "conclusion": "UCerF\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u95ee\u8d23\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Although recent\nmechanistic-interpretability studies have deepened our understanding of the\ninternal behavior of Transformers by analyzing their residual stream, the\nrelationship between these internal mechanisms and the parameter scaling laws\nremains unclear. To bridge this gap, we focus on layers and their size, which\nmainly decide the parameter size of Transformers. For this purpose, we first\ntheoretically investigate the layers within the residual stream through a\nbias-diversity decomposition. The decomposition separates (i) bias, the error\nof each layer's output from the ground truth, and (ii) diversity, which\nindicates how much the outputs of each layer differ from each other. Analyzing\nTransformers under this theory reveals that performance improves when\nindividual layers make predictions close to the correct answer and remain\nmutually diverse. We show that diversity becomes especially critical when\nindividual layers' outputs are far from the ground truth.

Compared with general image classification tasks, FBIC poses\nmore formidable challenges: 1) the differences in species size and imaging\ndistance result in the varying sizes of birds presented in the images; 2)\ncomplex natural habitats often introduce strong background interference; 3) and\nhighly flexible poses such as flying, perching, or foraging result in\nsubstantial intra-class variability. These factors collectively make it\ndifficult for traditional methods to stably extract discriminative features,\nthereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of models in\nreal-world applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nfine-grained bird classification framework based on strip-aware spatial\nperception, which aims to capture long-range spatial dependencies across entire\nrows or columns in bird images, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and\ninterpretability. The proposed method incorporates two novel modules:\nextensional perception aggregator (EPA) and channel semantic weaving (CSW).\nSpecifically, EPA integrates local texture details with global structural cues\nby aggregating information across horizontal and vertical spatial directions.\nCSW further refines the semantic representations by adaptively fusing\nlong-range and short-range information along the channel dimension.

Despite a recent surge of new methods\ndeveloped in this space, the impact of hyperparameter tuning in these methods\nremains under-explored. In this work, we present the first large-scale\nempirical study to understand the hyperparameter sensitivity of common data\nattribution methods. Our results show that most methods are indeed sensitive to\ncertain key hyperparameters. However, unlike typical machine learning\nalgorithms -- whose hyperparameters can be tuned using computationally-cheap\nvalidation metrics -- evaluating data attribution performance often requires\nretraining models on subsets of training data, making such metrics\nprohibitively costly for hyperparameter tuning. This poses a critical open\nchallenge for the practical application of data attribution methods. To address\nthis challenge, we advocate for better theoretical understandings of\nhyperparameter behavior to inform efficient tuning strategies. As a case study,\nwe provide a theoretical analysis of the regularization term that is critical\nin many variants of influence function methods. Building on this analysis, we\npropose a lightweight procedure for selecting the regularization value without\nmodel retraining, and validate its effectiveness across a range of standard\ndata attribution benchmarks.

The outliers are treated as noise, considerably degrading\nthe performance of SSL models. To address this drawback, we propose a novel\nframework, Diversify and Conquer (DAC), to enhance SSL robustness in the\ncontext of open-set semi-supervised learning. In particular, we note that\nexisting open-set SSL methods rely on prediction discrepancies between inliers\nand outliers from a single model trained on labeled data. This approach can be\neasily failed when the labeled data is insufficient, leading to performance\ndegradation that is worse than naive SSL that do not account for outliers. In\ncontrast, our approach exploits prediction disagreements among multiple models\nthat are differently biased towards the unlabeled distribution. By leveraging\nthe discrepancies arising from training on unlabeled data, our method enables\nrobust outlier detection even when the labeled data is underspecified.

Effective RL for LLMs\nrequires massive parallelization and poses an urgent need for efficient\ntraining systems. Most existing large-scale RL systems for LLMs are synchronous\nby alternating generation and training in a batch setting, where the rollouts\nin each training batch are generated by the same (or latest) model. This\nstabilizes RL training but suffers from severe system-level inefficiency.\nGeneration must wait until the longest output in the batch is completed before\nmodel update, resulting in GPU underutilization. We present AReaL, a\n\\emph{fully asynchronous} RL system that completely decouples generation from\ntraining. Rollout workers in AReaL continuously generate new outputs without\nwaiting, while training workers update the model whenever a batch of data is\ncollected. AReaL also incorporates a collection of system-level optimizations,\nleading to substantially higher GPU utilization. To stabilize RL training,\nAReaL balances the workload of rollout and training workers to control data\nstaleness, and adopts a staleness-enhanced PPO variant to better handle\noutdated training samples. Extensive experiments on math and code reasoning\nbenchmarks show that AReaL achieves \\textbf{up to 2.57$\\times$ training\nspeedup} compared to the best synchronous systems with the same number of GPUs\nand matched or even improved final performance.

Recent studies attribute this\nperformance gain to the prediction misfit between the student and teacher\nmodels. In this work, we theoretically investigate the emergence of W2SG\nthrough a generalized bias-variance decomposition of Bregman divergence.\nSpecifically, we show that the expected population risk gap between the student\nand teacher is quantified by the expected misfit between the two models. While\nthis aligns with previous results, our analysis removes several restrictive\nassumptions, most notably, the convexity of the student's hypothesis class,\nrequired in earlier works. Moreover, we show that W2SG is more likely to emerge\nwhen the student model approximates its posterior mean teacher, rather than\nmimicking an individual teacher. Using a concrete example, we demonstrate that\nif the student model has significantly larger capacity than the teacher, it can\nindeed converge to this posterior mean. Our analysis also suggests that\navoiding overfitting to the teacher's supervision and reducing the entropy of\nstudent's prediction further facilitate W2SG. In addition, we show that the\nreverse cross-entropy loss, unlike the standard forward cross-entropy, is less\nsensitive to the predictive uncertainty of the teacher.

Specifically, we develop a dynamic\nprogramming algorithm that optimizes the layer-skipping process by leveraging\nthe complete hidden states from the last verification stage as an objective.\nThis enables CLaSp to dynamically adjust its layer-skipping strategy after each\nverification stage, without relying on pre-optimized sets of skipped layers.\nExperimental results across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that CLaSp\nachieves a speedup of 1.3x ~ 1.7x on LLaMA3 series models without altering the\noriginal distribution of the generated text.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLaSp\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u81ea\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8df3\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u52a0\u901fLLM\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.3x~1.7x\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5dee\uff0cCLaSp\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u8df3\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaMA3\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b01.3x~1.7x\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "CLaSp\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

To solve these problems,\nwe propose ERU-KG, an unsupervised keyphrase generation (UKG) model that\nconsists of an informativeness and a phraseness module. The former estimates\nthe relevance of keyphrase candidates, while the latter generate those\ncandidates. The informativeness module innovates by learning to model\ninformativeness through references (e.g., queries, citation contexts, and\ntitles) and at the term-level, thereby 1) capturing how the key concepts of\ndocuments are perceived in different contexts and 2) estimating informativeness\nof phrases more efficiently by aggregating term informativeness, removing the\nneed for explicit modeling of the candidates. ERU-KG demonstrates its\neffectiveness on keyphrase generation benchmarks by outperforming unsupervised\nbaselines and achieving on average 89\\% of the performance of a supervised\nmodel for top 10 predictions. Additionally, to highlight its practical utility,\nwe evaluate the model on text retrieval tasks and show that keyphrases\ngenerated by ERU-KG are effective when employed as query and document\nexpansions. Furthermore, inference speed tests reveal that ERU-KG is the\nfastest among baselines of similar model sizes. Finally, our proposed model can\nswitch between keyphrase generation and extraction by adjusting\nhyperparameters, catering to diverse application requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "ERU-KG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u548c\u77ed\u8bed\u6027\u6a21\u5757\u6539\u8fdb\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "ERU-KG\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u8003\u548c\u672f\u8bed\u7ea7\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\u548c\u77ed\u8bed\u6027\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b89%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6700\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "ERU-KG\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "relevance": 40.0}}

In this paper, we propose the\nalgorithm LightSAM which sets the perturbation radius and learning rate of SAM\nadaptively, thus extending the application scope of SAM. LightSAM employs three\npopular adaptive optimizers, including AdaGrad-Norm, AdaGrad and Adam, to\nreplace the SGD optimizer for weight perturbation and model updating, reducing\nsensitivity to parameters. Theoretical results show that under weak\nassumptions, LightSAM could converge ideally with any choices of perturbation\nradius and learning rate, thus achieving parameter-agnostic. We conduct\npreliminary experiments on several deep learning tasks, which together with the\ntheoretical findings validate the the effectiveness of LightSAM.", "AI": {"tldr": "LightSAM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Sharpness-Aware Minimization\uff08SAM\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6270\u52a8\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86SAM\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1SAM\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002LightSAM\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "LightSAM\u91c7\u7528AdaGrad-Norm\u3001AdaGrad\u548cAdam\u7b49\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3SGD\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6270\u52a8\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cLightSAM\u5728\u5f31\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u60f3\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "LightSAM\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u65e0\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SAM\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "relevance": 40.0}}

We propose\nan efficient implementation of the weighted convolution by pre-computing the\ndensity function and achieving execution times comparable to standard\nconvolution layers. We evaluate our method on two deep learning tasks: image\nclassification using the CIFAR-100 dataset [KH+09] and image denoising using\nthe DIV2K dataset [AT17]. Experimental results with state-of-the-art\nclassification (e.g., VGG [SZ15], ResNet [HZRS16]) and denoising (e.g., DnCNN\n[ZZC+17], NAFNet [CCZS22]) methods show that the weighted convolution improves\nperformance with respect to standard convolution across different quantitative\nmetrics. For example, VGG achieves an accuracy of 66.94% with weighted\nconvolution versus 56.89% with standard convolution on the classification\nproblem, while DnCNN improves the PSNR value from 20.17 to 22.63 on the\ndenoising problem. All models were trained on the CINECA Leonardo cluster to\nreduce the execution time and improve the tuning of the density function\nvalues.

In the Baidu Search AI assistant, an industrial-scale\nmulti-turn search system, we propose a novel two-phase framework to provide\nproactive guidance. The first phase, Goal-adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning\n(G-SFT), employs a goal adaptation agent that dynamically adapts to user goal\nshifts and provides goal-relevant contextual information. G-SFT also\nincorporates scalable knowledge transfer to distill insights from LLMs into a\nlightweight model for real-time interaction. The second phase, Click-oriented\nReinforcement Learning (C-RL), adopts a generate-rank paradigm, systematically\nconstructs preference pairs from user click signals, and proactively improves\nclick-through rates through more engaging guidance. This dual-phase\narchitecture achieves complementary objectives: G-SFT ensures accurate goal\ntracking, while C-RL optimizes interaction quality through click signal-driven\nreinforcement learning.

However, TPs require translating natural language into\nmachine-verifiable formal representations, a process that introduces the risk\nof semantic information loss and unfaithful interpretation, an issue compounded\nby LLMs' challenges in capturing critical logical structures with sufficient\nprecision. Moreover, LLMs are still limited in their capacity for rigorous and\nrobust proof construction within formal verification frameworks. To mitigate\nissues related to faithfulness and robustness, this paper investigates\nstrategies to (1) alleviate semantic loss during autoformalisation, (2)\nefficiently identify and correct syntactic errors in logical representations,\n(3) explicitly use logical expressions to guide LLMs in generating structured\nproof sketches, and (4) increase LLMs' capacity of interpreting TP's feedback\nfor iterative refinement. Our empirical results on e-SNLI, QASC and WorldTree\nusing different LLMs demonstrate that the proposed strategies yield significant\nimprovements in autoformalisation (+18.46%, +34.2%, +39.77%) and explanation\nrefinement (+29.5%, +51.5%, +41.25%) over the state-of-the-art model.

The laborious\nand costly process of FACS coding has motivated the development of machine\nlearning frameworks for Action Unit (AU) detection. Despite intense efforts\nspanning three decades, the detection accuracy for many AUs is considered to be\nbelow the threshold needed for behavioral research. Also, many AUs are excluded\naltogether, making it impossible to fulfill the ultimate goal of FACS-the\nrepresentation of any facial expression in its entirety. This paper considers\nan alternative approach. Instead of creating automated tools that mimic FACS\nexperts, we propose to use a new coding system that mimics the key properties\nof FACS. Specifically, we construct a data-driven coding system called the\nFacial Basis, which contains units that correspond to localized and\ninterpretable 3D facial movements, and overcomes three structural limitations\nof automated FACS coding. First, the proposed method is completely\nunsupervised, bypassing costly, laborious and variable manual annotation.\nSecond, Facial Basis reconstructs all observable movement, rather than relying\non a limited repertoire of recognizable movements (as in automated FACS).\nFinally, the Facial Basis units are additive, whereas AUs may fail detection\nwhen they appear in a non-additive combination. The proposed method outperforms\nthe most frequently used AU detector in predicting autism diagnosis from\nin-person and remote conversations, highlighting the importance of encoding\nfacial behavior comprehensively.

Empirical Studies in Time Series Forecasting", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Time series forecasting (TSF) is a fundamental and widely studied task,\nspanning methods from classical statistical approaches to modern deep learning\nand multimodal language modeling.

Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g.,\nChatGPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated impressive multi-step reasoning\ncapabilities across diverse domains, suggesting a new opportunity for reframing\nTSF as a structured reasoning task.

In\ncontrast, a strong BERT-based baseline, which relies solely on the generated\ntokens, performs worse, likely because it depends on shallow linguistic cues\nrather than deeper reasoning dynamics. Surprisingly, using later reasoning\nsteps does not always improve classification. When additional context is\nunhelpful, earlier representations resemble later ones more, suggesting LLMs\nencode key information early. This implies reasoning can often stop early\nwithout loss. To test this, we conduct early stopping experiments, showing that\ntruncating CoT reasoning still improves performance over not using CoT at all,\nthough a gap remains compared to full reasoning. However, approaches like\nsupervised learning or reinforcement learning designed to shorten CoT chains\ncould leverage our classifier's guidance to identify when early stopping is\neffective. Our findings provide insights that may support such methods, helping\nto optimize CoT's efficiency while preserving its benefits.\\footnote{Code and\ndata is available at\n\\href{https://github.com/anum94/CoTpred}{\\texttt{github.com/anum94/CoTpred}}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u8868\u793a\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672cCoT\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u4f55token\u4e4b\u524d\u5c31\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5df2\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u3002BERT\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u90e8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0CoT\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u96f6\u6837\u672cCoT\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6210\u529f\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5b8c\u6210\u524d\u88ab\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u8868\u793a\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548cBERT\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "LLM\u521d\u59cb\u8868\u793a\u5df2\u5305\u542b\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u90e8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0CoT\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316CoT\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5982\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7f29\u77ed\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Detection of\nCRC at early stages is crucial for increasing patient survival rates. However,\ncolonoscopy is dependent on obtaining adequate and high-quality endoscopic\nimages.

Accepted to COMPSAC 2025", "summary": "Automatic code generation has gained significant momentum with the advent of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Although many studies focus on\nimproving the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation, very limited work\ntries to understand the generated code's characteristics and leverage that to\nimprove failed cases. In this paper, as the most straightforward characteristic\nof code, we investigate the relationship between code complexity and the\nsuccess of LLM generated code. Using a large set of standard complexity\nmetrics, we first conduct an empirical analysis to explore their correlation\nwith LLM's performance on code generation (i.e., Pass@1). Using logistic\nregression models, we identify which complexity metrics are most predictive of\ncode correctness. Building on these findings, we propose an iterative feedback\nmethod, where LLMs are prompted to generate correct code based on complexity\nmetrics from previous failed outputs. We validate our approach across multiple\nbenchmarks (i.e., HumanEval, MBPP, LeetCode, and BigCodeBench) and various LLMs\n(i.e., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and GPT-o3 mini), comparing the\nresults with two baseline methods: (a) zero-shot generation, and (b) iterative\nexecution-based feedback without our code complexity insights.

Deep learning methods have shown promising results in segmenting\nhistorical maps, but publicly available datasets typically focus on a single\nmap type or period, require extensive and costly annotations, and are not\nsuited for nationwide, long-term analyses. In this paper, we introduce a new\ndataset of historical maps tailored for analyzing large-scale, long-term land\nuse and land cover evolution with limited annotations. Spanning metropolitan\nFrance (548,305 km^2), our dataset contains three map collections from the\n18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. We provide both comprehensive modern labels and\n22,878 km^2 of manually annotated historical labels for the 18th and 19th\ncentury maps. Our dataset illustrates the complexity of the segmentation task,\nfeaturing stylistic inconsistencies, interpretive ambiguities, and significant\nlandscape changes (e.g., marshlands disappearing in favor of forests). We\nassess the difficulty of these challenges by benchmarking three approaches: a\nfully-supervised model trained with historical labels, and two\nweakly-supervised models that rely only on modern annotations. The latter\neither use the modern labels directly or first perform image-to-image\ntranslation to address the stylistic gap between historical and contemporary\nmaps.

To better\ncapture the relationships between strokes and radicals, we introduce\nMulti-Granularity Fusion Modules on the image and text sides, respectively.\nFurthermore, to effectively bridge the two modalities, we further introduce a\nFine-Grained Decoupled Image-Text Contrastive loss, which aligns image and text\nrepresentations across multiple granularities.

Unlike optimization-based approaches that require costly bi-level\noptimization, distribution matching (DM) methods improve efficiency by aligning\nthe distributions of synthetic and original data, thereby eliminating nested\noptimization. DM achieves high computational efficiency and has emerged as a\npromising solution. However, existing DM methods, constrained to Euclidean\nspace, treat data as independent and identically distributed points,\noverlooking complex geometric and hierarchical relationships. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a novel hyperbolic dataset distillation method, termed\nHDD. Hyperbolic space, characterized by negative curvature and exponential\nvolume growth with distance, naturally models hierarchical and tree-like\nstructures. HDD embeds features extracted by a shallow network into the Lorentz\nhyperbolic space, where the discrepancy between synthetic and original data is\nmeasured by the hyperbolic (geodesic) distance between their centroids. By\noptimizing this distance, the hierarchical structure is explicitly integrated\ninto the distillation process, guiding synthetic samples to gravitate towards\nthe root-centric regions of the original data distribution while preserving\ntheir underlying geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we find that pruning\nin hyperbolic space requires only 20% of the distilled core set to retain model\nperformance, while significantly improving training stability.

However, the reasoning capabilities of\nmultimodal LLMs (MLLMs) still significantly lag, especially for complex\nvideo-language tasks. To address this issue, we present SiLVR, a Simple\nLanguage-based Video Reasoning framework that decomposes complex video\nunderstanding into two stages. In the first stage, SiLVR transforms raw video\ninto language-based representations using multisensory inputs, such as short\nclip captions and audio/speech subtitles. In the second stage, language\ndescriptions are fed into a powerful reasoning LLM to solve complex\nvideo-language understanding tasks. To handle long-context multisensory inputs,\nwe use an adaptive token reduction scheme, which dynamically determines the\ntemporal granularity with which to sample the tokens. Our simple, modular, and\ntraining-free video reasoning framework achieves the best-reported results on\nVideo-MME (long), Video-MMMU (comprehension), Video-MMLU, CGBench, and EgoLife.\nFurthermore, our empirical study focused on video reasoning capabilities shows\nthat, despite not being explicitly trained on video, strong reasoning LLMs can\neffectively aggregate multisensory input information from video, speech, and\naudio for complex temporal, causal, long-context, and knowledge acquisition\nreasoning tasks in video.

Experiments indicate our\nmethod significantly outperforms current approaches on the jigsaw puzzle\nbenchmark, a common task for permutation learning. However, we argue this\nbenchmark is limited in its ability to assess learning probability\ndistributions, as the target is a delta distribution (i.e., a single correct\nsolution exists).

Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR\nframework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains\ndifferent verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online\nRL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture\nstrategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data\nmixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture.\nComprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when\ncombined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM\ngeneral reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained\nmodel's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24%\ncompared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a\ntotal of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6RLVR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u6a21\u6001RLVR\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53475.24%\uff0c\u603b\u63d0\u534720.74%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\u591a\u9886\u57dfRLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, a lengthy thinking trajectory leads to reduced\nefficiency. Most of the existing methods are stuck in the assumption of\noverthinking and attempt to reason efficiently by compressing the\nChain-of-Thought, but this often leads to performance degradation. To address\nthis problem, we introduce A*-Thought, an efficient tree search-based unified\nframework designed to identify and isolate the most essential thoughts from the\nextensive reasoning chains produced by these models. It formulates the\nreasoning process of LRMs as a search tree, where each node represents a\nreasoning span in the giant reasoning space. By combining the A* search\nalgorithm with a cost function specific to the reasoning path, it can\nefficiently compress the chain of thought and determine a reasoning path with\nhigh information density and low cost. In addition, we also propose a\nbidirectional importance estimation mechanism, which further refines this\nsearch process and enhances its efficiency beyond uniform sampling. Extensive\nexperiments on several advanced math tasks show that A*-Thought effectively\nbalances performance and efficiency over a huge search space.

However, video object removal, a critical subtask of video\nediting, remains challenging due to issues such as hallucinated objects and\nvisual artifacts. Furthermore, existing methods often rely on computationally\nexpensive sampling procedures and classifier-free guidance (CFG), resulting in\nslow inference. To address these limitations, we propose MiniMax-Remover, a\nnovel two-stage video object removal approach. Motivated by the observation\nthat text condition is not best suited for this task, we simplify the\npretrained video generation model by removing textual input and cross-attention\nlayers, resulting in a more lightweight and efficient model architecture in the\nfirst stage. In the second stage, we distilled our remover on successful videos\nproduced by the stage-1 model and curated by human annotators, using a minimax\noptimization strategy to further improve editing quality and inference speed.\nSpecifically, the inner maximization identifies adversarial input noise (\"bad\nnoise\") that makes failure removals, while the outer minimization step trains\nthe model to generate high-quality removal results even under such challenging\nconditions. As a result, our method achieves a state-of-the-art video object\nremoval results with as few as 6 sampling steps and doesn't rely on CFG,\nsignificantly improving inference efficiency.

To address these challenges, inspired by the human cognitive\nprocess, we propose Causal-aware LLMs, which integrate the structural causal\nmodel (SCM) into the decision-making process to model, update, and utilize\nstructured knowledge of the environment in a ``learning-adapting-acting\"\nparadigm.

Finally, in the\nacting stage, Causal-aware LLMs exploit structured causal knowledge for more\nefficient policy-making through the reinforcement learning agent. The above\nprocesses are performed iteratively to learn causal knowledge, ultimately\nenabling the causal-aware LLMs to achieve a more accurate understanding of the\nenvironment and make more efficient decisions.

In this way, model\nsensitivity to perturbations is reduced, and robustness is enhanced since\nmodels in the neighborhood of the flat minimum also enjoy low loss values.

However, its high\nefficiency stems from an approximation of projecting 3D Gaussians onto the\nimage plane as 2D Gaussians, which inherently limits rendering\nquality--particularly under large Field-of-View (FoV) camera inputs. While\nseveral recent works have extended 3DGS to mitigate these approximation errors,\nnone have successfully achieved both exactness and high efficiency\nsimultaneously. In this work, we introduce 3DGEER, an Exact and Efficient\nVolumetric Gaussian Rendering method. Starting from first principles, we derive\na closed-form expression for the density integral along a ray traversing a 3D\nGaussian distribution. This formulation enables precise forward rendering with\narbitrary camera models and supports gradient-based optimization of 3D Gaussian\nparameters. To ensure both exactness and real-time performance, we propose an\nefficient method for computing a tight Particle Bounding Frustum (PBF) for each\n3D Gaussian, enabling accurate and efficient ray-Gaussian association.

A key innovation is its in-depth analysis of solver-internal features --\nparticularly by comparing distributions of key solver outputs including root\nnode gap, heuristic success rates, and cut plane usage -- leveraging the\nsolver's dynamic solution behavior as an `expert assessment' to reveal nuanced\ncomputational resemblances. By offering a structured approach with clearly\ndefined solver-independent and solver-dependent metrics, our benchmark aims to\nfacilitate robust comparisons among diverse generation techniques, spur the\ndevelopment of higher-quality instance generators, and ultimately enhance the\nreliability of research reliant on synthetic MILP data. The framework's\neffectiveness in systematically comparing the fidelity of instance sets is\ndemonstrated using contemporary generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08MILP\uff09\u5b9e\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6570\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u786c\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0cMILP\u5b9e\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6ede\u540e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u786c\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u6839\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u9699\u3001\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u5207\u5272\u5e73\u9762\u4f7f\u7528\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f53\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b9e\u4f8b\u96c6\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5b9e\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210MILP\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

Image registration, a\nfoundational task in neuroimaging pipelines, has similarly benefited from the\nLearn2Reg initiative. Building on this foundation, we introduce the Large-scale\nUnsupervised Brain MRI Image Registration (LUMIR) challenge, a next-generation\nbenchmark designed to assess and advance unsupervised brain MRI registration.\nDistinct from prior challenges that leveraged anatomical label maps for\nsupervision, LUMIR removes this dependency by providing over 4,000 preprocessed\nT1-weighted brain MRIs for training without any label maps, encouraging\nbiologically plausible deformation modeling through self-supervision. In\naddition to evaluating performance on 590 held-out test subjects, LUMIR\nintroduces a rigorous suite of zero-shot generalization tasks, spanning\nout-of-domain imaging modalities (e.g., FLAIR, T2-weighted, T2*-weighted),\ndisease populations (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), acquisition protocols (e.g.,\n9.4T MRI), and species (e.g., macaque brains). A total of 1,158 subjects and\nover 4,000 image pairs were included for evaluation.

Recent advancements utilize autoregressive modeling, significantly\nenhancing expressive power and generation quality. However, such sequential\nmodeling inherently restricts parallel computation during inference, leading to\nslow generation that impedes practical deployment. In this paper, we first\nidentify that strict sequential dependency in inference is unnecessary to\ngenerate high-quality samples.

Moreover, the models tend to exhibit low dependency redundancy in the\ninitial layer and higher redundancy in subsequent layers.

We propose\ntwo propagation modes: Untargeted Propagation, where bias affects multiple\ntasks, and Targeted Propagation, focusing on specific tasks while maintaining\nnormal behavior elsewhere. With only 25 poisoned samples (0.25% poisoning\nrate), student models generate biased responses 76.9% of the time in targeted\nscenarios - higher than 69.4% in teacher models. For untargeted propagation,\nadversarial bias appears 6x-29x more frequently in student models on unseen\ntasks.

Although\nPCI typically requires 2D X-ray angiography (XRA) to guide catheter placement\nat real-time, computed tomography angiography (CTA) may substantially improve\nPCI by providing precise information of 3D vascular anatomy and status. To\nleverage real-time XRA and detailed 3D CTA anatomy for PCI, accurate multimodal\nimage registration of XRA and CTA is required, to guide the procedure and avoid\ncomplications. This is a challenging process as it requires registration of\nimages from different geometrical modalities (2D -> 3D and vice versa), with\nvariations in contrast and noise levels. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal coronary artery image registration method based on a swarm\noptimization algorithm, which effectively addresses challenges such as large\ndeformations, low contrast, and noise across these imaging modalities. Our\nalgorithm consists of two main modules: 1) preprocessing of XRA and CTA images\nseparately, and 2) a registration module based on feature extraction using the\nSteger and Superpixel Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms. Our technique was\nevaluated on a pilot dataset of 28 pairs of XRA and CTA images from 10 patients\nwho underwent PCI. The algorithm was compared with four state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods in terms of registration accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.

This paper addresses the\ncritical question: How can both positive and negative distilled reasoning\ntraces be effectively leveraged to maximize LLM reasoning performance in an\noffline setting? To this end, We propose Reinforcement Distillation (REDI), a\ntwo-stage framework. Stage 1 learns from positive traces via Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT). Stage 2 further refines the model using both positive and\nnegative traces through our proposed REDI objective. This novel objective is a\nsimple, reference-free loss function that outperforms established methods like\nDPO and SimPO in this distillation context. Our empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate REDI's superiority over baseline Rejection Sampling SFT or SFT\ncombined with DPO/SimPO on mathematical reasoning tasks. Notably, the\nQwen-REDI-1.5B model, post-trained on just 131k positive and negative examples\nfrom the open Open-R1 dataset, achieves an 83.1% score on MATH-500 (pass@1).\nIts performance matches or surpasses that of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B (a\nmodel post-trained on 800k proprietary data) across various mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B models\npost-trained offline with openly available data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aREDI\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u8d1f\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e22\u5f03\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u8d1f\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "REDI\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u4f8b\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684REDI\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u8d1f\u4f8b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "REDI\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cQwen-REDI-1.5B\u6a21\u578b\u5728MATH-500\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523083.1%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e800k\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "REDI\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u8d1f\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

We tackle this problem by using numerical\ndigital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a\nquantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap.

While\nspatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution have been extensively\nstudied, joint spatio-spectral super-resolution remains relatively explored. We\npropose an end-to-end model-driven framework that explicitly decomposes the\njoint spatio-spectral super-resolution problem into spatial super-resolution,\nspectral super-resolution and fusion tasks. Each sub-task is addressed by\nunfolding a variational-based approach, where the operators involved in the\nproximal gradient iterative scheme are replaced with tailored learnable\nmodules. In particular, we design an upsampling operator for spatial\nsuper-resolution based on classical back-projection algorithms, adapted to\nhandle arbitrary scaling factors. Spectral reconstruction is performed using\nlearnable cluster-based upsampling and downsampling operators. For image\nfusion, we integrate low-frequency estimation and high-frequency injection\nmodules to combine the spatial and spectral information from spatial\nsuper-resolution and spectral super-resolution outputs. Additionally, we\nintroduce an efficient nonlocal post-processing step that leverages image\nself-similarity by combining a multi-head attention mechanism with residual\nconnections.

In scenarios where there is a gap between trace\nevents and reference business activities, this entails an interpretation\nproblem, amounting to translating each event of any ongoing trace into the\ncorresponding step of the activity instance. Building on a recent approach that\nframes the interpretation problem as an acceptance problem within an Abstract\nArgumentation Framework (AAF), one can elegantly analyze plausible event\ninterpretations (possibly in an aggregated form), as well as offer explanations\nfor those that conflict with prior process knowledge. Since, in settings where\nevent-to-activity mapping is highly uncertain (or simply under-specified) this\nreasoning-based approach may yield lowly-informative results and heavy\ncomputation, one can think of discovering a sequencetagging model, trained to\nsuggest highly-probable candidate event interpretations in a context-aware way.\nHowever, training such a model optimally may require using a large amount of\nmanually-annotated example traces.

Current gesture recognition methods are mostly limited to\nshort-range interactions, reducing their utility in scenarios demanding robust\nassistive communication from afar. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach\ndesigned specifically for assistive robotics, enabling dynamic gesture\nrecognition at extended distances of up to 30 meters, thereby significantly\nimproving accessibility and quality of life. Our proposed Distance-aware\nGesture Network (DiG-Net) effectively combines Depth-Conditioned Deformable\nAlignment (DADA) blocks with Spatio-Temporal Graph modules, enabling robust\nprocessing and classification of gesture sequences captured under challenging\nconditions, including significant physical attenuation, reduced resolution, and\ndynamic gesture variations commonly experienced in real-world assistive\nenvironments.

In this work, we\nchallenge prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that prolonged RL (ProRL)\ntraining can uncover novel reasoning strategies that are inaccessible to base\nmodels, even under extensive sampling.

In a mixed-methods\nstudy (n=21), WikiGap significantly improved fact-finding accuracy, reduced\ntask time, and received a 32-point higher usability score relative to\nWikipedia's current ILL-based navigation system.

In this paper, we\npropose a Chameleon Hash-based Irreversible Passport (CHIP) protection\nframework that utilizes the cryptographic chameleon hash function to achieve\nall these goals. The collision-resistant property of chameleon hash allows for\nstrong model ownership claim upon IP infringement and liable user traceability,\nwhile the trapdoor-collision property enables hashing of multiple user\npassports and licensee certificates to the same immutable signature to realize\nactive usage control. Using the owner passport as an oracle, multiple\nuser-specific triplets, each contains a passport-aware user model, a user\npassport, and a licensee certificate can be created for secure offline\ndistribution.

A rich line of literature has been\nstudying how to calibrate a model so that its predictions satisfy explicit\nfinite-sample statistical guarantees under a fixed, static, and unknown\ndata-generating distribution. However, prediction-supported decisions may\ninfluence the outcome they aim to predict, a phenomenon named performativity of\npredictions, which is commonly seen in social science and economics.

In the low-variance regime, we calculate the critical strength for the\nresidual connection to ensure signal propagation.

We propose\nDexMachina, a novel curriculum-based algorithm: the key idea is to use virtual\nobject controllers with decaying strength: an object is first driven\nautomatically towards its target states, such that the policy can gradually\nlearn to take over under motion and contact guidance. We release a simulation\nbenchmark with a diverse set of tasks and dexterous hands, and show that\nDexMachina significantly outperforms baseline methods. Our algorithm and\nbenchmark enable a functional comparison for hardware designs, and we present\nkey findings informed by quantitative and qualitative results.

As far as we are aware, this paper presents the\nfirst application in the finance domain of understanding and utilizing the\ninner workings of LLMs through mechanistic interpretability, addressing the\npressing need for transparency and control in AI systems. Mechanistic\ninterpretability is the most intuitive and transparent way to understand LLM\nbehavior by reverse-engineering their internal workings. By dissecting the\nactivations and circuits within these models, it provides insights into how\nspecific features or components influence predictions - making it possible not\nonly to observe but also to modify model behavior. In this paper, we explore\nthe theoretical aspects of mechanistic interpretability and demonstrate its\npractical relevance through a range of financial use cases and experiments,\nincluding applications in trading strategies, sentiment analysis, bias, and\nhallucination detection. While not yet widely adopted, mechanistic\ninterpretability is expected to become increasingly vital as adoption of LLMs\nincreases. Advanced interpretability tools can ensure AI systems remain\nethical, transparent, and aligned with evolving financial regulations.

However, the theoretically tractable models, e.g.,\nperceptrons, random features models and kernel machines, or multi-index models\nand committee machines with few neurons, remained simple compared to those used\nin applications. In this paper we help reducing the gap between practical\nnetworks and their theoretical understanding through a statistical physics\nanalysis of the supervised learning of a two-layer fully connected network with\ngeneric weight distribution and activation function, whose hidden layer is\nlarge but remains proportional to the inputs dimension. This makes it more\nrealistic than infinitely wide networks where no feature learning occurs, but\nalso more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed inner weights. We focus on\nthe Bayes-optimal learning in the teacher-student scenario, i.e., with a\ndataset generated by another network with the same architecture. We operate\naround interpolation, where the number of trainable parameters and of data are\ncomparable and feature learning emerges. Our analysis uncovers a rich\nphenomenology with various learning transitions as the number of data\nincreases. In particular, the more strongly the features (i.e., hidden neurons\nof the target) contribute to the observed responses, the less data is needed to\nlearn them. Moreover, when the data is scarce, the model only learns non-linear\ncombinations of the teacher weights, rather than \"specialising\" by aligning its\nweights with the teacher's.
