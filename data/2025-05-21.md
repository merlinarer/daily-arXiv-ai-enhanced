TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）中奖励模型的偏见问题，特别是前缀偏见，并提出了一种数据增强策略来缓解这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF已成为语言模型任务特定微调的关键范式，但奖励模型中的潜在偏见尚未充分探索。本文旨在检测和评估前缀偏见，揭示其在种族和性别维度上的影响。

Method: 引入新方法来检测和评估前缀偏见，利用这些指标分析开源偏好数据集和奖励模型架构，并提出数据增强策略以减轻偏见。

Result: 研究发现不同模型架构均易受前缀偏见影响，数据增强策略能有效减少偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在设计公平可靠的奖励模型时，偏见感知的数据集设计和评估的重要性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning of language models using human
preference data. While numerous publicly available preference datasets provide
pairwise comparisons of responses, the potential for biases in the resulting
reward models remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce novel methods
to detect and evaluate prefix bias -- a systematic shift in model preferences
triggered by minor variations in query prefixes -- in LLM-based reward models
trained on such datasets. We leverage these metrics to reveal significant
biases in preference models across racial and gender dimensions. Our
comprehensive evaluation spans diverse open-source preference datasets and
reward model architectures, demonstrating susceptibility to this kind of bias
regardless of the underlying model architecture. Furthermore, we propose a data
augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases, showing its effectiveness in
reducing the impact of prefix bias. Our findings highlight the critical need
for bias-aware dataset design and evaluation in developing fair and reliable
reward models, contributing to the broader discourse on fairness in AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Time-R1框架，通过三阶段强化学习课程，赋予中等规模LLM全面的时间能力（理解、预测、创造性生成），并在性能上超越更大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM缺乏时间智能，难以整合过去推理与未来预测，且泛化能力差。Time-R1旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用三阶段强化学习课程，基于动态规则奖励系统，逐步培养时间理解、预测和创造性生成能力。

Result: Time-R1在挑战性任务上表现优于200倍大的模型（如671B DeepSeek-R1）。

Conclusion: 精心设计的渐进式RL微调可使小模型实现卓越时间性能，为时间感知AI提供可行路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities but lack
robust temporal intelligence, struggling to integrate reasoning about the past
with predictions and plausible generations of the future. Meanwhile, existing
methods typically target isolated temporal skills, such as question answering
about past events or basic forecasting, and exhibit poor generalization,
particularly when dealing with events beyond their knowledge cutoff or
requiring creative foresight. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textit{Time-R1}, the first framework to endow a moderate-sized (3B-parameter)
LLM with comprehensive temporal abilities: understanding, prediction, and
creative generation. Our approach features a novel three-stage development
path; the first two constitute a \textit{reinforcement learning (RL)
curriculum} driven by a meticulously designed dynamic rule-based reward system.
This framework progressively builds (1) foundational temporal understanding and
logical event-time mappings from historical data, (2) future event prediction
skills for events beyond its knowledge cutoff, and finally (3) enables
remarkable generalization to creative future scenario generation without any
fine-tuning. Strikingly, experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 outperforms
models over 200 times larger, including the state-of-the-art 671B DeepSeek-R1,
on highly challenging future event prediction and creative scenario generation
benchmarks. This work provides strong evidence that thoughtfully engineered,
progressive RL fine-tuning allows smaller, efficient models to achieve superior
temporal performance, offering a practical and scalable path towards truly
time-aware AI. To foster further research, we also release \textit{Time-Bench},
a large-scale multi-task temporal reasoning dataset derived from 10 years of
news data, and our series of \textit{Time-R1} checkpoints.

TL;DR: EfficientLLM是一个评估LLM效率技术的基准和实证研究，涵盖架构预训练、微调和推理三个关键方向，定义了六个细粒度指标，并得出效率与任务、规模相关的核心见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM参数和上下文窗口的增加，计算、能源和成本变得不可承受，因此需要系统评估效率技术。

Method: 在48xGH200和8xH200 GPU集群上，系统评估了100多个模型-技术组合，涵盖高效注意力变体、稀疏MoE、参数高效微调和量化方法。

Result: 研究发现效率涉及可量化的权衡，最优方法取决于任务和规模，且技术可跨模态泛化。

Conclusion: EfficientLLM为下一代基础模型的效率-性能权衡提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven significant progress, yet their
growing parameter counts and context windows incur prohibitive compute, energy,
and monetary costs. We introduce EfficientLLM, a novel benchmark and the first
comprehensive empirical study evaluating efficiency techniques for LLMs at
scale. Conducted on a production-class cluster (48xGH200, 8xH200 GPUs), our
study systematically explores three key axes: (1) architecture pretraining
(efficient attention variants: MQA, GQA, MLA, NSA; sparse Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE)), (2) fine-tuning (parameter-efficient methods: LoRA, RSLoRA, DoRA), and
(3) inference (quantization methods: int4, float16). We define six fine-grained
metrics (Memory Utilization, Compute Utilization, Latency, Throughput, Energy
Consumption, Compression Rate) to capture hardware saturation,
latency-throughput balance, and carbon cost. Evaluating over 100
model-technique pairs (0.5B-72B parameters), we derive three core insights: (i)
Efficiency involves quantifiable trade-offs: no single method is universally
optimal; e.g., MoE reduces FLOPs and improves accuracy but increases VRAM by
40%, while int4 quantization cuts memory/energy by up to 3.9x at a 3-5%
accuracy drop. (ii) Optima are task- and scale-dependent: MQA offers optimal
memory-latency trade-offs for constrained devices, MLA achieves lowest
perplexity for quality-critical tasks, and RSLoRA surpasses LoRA efficiency
only beyond 14B parameters. (iii) Techniques generalize across modalities: we
extend evaluations to Large Vision Models (Stable Diffusion 3.5, Wan 2.1) and
Vision-Language Models (Qwen2.5-VL), confirming effective transferability. By
open-sourcing datasets, evaluation pipelines, and leaderboards, EfficientLLM
provides essential guidance for researchers and engineers navigating the
efficiency-performance landscape of next-generation foundation models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ABBA是一种新的参数高效微调（PEFT）架构，通过解耦更新与预训练权重，显著提高了表达性，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应大型语言模型（LLMs）到新领域时，现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）的表达性受限于其结构。ABBA旨在通过完全解耦更新与预训练权重来解决这一问题。

Method: ABBA将更新重新参数化为两个可独立学习的低秩矩阵的Hadamard积，从而在相同参数预算下实现更高的表达性。

Result: ABBA在算术和常识推理基准测试中表现优异，显著优于现有PEFT方法。

Conclusion: ABBA通过解耦设计提高了表达性，为PEFT提供了新的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide
range of tasks, but adapting them efficiently to new domains remains a key
challenge. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by
introducing lightweight, trainable modules while keeping most pre-trained
weights fixed. The prevailing approach, LoRA, models updates using a low-rank
decomposition, but its expressivity is inherently constrained by the rank.
Recent methods like HiRA aim to increase expressivity by incorporating a
Hadamard product with the frozen weights, but still rely on the structure of
the pre-trained model. We introduce ABBA, a new PEFT architecture that
reparameterizes the update as a Hadamard product of two independently learnable
low-rank matrices. In contrast to prior work, ABBA fully decouples the update
from the pre-trained weights, enabling both components to be optimized freely.
This leads to significantly higher expressivity under the same parameter
budget. We formally analyze ABBA's expressive capacity and validate its
advantages through matrix reconstruction experiments. Empirically, ABBA
achieves state-of-the-art results on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning
benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing PEFT methods by a significant
margin across multiple models. Our code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模语言模型（LLMs）的微调计算成本高，需要开发更高效的PEFT方法。

Method: OSoRA扩展了LoRA，通过SVD分解预训练权重矩阵，并优化输出维度向量，同时冻结奇异向量矩阵。

Result: 在数学推理、常识推理等任务中，OSoRA性能与LoRA和VeRA相当或更优，且参数规模线性增长。

Conclusion: 联合训练奇异值和输出维度向量对性能至关重要，OSoRA为高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging
due to their massive scale and associated computational costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methodologies have been proposed as
computational alternatives; however, their implementations still require
significant resources. In this paper, we present OSoRA (Output-Dimension and
Singular-Value Initialized Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel PEFT method for LLMs.
OSoRA extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) by integrating Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) with learnable scaling vectors in a unified framework. It
first performs an SVD of pre-trained weight matrices, then optimizes an
output-dimension vector during training, while keeping the corresponding
singular vector matrices frozen. OSoRA substantially reduces computational
resource requirements by minimizing the number of trainable parameters during
fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations across mathematical reasoning, common
sense reasoning, and other benchmarks demonstrate that OSoRA achieves
comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods like LoRA and
VeRA, while maintaining a linear parameter scaling even as the rank increases
to higher dimensions. Our ablation studies further confirm that jointly
training both the singular values and the output-dimension vector is critical
for optimal performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强LLMs的透明度，揭示其内部如何分解和执行复合任务，为细粒度的指令级激活调控提供可能。

Method: 使用层间上下文掩码和跨任务修补方法验证子任务在不同深度学习；通过LogitLens解码隐藏状态分析层间执行模式。

Result: 在15个两步复合任务和真实世界TRACE基准测试中均观察到一致的逐层执行模式。

Conclusion: LLMs具备内部规划和执行子任务的能力，为指令级激活调控开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) exhibit an $\textit{internal
chain-of-thought}$: they sequentially decompose and execute composite tasks
layer-by-layer. Two claims ground our study: (i) distinct subtasks are learned
at different network depths, and (ii) these subtasks are executed sequentially
across layers. On a benchmark of 15 two-step composite tasks, we employ
layer-from context-masking and propose a novel cross-task patching method,
confirming (i). To examine claim (ii), we apply LogitLens to decode hidden
states, revealing a consistent layerwise execution pattern. We further
replicate our analysis on the real-world $\text{TRACE}$ benchmark, observing
the same stepwise dynamics. Together, our results enhance LLMs transparency by
showing their capacity to internally plan and execute subtasks (or
instructions), opening avenues for fine-grained, instruction-level activation
steering.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在文本评估中的一致性、偏见和框架效应，以确保其公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用四种先进LLMs评估4800条叙述性陈述，并操纵来源标注（LLM或特定国籍人类作者）。

Result: 盲测中LLMs高度一致，但来源标注（特别是中国作者）显著降低一致性，尤其是Deepseek Reasoner。

Conclusion: 框架效应对LLMs的文本评估有深远影响，威胁信息系统的完整性和公平性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used not only to generate text
but also to evaluate it, raising urgent questions about whether their judgments
are consistent, unbiased, and robust to framing effects. In this study, we
systematically examine inter- and intra-model agreement across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (OpenAI o3-mini, Deepseek Reasoner, xAI Grok 2, and
Mistral) tasked with evaluating 4,800 narrative statements on 24 different
topics of social, political, and public health relevance, for a total of
192,000 assessments. We manipulate the disclosed source of each statement to
assess how attribution to either another LLM or a human author of specified
nationality affects evaluation outcomes. We find that, in the blind condition,
different LLMs display a remarkably high degree of inter- and intra-model
agreement across topics. However, this alignment breaks down when source
framing is introduced. Here we show that attributing statements to Chinese
individuals systematically lowers agreement scores across all models, and in
particular for Deepseek Reasoner. Our findings reveal that framing effects can
deeply affect text evaluation, with significant implications for the integrity,
neutrality, and fairness of LLM-mediated information systems.

Motivation: 探讨安全微调在LLMs中的鲁棒性，以应对实际部署中可能的安全风险。

Method: 通过系统性地向模型激活中注入高斯噪声，评估多个开源模型的安全微调效果。

Result: 高斯噪声显著增加有害输出率（p < 0.001），深度安全微调无额外保护，但推理能力基本不受影响。

Conclusion: 当前安全对齐技术存在漏洞，推理和强化学习可能是更鲁棒的安全系统发展方向。

Abstract: Safety guardrails in large language models (LLMs) are a critical component in
preventing harmful outputs. Yet, their resilience under perturbation remains
poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of safety
fine-tuning in LLMs by systematically injecting Gaussian noise into model
activations. We show across multiple open-weight models that (1) Gaussian noise
raises harmful-output rates (p < 0.001) by up to 27%, (2) that deeper safety
fine-tuning affords no extra protection, and (3) that chain-of-thought
reasoning remains largely intact. The findings reveal critical vulnerabilities
in current safety alignment techniques and highlight the potential of
reasoning-based and reinforcement learning approaches as promising direction
for developing more robust AI safety systems. These results have important
implications for real-world deployment of LLMs in safety-critical applications
as these results imply that widely-deployed safety tuning methods can fail even
without adversarial prompts.

Motivation: RAG通过整合外部知识弥补LLM静态知识的不足，但同时也引入了新的攻击面（如语料库中毒）。现有防御方法依赖模型内部知识，与RAG设计理念冲突。

Method: EcoSafeRAG采用句子级处理和诱饵引导的上下文多样性检测，分析候选文档的上下文多样性以识别恶意内容。

Result: 实验表明，EcoSafeRAG在保持实用操作成本的同时（相对Vanilla RAG延迟1.2倍，减少48%-80%的token），实现了最先进的安全性，并提升了干净场景下的RAG性能。

Conclusion: EcoSafeRAG为RAG提供了一种高效且安全的防御方案，解决了现有方法与RAG设计理念的冲突。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) compensates for the static knowledge
limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge,
producing responses with enhanced factual correctness and query-specific
contextualization. However, it also introduces new attack surfaces such as
corpus poisoning at the same time. Most of the existing defense methods rely on
the internal knowledge of the model, which conflicts with the design concept of
RAG. To bridge the gap, EcoSafeRAG uses sentence-level processing and
bait-guided context diversity detection to identify malicious content by
analyzing the context diversity of candidate documents without relying on LLM
internal knowledge. Experiments show EcoSafeRAG delivers state-of-the-art
security with plug-and-play deployment, simultaneously improving clean-scenario
RAG performance while maintaining practical operational costs (relatively
1.2$\times$ latency, 48\%-80\% token reduction versus Vanilla RAG).

Result: 发现诱导头是重复诅咒的关键驱动因素，并验证了正则化技术能有效减少其主导性，提升生成多样性。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM设计和训练提供了新见解，通过抑制诱导头可改善生成质量。

Abstract: Repetition curse is a phenomenon where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate
repetitive sequences of tokens or cyclic sequences. While the repetition curse
has been widely observed, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.
In this work, we investigate the role of induction heads--a specific type of
attention head known for their ability to perform in-context learning--in
driving this repetitive behavior. Specifically, we focus on the "toxicity" of
induction heads, which we define as their tendency to dominate the model's
output logits during repetition, effectively excluding other attention heads
from contributing to the generation process. Our findings have important
implications for the design and training of LLMs. By identifying induction
heads as a key driver of the repetition curse, we provide a mechanistic
explanation for this phenomenon and suggest potential avenues for mitigation.
We also propose a technique with attention head regularization that could be
employed to reduce the dominance of induction heads during generation, thereby
promoting more diverse and coherent outputs.

Abstract: Despite substantial advancements in aligning large language models (LLMs)

discrepancies between alignment-oriented prompts and malicious prompts. To
investigate this, we introduce LogiBreak, a novel and universal black-box
jailbreak method that leverages logical expression translation to circumvent
LLM safety systems. By converting harmful natural language prompts into formal
logical expressions, LogiBreak exploits the distributional gap between
alignment data and logic-based inputs, preserving the underlying semantic
intent and readability while evading safety constraints. We evaluate LogiBreak
on a multilingual jailbreak dataset spanning three languages, demonstrating its
effectiveness across various evaluation settings and linguistic contexts.

Motivation: 在交互式对话系统中，用户对模型的准确性和透明度有高要求。尽管知识蒸馏可以提升小语言模型（SLMs）的性能，但推理痕迹的忠实性和评估仍是一个挑战。

Method: 采用基于规则的问题分解方法，将复杂查询分解为结构化子问题，生成可解释的推理痕迹，并在多个QA数据集上进行实验。

Result: 实验发现，正确的推理痕迹并不一定保证最终答案的正确性，且两者之间的相关性较低。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了利用推理痕迹通过KD提升SLMs性能的隐含假设。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) poses a challenging and critical problem,
particularly in today's age of interactive dialogue systems such as ChatGPT,
Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot, etc. where users demand both accuracy and
transparency in the model's outputs. Since smaller language models (SLMs) are
computationally more efficient but often under-perform compared to larger
models, Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods allow for finetuning these smaller
models to improve their final performance. Lately, the intermediate tokens or
the so called `reasoning' traces produced by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or by
reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 are used as a training signal for KD.
However, these reasoning traces are often verbose and difficult to interpret or
evaluate. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of evaluating the
faithfulness of these reasoning traces and their correlation with the final
performance. To this end, we employ a KD method leveraging rule-based problem
decomposition. This approach allows us to break down complex queries into
structured sub-problems, generating interpretable traces whose correctness can
be readily evaluated, even at inference time. Specifically, we demonstrate this
approach on Open Book QA, decomposing the problem into a Classification step
and an Information Retrieval step, thereby simplifying trace evaluation. Our
SFT experiments with correct and incorrect traces on the CoTemp QA, Microsoft
Machine Reading Comprehension QA, and Facebook bAbI QA datasets reveal the
striking finding that correct traces do not necessarily imply that the model
outputs the correct final solution. Similarly, we find a low correlation
between correct final solutions and intermediate trace correctness. These
results challenge the implicit assumption behind utilizing reasoning traces for
improving SLMs' final performance via KD.

Conclusion: RPC展示了利用推理路径的语义稀疏性进行压缩的潜力，为高效部署推理LLMs提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Recent reasoning-focused language models achieve high accuracy by generating
lengthy intermediate reasoning paths before producing final answers. While this
approach is effective in solving problems that require logical thinking, long
reasoning paths significantly increase memory usage and throughput of token
generation, limiting the practical deployment of such models. We propose
Reasoning Path Compression (RPC), a training-free method that accelerates
inference by leveraging the semantic sparsity of reasoning paths. RPC
periodically compresses the KV cache by retaining KV cache that receive high
importance score, which are computed using a selector window composed of
recently generated queries. Experiments show that RPC improves generation
throughput of QwQ-32B by up to 1.60$\times$ compared to the inference with full
KV cache, with an accuracy drop of 1.2% on the AIME 2024 benchmark. Our
findings demonstrate that semantic sparsity in reasoning traces can be
effectively exploited for compression, offering a practical path toward
efficient deployment of reasoning LLMs. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling have enabled Large Language Models
(LLMs) to display sophisticated reasoning abilities via extended
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation. Despite their potential, these Reasoning
LLMs (RLMs) often demonstrate counterintuitive and unstable behaviors, such as
performance degradation under few-shot prompting, that challenge our current
understanding of RLMs. In this work, we introduce a unified graph-based
analytical framework for better modeling the reasoning processes of RLMs. Our
method first clusters long, verbose CoT outputs into semantically coherent
reasoning steps, then constructs directed reasoning graphs to capture
contextual and logical dependencies among these steps. Through comprehensive
analysis across models and prompting regimes, we reveal that structural
properties, such as exploration density, branching, and convergence ratios,
strongly correlate with reasoning accuracy. Our findings demonstrate how
prompting strategies substantially reshape the internal reasoning structure of
RLMs, directly affecting task outcomes. The proposed framework not only enables
quantitative evaluation of reasoning quality beyond conventional metrics but
also provides practical insights for prompt engineering and the cognitive
analysis of LLMs. Code and resources will be released to facilitate future
research in this direction.

Conclusion: InfiGFusion通过显式建模语义依赖，显著提升了异构模型融合的效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified efforts to
fuse heterogeneous open-source models into a unified system that inherits their
complementary strengths. Existing logit-based fusion methods maintain inference
efficiency but treat vocabulary dimensions independently, overlooking semantic
dependencies encoded by cross-dimension interactions. These dependencies
reflect how token types interact under a model's internal reasoning and are
essential for aligning models with diverse generation behaviors. To explicitly
model these dependencies, we propose \textbf{InfiGFusion}, the first
structure-aware fusion framework with a novel \textit{Graph-on-Logits
Distillation} (GLD) loss. Specifically, we retain the top-$k$ logits per output
and aggregate their outer products across sequence positions to form a global
co-activation graph, where nodes represent vocabulary channels and edges
quantify their joint activations. To ensure scalability and efficiency, we
design a sorting-based closed-form approximation that reduces the original
$O(n^4)$ cost of Gromov-Wasserstein distance to $O(n \log n)$, with provable
approximation guarantees. Experiments across multiple fusion settings show that
GLD consistently improves fusion quality and stability. InfiGFusion outperforms
SOTA models and fusion baselines across 11 benchmarks spanning reasoning,
coding, and mathematics. It shows particular strength in complex reasoning
tasks, with +35.6 improvement on Multistep Arithmetic and +37.06 on Causal
Judgement over SFT, demonstrating superior multi-step and relational inference.

Conclusion: FlashThink方法实现了高效推理，减少了计算开销，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in reasoning
tasks. However, LLMs tend to generate excessively long reasoning content,
leading to significant computational overhead. Our observations indicate that
even on simple problems, LLMs tend to produce unnecessarily lengthy reasoning
content, which is against intuitive expectations. Preliminary experiments show
that at a certain point during the generation process, the model is already
capable of producing the correct solution without completing the full reasoning
content. Therefore, we consider that the reasoning process of the model can be
exited early to achieve the purpose of efficient reasoning. We introduce a
verification model that identifies the exact moment when the model can stop
reasoning and still provide the correct answer. Comprehensive experiments on
four different benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method, FlashThink,
effectively shortens the reasoning content while preserving the model accuracy.
For the Deepseek-R1 and QwQ-32B models, we reduced the length of reasoning
content by 77.04% and 77.47%, respectively, without reducing the accuracy.

Abstract: Quantization methods are widely used to accelerate inference and streamline
the deployment of large language models (LLMs). While prior research has
extensively investigated the degradation of various LLM capabilities due to
quantization, its effects on model explainability and interpretability, which
are crucial for understanding decision-making processes, remain unexplored. To
address this gap, we conduct comprehensive experiments using three common
quantization techniques at distinct bit widths, in conjunction with two
explainability methods, counterfactual examples and natural language
explanations, as well as two interpretability approaches, knowledge
memorization analysis and latent multi-hop reasoning analysis. We complement
our analysis with a thorough user study, evaluating selected explainability
methods. Our findings reveal that, depending on the configuration, quantization
can significantly impact model explainability and interpretability. Notably,
the direction of this effect is not consistent, as it strongly depends on (1)
the quantization method, (2) the explainability or interpretability approach,
and (3) the evaluation protocol. In some settings, human evaluation shows that
quantization degrades explainability, while in others, it even leads to
improvements. Our work serves as a cautionary tale, demonstrating that
quantization can unpredictably affect model transparency. This insight has
important implications for deploying LLMs in applications where transparency is
a critical requirement.

Conclusion: 完全自动化的CDA可能不足，需结合人工干预。

Abstract: Counterfactual examples are widely employed to enhance the performance and
robustness of large language models (LLMs) through counterfactual data
augmentation (CDA). However, the selection of the judge model used to evaluate
label flipping, the primary metric for assessing the validity of generated
counterfactuals for CDA, yields inconsistent results. To decipher this, we
define four types of relationships between the counterfactual generator and
judge models. Through extensive experiments involving two state-of-the-art
LLM-based methods, three datasets, five generator models, and 15 judge models,
complemented by a user study (n = 90), we demonstrate that judge models with an
independent, non-fine-tuned relationship to the generator model provide the
most reliable label flipping evaluations. Relationships between the generator
and judge models, which are closely aligned with the user study for CDA, result
in better model performance and robustness. Nevertheless, we find that the gap
between the most effective judge models and the results obtained from the user
study remains considerably large. This suggests that a fully automated pipeline
for CDA may be inadequate and requires human intervention.

Conclusion: DRP通过调整训练CoTs的推理结构与学生的推理能力对齐，实现了高效的知识迁移和性能提升。

Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated success in complex
reasoning tasks through long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, their inference
often involves excessively verbose reasoning traces, resulting in substantial
inefficiency. To address this, we propose Distilled Reasoning Pruning (DRP), a
hybrid framework that combines inference-time pruning with tuning-based
distillation, two widely used strategies for efficient reasoning. DRP uses a
teacher model to perform skill-aware step decomposition and content pruning,
and then distills the pruned reasoning paths into a student model, enabling it
to reason both efficiently and accurately. Across several challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets, we find that models trained with DRP achieve
substantial improvements in token efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
Specifically, DRP reduces average token usage on GSM8K from 917 to 328 while
improving accuracy from 91.7% to 94.1%, and achieves a 43% token reduction on
AIME with no performance drop. Further analysis shows that aligning the
reasoning structure of training CoTs with the student's reasoning capacity is
critical for effective knowledge transfer and performance gains.

Conclusion: RFT需谨慎使用，结合SUM数据可提升模型对自身不确定性的推理能力，改善泛化性。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) has become a standard approach for enhancing
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, its impact
on model trustworthiness remains underexplored. In this work, we identify and
systematically study a critical side effect of RFT, which we term the
hallucination tax: a degradation in refusal behavior causing models to produce
hallucinated answers to unanswerable questions confidently. To investigate
this, we introduce SUM (Synthetic Unanswerable Math), a high-quality dataset of
unanswerable math problems designed to probe models' ability to recognize an
unanswerable question by reasoning from the insufficient or ambiguous
information. Our results show that standard RFT training could reduce model
refusal rates by more than 80%, which significantly increases model's tendency
to hallucinate. We further demonstrate that incorporating just 10% SUM during
RFT substantially restores appropriate refusal behavior, with minimal accuracy
trade-offs on solvable tasks. Crucially, this approach enables LLMs to leverage
inference-time compute to reason about their own uncertainty and knowledge
boundaries, improving generalization not only to out-of-domain math problems
but also to factual question answering tasks.

Abstract: Instruction-following has emerged as a crucial capability for large language

documents or external resources to synthesize instruction-following data, which
limits their flexibility and generalizability. In this paper, we introduce
DecIF, a fully autonomous, meta-decomposition guided framework that generates
diverse and high-quality instruction-following data using only LLMs. DecIF is
grounded in the principle of decomposition. For instruction generation, we
guide LLMs to iteratively produce various types of meta-information, which are
then combined with response constraints to form well-structured and
semantically rich instructions. We further utilize LLMs to detect and resolve
potential inconsistencies within the generated instructions. Regarding response
generation, we decompose each instruction into atomic-level evaluation
criteria, enabling rigorous validation and the elimination of inaccurate
instruction-response pairs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
scenarios and settings demonstrate DecIF's superior performance on
instruction-following tasks. Further analysis highlights its strong
flexibility, scalability, and generalizability in automatically synthesizing
high-quality instruction data.

Conclusion: 研究为理解和解决这一被低估但重要的问题提供了理论基础和实证工具。

Abstract: A serious risk to the safety and utility of LLMs is sycophancy, i.e.,
excessive agreement with and flattery of the user. Yet existing work focuses on
only one aspect of sycophancy: agreement with users' explicitly stated beliefs
that can be compared to a ground truth. This overlooks forms of sycophancy that
arise in ambiguous contexts such as advice and support-seeking, where there is
no clear ground truth, yet sycophancy can reinforce harmful implicit
assumptions, beliefs, or actions. To address this gap, we introduce a richer
theory of social sycophancy in LLMs, characterizing sycophancy as the excessive
preservation of a user's face (the positive self-image a person seeks to
maintain in an interaction). We present ELEPHANT, a framework for evaluating
social sycophancy across five face-preserving behaviors (emotional validation,
moral endorsement, indirect language, indirect action, and accepting framing)
on two datasets: open-ended questions (OEQ) and Reddit's r/AmITheAsshole
(AITA). Across eight models, we show that LLMs consistently exhibit high rates
of social sycophancy: on OEQ, they preserve face 47% more than humans, and on
AITA, they affirm behavior deemed inappropriate by crowdsourced human judgments
in 42% of cases. We further show that social sycophancy is rewarded in
preference datasets and is not easily mitigated. Our work provides theoretical
grounding and empirical tools (datasets and code) for understanding and
addressing this under-recognized but consequential issue.

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on reconciling the reasoning

training-based and prompt-based approaches face significant challenges in terms
of efficiency and stability, model merging emerges as a promising strategy to
integrate the diverse capabilities of different Large Language Models (LLMs)

uniform importance across layers, overlooking the functional heterogeneity
inherent in neural components. To address this limitation, we propose
\textbf{A}ctivation-Guided \textbf{C}onsensus \textbf{M}erging (\textbf{ACM}),
a plug-and-play merging framework that determines layer-specific merging
coefficients based on mutual information between activations of pre-trained and
fine-tuned models. ACM effectively preserves task-specific capabilities without
requiring gradient computations or additional training. Extensive experiments
on Long-to-Short (L2S) and general merging tasks demonstrate that ACM
consistently outperforms all baseline methods. For instance, in the case of
Qwen-7B models, TIES-Merging equipped with ACM achieves a \textbf{55.3\%}
reduction in response length while simultaneously improving reasoning accuracy
by \textbf{1.3} points. We submit the code with the paper for reproducibility,

Abstract: Continued pretraining and instruction tuning on large-scale multilingual data
have proven to be effective in scaling large language models (LLMs) to
low-resource languages. However, the unaligned nature of such data limits its
ability to effectively capture cross-lingual semantics. In contrast, multi-way
parallel data, where identical content is aligned across multiple languages,
provides stronger cross-lingual consistency and offers greater potential for
improving multilingual performance. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale,
high-quality multi-way parallel corpus, TED2025, based on TED Talks. The corpus
spans 113 languages, with up to 50 languages aligned in parallel, ensuring
extensive multilingual coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate best
practices for leveraging multi-way parallel data to enhance LLMs, including
strategies for continued pretraining, instruction tuning, and the analysis of
key influencing factors. Experiments on six multilingual benchmarks show that
models trained on multiway parallel data consistently outperform those trained

pre-trained corpus. We propose a comprehensive multi-domain knowledge element
pool and introduce knowledge density and coverage as metrics to assess the
knowledge content of the text. Based on this, we propose a comprehensive
knowledge scorer to select data with intensive knowledge, which can also be
utilized for domain-specific high-knowledge data selection by restricting
knowledge elements to the specific domain. We train models on a high-knowledge
bilingual dataset, and experimental results demonstrate that our scorer
improves the model's performance in knowledge-intensive and general
comprehension tasks, and is effective in enhancing both the generic and
domain-specific capabilities of the model.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agents have shown great potential in
following human instructions and automatically completing various tasks. To
complete a task, the agent needs to decompose it into easily executed steps by
planning. Existing studies mainly conduct the planning by inferring what steps
should be executed next starting from the agent's initial state. However, this
forward reasoning paradigm doesn't work well for complex tasks. We propose to
study this issue in Minecraft, a virtual environment that simulates complex
tasks based on real-world scenarios. We believe that the failure of forward
reasoning is caused by the big perception gap between the agent's initial state
and task goal. To this end, we leverage backward reasoning and make the
planning starting from the terminal state, which can directly achieve the task
goal in one step. Specifically, we design a BAckward Reasoning based agent
(BAR). It is equipped with a recursive goal decomposition module, a state
consistency maintaining module and a stage memory module to make robust,
consistent, and efficient planning starting from the terminal state.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BAR over existing methods
and the effectiveness of proposed modules.

Abstract: Language models encode and subsequently perpetuate harmful gendered
stereotypes. Research has succeeded in mitigating some of these harms, e.g. by
dissociating non-gendered terms such as occupations from gendered terms such as
'woman' and 'man'. This approach, however, remains superficial given that
associations are only one form of prejudice through which gendered harms arise.
Critical scholarship on gender, such as gender performativity theory,
emphasizes how harms often arise from the construction of gender itself, such
as conflating gender with biological sex. In language models, these issues
could lead to the erasure of transgender and gender diverse identities and
cause harms in downstream applications, from misgendering users to
misdiagnosing patients based on wrong assumptions about their anatomy.
  For FAccT research on gendered harms to go beyond superficial linguistic
associations, we advocate for a broader definition of 'gender bias' in language
models. We operationalize insights on the construction of gender through
language from gender studies literature and then empirically test how 16
language models of different architectures, training datasets, and model sizes
encode gender. We find that language models tend to encode gender as a binary
category tied to biological sex, and that gendered terms that do not neatly
fall into one of these binary categories are erased and pathologized. Finally,
we show that larger models, which achieve better results on performance
benchmarks, learn stronger associations between gender and sex, further
reinforcing a narrow understanding of gender. Our findings lead us to call for
a re-evaluation of how gendered harms in language models are defined and
addressed.

Result: KG-RAG在语义相似度得分上比普通QA提高了0.12到0.36分，证明了KG集成的有效性。

Conclusion: MultiHal基准测试有望推动基于图谱的幻觉缓解和事实核查任务的未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have inherent limitations of faithfulness and
factuality, commonly referred to as hallucinations. Several benchmarks have
been developed that provide a test bed for factuality evaluation within the
context of English-centric datasets, while relying on supplementary informative
context like web links or text passages but ignoring the available structured
factual resources. To this end, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been identified as
a useful aid for hallucination mitigation, as they provide a structured way to
represent the facts about entities and their relations with minimal linguistic
overhead. We bridge the lack of KG paths and multilinguality for factual
language modeling within the existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks and
propose a KG-based multilingual, multihop benchmark called \textbf{MultiHal}
framed for generative text evaluation. As part of our data collection pipeline,
we mined 140k KG-paths from open-domain KGs, from which we pruned noisy
KG-paths, curating a high-quality subset of 25.9k. Our baseline evaluation
shows an absolute scale increase by approximately 0.12 to 0.36 points for the
semantic similarity score in KG-RAG over vanilla QA across multiple languages
and multiple models, demonstrating the potential of KG integration. We
anticipate MultiHal will foster future research towards several graph-based
hallucination mitigation and fact-checking tasks.

Abstract: We present PersonaConvBench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating
personalized reasoning and generation in multi-turn conversations with large
language models (LLMs). Unlike existing work that focuses on either
personalization or conversational structure in isolation, PersonaConvBench
integrates both, offering three core tasks: sentence classification, impact
regression, and user-centric text generation across ten diverse Reddit-based
domains. This design enables systematic analysis of how personalized
conversational context shapes LLM outputs in realistic multi-user scenarios. We
benchmark several commercial and open-source LLMs under a unified prompting
setup and observe that incorporating personalized history yields substantial
performance improvements, including a 198 percent relative gain over the best
non-conversational baseline in sentiment classification. By releasing
PersonaConvBench with evaluations and code, we aim to support research on LLMs
that adapt to individual styles, track long-term context, and produce
contextually rich, engaging responses.

Motivation: 现有基于Logit的LLM水印方法在低熵场景下表现不佳，且依赖原始LLM导致高计算成本和潜在泄漏风险。

Method: 引入轻量级特征提取器和熵标记器预测令牌熵，开发自适应阈值导航器优化水印比例。

Result: 在HumanEval和MBPP数据集上，IE参数减少99%，性能与现有最优方法相当。

Conclusion: IE为低熵水印提供了一种安全高效的范式。

Abstract: Logit-based LLM watermarking traces and verifies AI-generated content by
maintaining green and red token lists and increasing the likelihood of green
tokens during generation. However, it fails in low-entropy scenarios, where
predictable outputs make green token selection difficult without disrupting
natural text flow. Existing approaches address this by assuming access to the
original LLM to calculate entropy and selectively watermark high-entropy
tokens. However, these methods face two major challenges: (1) high
computational costs and detection delays due to reliance on the original LLM,
and (2) potential risks of model leakage. To address these limitations, we
propose Invisible Entropy (IE), a watermarking paradigm designed to enhance
both safety and efficiency. Instead of relying on the original LLM, IE
introduces a lightweight feature extractor and an entropy tagger to predict
whether the entropy of the next token is high or low. Furthermore, based on
theoretical analysis, we develop a threshold navigator that adaptively sets
entropy thresholds. It identifies a threshold where the watermark ratio
decreases as the green token count increases, enhancing the naturalness of the
watermarked text and improving detection robustness. Experiments on HumanEval
and MBPP datasets demonstrate that IE reduces parameter size by 99\% while
achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art methods. Our work introduces
a safe and efficient paradigm for low-entropy watermarking.

Method: 引入SRLM，利用少量示例（如1,000样本）作为推理催化剂，模型自合成更长思维链数据并迭代优化。

Result: 在五个推理任务（MMLU、GSM8K等）上平均提升2.5分，采样64次时提升达7.89分。

Conclusion: SRLM通过自训练和多样化推理路径，显著提升LLM推理性能。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has attracted much attention which significantly
enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning
tasks by increasing the length of Chain-of-Thought. These longer intermediate
reasoning rationales embody various meta-reasoning skills in human cognition,
such as reflection and decomposition, being difficult to create and acquire. In
this work, we introduce \textit{Self-Reasoning Language Model} (SRLM), where
the model itself can synthesize longer CoT data and iteratively improve
performance through self-training. By incorporating a few demonstration
examples (i.e., 1,000 samples) on how to unfold hidden reasoning chains from
existing responses, which act as a reasoning catalyst, we demonstrate that SRLM
not only enhances the model's initial performance but also ensures more stable
and consistent improvements in subsequent iterations. Our proposed SRLM
achieves an average absolute improvement of more than $+2.5$ points across five
reasoning tasks: MMLU, GSM8K, ARC-C, HellaSwag, and BBH on two backbone models.
Moreover, it brings more improvements with more times of sampling during
inference, such as absolute $+7.89$ average improvement with $64$ sampling
times, revealing the in-depth, diverse and creative reasoning paths in SRLM
against the strong baseline.

Abstract: This paper investigates prior prompt engineering (pPE) in the context of
reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), where language models (LMs) are incentivized
to exhibit behaviors that maximize performance through reward signals. While
existing RFT research has primarily focused on algorithms, reward shaping, and
data curation, the design of the prior prompt--the instructions prepended to
queries during training to elicit behaviors such as step-by-step
reasoning--remains underexplored. We investigate whether different pPE
approaches can guide LMs to internalize distinct behaviors after RFT. Inspired
by inference-time prompt engineering (iPE), we translate five representative
iPE strategies--reasoning, planning, code-based reasoning, knowledge recall,
and null-example utilization--into corresponding pPE approaches. We experiment
with Qwen2.5-7B using each of the pPE approaches, then evaluate performance on
in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks (e.g., AIME2024, HumanEval+, and
GPQA-Diamond). Our results show that all pPE-trained models surpass their
iPE-prompted counterparts, with the null-example pPE approach achieving the
largest average performance gain and the highest improvement on AIME2024 and
GPQA-Diamond, surpassing the commonly used reasoning approach. Furthermore, by
adapting a behavior-classification framework, we demonstrate that different pPE
strategies instill distinct behavioral styles in the resulting models. These
findings position pPE as a powerful yet understudied axis for RFT.

ground three versions of LLaMA 2 to specific points in time and examine the
effects of varying injection layers and prompting strategies. Our experiments
demonstrate up to a 44% and 16% improvement in relative and explicit prompting
respectively, achieving comparable performance to the fine-tuning method

Abstract: Despite their remarkable progress across diverse domains, Large Language
Models (LLMs) consistently fail at simple character-level tasks, such as
counting letters in words, due to a fundamental limitation: tokenization. In
this work, we frame this limitation as a problem of low mutual information and
analyze it in terms of concept emergence. Using a suite of 19 synthetic tasks
that isolate character-level reasoning in a controlled setting, we show that
such capabilities emerge slowly, suddenly, and only late in training. We
further show that percolation-based models of concept emergence explain these
patterns, suggesting that learning character composition is not fundamentally
different from learning commonsense knowledge. To address this bottleneck, we
propose a lightweight architectural modification that significantly improves
character-level reasoning while preserving the inductive advantages of subword
models. Together, our results bridge low-level perceptual gaps in tokenized LMs
and provide a principled framework for understanding and mitigating their
structural blind spots. We make our code publicly available.

Abstract: LLMs are effective at code generation tasks like text-to-SQL, but is it worth
the cost? Many state-of-the-art approaches use non-task-specific LLM techniques
including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), self-consistency, and fine-tuning. These
methods can be costly at inference time, sometimes requiring over a hundred LLM
calls with reasoning, incurring average costs of up to \$0.46 per query, while
fine-tuning models can cost thousands of dollars. We introduce "N-rep"
consistency, a more cost-efficient text-to-SQL approach that achieves similar
BIRD benchmark scores as other more expensive methods, at only \$0.039 per
query. N-rep leverages multiple representations of the same schema input to
mitigate weaknesses in any single representation, making the solution more
robust and allowing the use of smaller and cheaper models without any reasoning
or fine-tuning. To our knowledge, N-rep is the best-performing text-to-SQL
approach in its cost range.

Conclusion: 符号推理能力不仅取决于模型架构，还受分词表示的影响。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first - and often underappreciated - layer of computation
in language models. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables transformer
models to approximate recurrent computation by externalizing intermediate
steps, we show that the success of such reasoning is fundamentally bounded by
the structure of tokenized inputs. This work presents a theoretical and
empirical investigation into how tokenization schemes, particularly
subword-based methods like byte-pair encoding (BPE), impede symbolic
computation by merging or obscuring atomic reasoning units. We introduce the
notion of Token Awareness to formalize how poor token granularity disrupts
logical alignment and prevents models from generalizing symbolic procedures.
Through systematic evaluation on arithmetic and symbolic tasks, we demonstrate
that token structure dramatically affect reasoning performance, causing failure
even with CoT, while atomically-aligned formats unlock strong generalization,
allowing small models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) to outperform larger systems (e.g.,
o1) in structured reasoning. Our findings reveal that symbolic reasoning
ability in LLMs is not purely architectural, but deeply conditioned on
token-level representations.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at solving complex tasks by leveraging

We observe that LRMs inherently possess the capability for efficient short CoT
reasoning, which can be reliably elicited through prompt design. To leverage
this capability, we propose ThinkSwitcher, a framework that enables a single
LRM to dynamically switch between short and long CoT modes based on task
complexity. ThinkSwitcher introduces a lightweight switching module trained
with supervision signals derived from the relative performance of each
reasoning mode across tasks. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show
that ThinkSwitcher reduces computational cost by 20-30% while maintaining high
accuracy on complex tasks. This demonstrates the effectiveness of ThinkSwitcher
as a scalable and efficient solution for unified LRM deployment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been fueled by large
scale training corpora drawn from diverse sources such as websites, news
articles, and books. These datasets often contain explicit user information,
such as person names and addresses, that LLMs may unintentionally reproduce in
their generated outputs. Beyond such explicit content, LLMs can also leak
identity revealing cues through implicit signals such as distinctive writing
styles, raising significant concerns about authorship privacy. There are three
major automated tasks in authorship privacy, namely authorship obfuscation
(AO), authorship mimicking (AM), and authorship verification (AV). Prior
research has studied AO, AM, and AV independently. However, their interplays
remain under explored, which leaves a major research gap, especially in the era
of LLMs, where they are profoundly shaping how we curate and share user
generated content, and the distinction between machine generated and human
authored text is also increasingly blurred. This work then presents the first
unified framework for analyzing the dynamic relationships among LLM enabled AO,
AM, and AV in the context of authorship privacy. We quantify how they interact
with each other to transform human authored text, examining effects at a single
point in time and iteratively over time. We also examine the role of
demographic metadata, such as gender, academic background, in modulating their

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful, with
multilingual and multimodal capabilities improving by the day. These models are
being evaluated through audits, alignment studies and red-teaming efforts to
expose model vulnerabilities towards generating harmful, biased and unfair
content. Existing red-teaming efforts have previously focused on the English
language, using fixed template-based attacks; thus, models continue to be
susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially in the
multimodal context. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages
code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and
image generation tasks. We also introduce two new jailbreak strategies that
show higher effectiveness than baseline strategies. Our work presents a method
to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability
by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. Our
novel prompts achieve a 99% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78% for
image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100% for text generation and
95% for image generation when using the phonetically perturbed code-mixed
prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations
impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates
increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for
multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein
prompts can have misspelt words.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) utilizes structured demonstration-query inputs to
induce few-shot learning on Language Models (LMs), which are not originally
pre-trained on ICL-style data. To bridge the gap between ICL and pre-training,
some approaches fine-tune LMs on large ICL-style datasets by an end-to-end
paradigm with massive computational costs. To reduce such costs, in this paper,
we propose Attention Behavior Fine-Tuning (ABFT), utilizing the previous
findings on the inner mechanism of ICL, building training objectives on the
attention scores instead of the final outputs, to force the attention scores to
focus on the correct label tokens presented in the context and mitigate
attention scores from the wrong label tokens. Our experiments on 9 modern LMs
and 8 datasets empirically find that ABFT outperforms in performance,
robustness, unbiasedness, and efficiency, with only around 0.01% data cost
compared to the previous methods. Moreover, our subsequent analysis finds that
the end-to-end training objective contains the ABFT objective, suggesting the
implicit bias of ICL-style data to the emergence of induction heads. Our work
demonstrates the possibility of controlling specific module sequences within
LMs to improve their behavior, opening up the future application of mechanistic
interpretability.

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex instructions,
leading to poor performances on those not well represented among general
samples. To address this, SLOT conducts few optimization steps at test-time to
update a light-weight sample-specific parameter vector. It is added to the
final hidden layer before the output head, and enables efficient adaptation by
caching the last layer features during per-sample optimization. By minimizing
the cross-entropy loss on the input prompt only, SLOT helps the model better
aligned with and follow each given instruction. In experiments, we demonstrate
that our method outperforms the compared models across multiple benchmarks and
LLMs. For example, Qwen2.5-7B with SLOT achieves an accuracy gain of 8.6% on
GSM8K from 57.54% to 66.19%, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B with SLOT
achieves a SOTA accuracy of 68.69% on GPQA among 70B-level models. Our code is

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge refers to the automatic modeling of preferences for responses
generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which is of significant importance
for both LLM evaluation and reward modeling. Although generative LLMs have made
substantial progress in various tasks, their performance as LLM-Judge still
falls short of expectations. In this work, we propose Think-J, which improves
generative LLM-as-a-Judge by learning how to think. We first utilized a small
amount of curated data to develop the model with initial judgment thinking
capabilities. Subsequently, we optimize the judgment thinking traces based on
reinforcement learning (RL). We propose two methods for judgment thinking
optimization, based on offline and online RL, respectively. The offline RL
requires training a critic model to construct positive and negative examples
for learning. The online method defines rule-based reward as feedback for
optimization. Experimental results showed that our approach can significantly
enhance the evaluation capability of generative LLM-Judge, surpassing both
generative and classifier-based LLM-Judge without requiring extra human
annotations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on formal tasks,
where strong reasoning abilities define the state of the art. However, their
ability to generalize to out-of-distribution problems remains limited. In this
paper, we investigate how LLMs can achieve a systematic understanding of
deductive rules. Our focus is on the task of identifying the appropriate subset
of premises within a knowledge base needed to derive a given hypothesis. To
tackle this challenge, we propose Meta-learning for In-context Deduction
(MIND), a novel few-shot meta-learning fine-tuning approach. The goal of MIND
is to enable models to generalize more effectively to unseen knowledge bases
and to systematically apply inference rules. Our results show that MIND
significantly improves generalization in small LMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B
parameters. The benefits are especially pronounced in smaller models and
low-data settings. Remarkably, small models fine-tuned with MIND outperform
state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and o3-mini, on this task.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
enabling high-quality text generation through prompting and in-context
learning. However, models often struggle with long-context summarization due to
positional biases, leading to suboptimal extraction of critical information.
There are techniques to improve this with fine-tuning, pipelining, or using
complex techniques, which have their own challenges. To solve these challenges,
we propose QA-prompting - a simple prompting method for summarization that
utilizes question-answering as an intermediate step prior to summary
generation. Our method extracts key information and enriches the context of
text to mitigate positional biases and improve summarization in a single LM
call per task without requiring fine-tuning or pipelining. Experiments on
multiple datasets belonging to different domains using ten state-of-the-art
pre-trained models demonstrate that QA-prompting outperforms baseline and other
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 29% improvement in ROUGE scores. This
provides an effective and scalable solution for summarization and highlights
the importance of domain-specific question selection for optimal performance.

Conclusion: DuDe通过分解策略提升了优化稳定性并更好地保留了预训练表示，是PEFT领域的重要贡献。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical paradigm for
adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, among which Low-rank
Adaptation (LoRA) represents one of the most widely adopted methodologies.
However, existing LoRA-based approaches exhibit two fundamental limitations:
unstable training dynamics and inefficient knowledge transfer from pre-trained
models, both stemming from random initialization of adapter parameters. To
overcome these challenges, we propose DuDe, a novel approach that decomposes
weight matrices into magnitude and direction components, employing Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) for principled initialization. Our comprehensive
evaluation demonstrates DuDe's superior performance and robustness, achieving
up to 48.35\% accuracy on MMLU and 62.53\% ($\pm$ 1.59) accuracy on GSM8K. Our
theoretical analysis and empirical validation collectively demonstrate that
DuDe's decomposition strategy enhances optimization stability and better
preserves pre-trained representations, particularly for domain-specific tasks
requiring specialized knowledge. The combination of robust empirical
performance and rigorous theoretical foundations establishes DuDe as a
significant contribution to PEFT methodologies for LLMs.

Abstract: Evaluating text generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is
challenging, particularly for low-resource languages where methods for direct
assessment are scarce. We propose MUG-Eval, a novel framework that evaluates
LLMs' multilingual generation capabilities by transforming existing benchmarks
into conversational tasks and measuring the LLMs' accuracies on those tasks. We
specifically designed these conversational tasks to require effective
communication in the target language. Then, we simply use task success rate as
a proxy of successful conversation generation. Our approach offers two key
advantages: it is independent of language-specific NLP tools or annotated
datasets, which are limited for most languages, and it does not rely on
LLMs-as-judges, whose evaluation quality degrades outside a few high-resource
languages. We evaluate 8 LLMs across 30 languages spanning high, mid, and
low-resource categories, and we find that MUG-Eval correlates strongly with
established benchmarks ($r$ > 0.75) while enabling standardized comparisons
across languages and models. Our framework provides a robust and
resource-efficient solution for evaluating multilingual generation that can be
extended to thousands of languages.

Abstract: While humans naturally learn and adapt from past experiences, large language
models (LLMs) and their agentic counterparts struggle to retain reasoning from
previous tasks and apply them in future contexts. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel framework, log-augmented generation (LAG) that directly
reuses prior computation and reasoning from past logs at test time to enhance
model's ability to learn from previous tasks and perform better on new, unseen
challenges, all while keeping the system efficient and scalable. Specifically,
our system represents task logs using key-value (KV) caches, encoding the full
reasoning context of prior tasks while storing KV caches for only a selected
subset of tokens. When a new task arises, LAG retrieves the KV values from
relevant logs to augment generation. Our approach differs from reflection-based
memory mechanisms by directly reusing prior reasoning and computations without
requiring additional steps for knowledge extraction or distillation. Our method
also goes beyond existing KV caching techniques, which primarily target
efficiency gains rather than improving accuracy. Experiments on knowledge- and
reasoning-intensive datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms standard agentic systems that do not utilize logs, as well as
existing solutions based on reflection and KV cache techniques.

analysis, PhantomCircuit dissects the internal workings of attention heads,
tracing how competing knowledge pathways contribute to the overshadowing
phenomenon and its evolution throughout the training process. Extensive

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents powered by multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have shown greater promise for human-interaction. However, due
to the high fine-tuning cost, users often rely on open-source GUI agents or
APIs offered by AI providers, which introduces a critical but underexplored
supply chain threat: backdoor attacks. In this work, we first unveil that
MLLM-powered GUI agents naturally expose multiple interaction-level triggers,
such as historical steps, environment states, and task progress. Based on this
observation, we introduce AgentGhost, an effective and stealthy framework for
red-teaming backdoor attacks. Specifically, we first construct composite
triggers by combining goal and interaction levels, allowing GUI agents to
unintentionally activate backdoors while ensuring task utility. Then, we
formulate backdoor injection as a Min-Max optimization problem that uses
supervised contrastive learning to maximize the feature difference across
sample classes at the representation space, improving flexibility of the
backdoor. Meanwhile, it adopts supervised fine-tuning to minimize the
discrepancy between backdoor and clean behavior generation, enhancing
effectiveness and utility. Extensive evaluations of various agent models in two
established mobile benchmarks show that AgentGhost is effective and generic,
with attack accuracy that reaches 99.7\% on three attack objectives, and shows
stealthiness with only 1\% utility degradation. Furthermore, we tailor a
defense method against AgentGhost that reduces the attack accuracy to 22.1\%.

Conclusion: 神经不兼容性是跨规模PKT的根本挑战，为LLM参数架构研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transparent brain with accessible
parameters that encode extensive knowledge, which can be analyzed, located and
transferred. Consequently, a key research challenge is to transcend traditional
knowledge transfer paradigms rooted in symbolic language and achieve genuine
Parametric Knowledge Transfer (PKT). Significantly, exploring effective methods
for transferring knowledge across LLMs of different scales through parameters
presents an intriguing and valuable research direction. In this paper, we first
demonstrate $\textbf{Alignment}$ in parametric space is the fundamental
prerequisite to achieve successful cross-scale PKT. We redefine the previously
explored knowledge transfer as Post-Align PKT (PostPKT), which utilizes
extracted parameters for LoRA initialization and requires subsequent fine-tune
for alignment. Hence, to reduce cost for further fine-tuning, we introduce a
novel Pre-Align PKT (PrePKT) paradigm and propose a solution called
$\textbf{LaTen}$
($\textbf{L}$oc$\textbf{a}$te-$\textbf{T}$h$\textbf{e}$n-Alig$\textbf{n}$) that
aligns the parametric spaces of LLMs across scales only using several training
steps without following training. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmarks
demonstrate that both PostPKT and PrePKT face challenges in achieving
consistently stable transfer. Through in-depth analysis, we identify
$\textbf{Neural Incompatibility}$ as the ethological and parametric structural
differences between LLMs of varying scales, presenting fundamental challenges
to achieving effective PKT. These findings provide fresh insights into the
parametric architectures of LLMs and highlight promising directions for future
research on efficient PKT. Our code is available at

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance

Preference Optimization (CrPO), a novel alignment method that injects signals
from multiple creativity dimensions into the preference optimization objective
in a modular fashion. We train and evaluate creativity-augmented versions of
several models using CrPO and MuCE, a new large-scale human preference dataset
spanning over 200,000 human-generated responses and ratings from more than 30
psychological creativity assessments. Our models outperform strong baselines,
including GPT-4o, on both automated and human evaluations, producing more
novel, diverse, and surprising generations while maintaining high output
quality. Additional evaluations on NoveltyBench further confirm the
generalizability of our approach. Together, our results demonstrate that
directly optimizing for creativity within preference frameworks is a promising
direction for advancing the creative capabilities of LLMs without compromising

Abstract: Although autoregressive models have dominated language modeling in recent
years, there has been a growing interest in exploring alternative paradigms to
the conventional next-token prediction framework. Diffusion-based language
models have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel
generation capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are
often constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to
combine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks,
modeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete
diffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the
preceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered
by two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible
control mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed
granularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language
models. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive
framework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on
local semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a
classifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which
significantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient
post-hoc conditioning without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that CtrlDiff sets a new standard among hybrid diffusion models, narrows the
performance gap to state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches, and enables
effective conditional text generation across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为L2自适应计算（LAC）的方法，用于检测推理过程中未激活的层（称为Voids），并展示了跳过这些层可以提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于Transformer的语言模型取得了进展，但推理过程中是否所有层都被激活仍是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 使用LAC方法监控激活的L2范数变化，识别未激活层，并在指令调优的LM上分析提示处理（PP）和响应生成（RG）阶段的层激活情况。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，跳过未激活层显著提升了模型性能（如Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct在MMLU上从69.24提升到71.29）。

Conclusion: 并非所有层在推理过程中都同等重要，选择性跳过未激活层可以提升模型性能。

Abstract: Despite advances in transformer-based language models (LMs), a fundamental
question remains largely unanswered: Are all layers activated during inference?
We investigate this question by detecting unactivated layers (which we refer to
as Voids) using a non-trainable and parameter-free adaptive computation method
called L2 Adaptive Computation (LAC). We adapt LAC from its original
efficiency-focused application to trace activated layers during inference. This
method monitors changes in the L2-norm of activations to identify voids. We
analyze layer activation in instruction-tuned LMs across two phases: Prompt
Processing (PP), where we trace activated layers for each token in the input
prompts, and Response Generation (RG), where we trace activated layers for each
generated token. We further demonstrate that distinct layers are activated
during these two phases. To show the effectiveness of our method, we evaluated
three distinct instruction-tuned LMs from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families
on three benchmarks: MMLU, GPQA Diamond, and BoolQ. For example, on MMLU with a
zero-shot setting, skipping voids in Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct resulted in an
improvement from 69.24 to 71.29 while the model uses only 30% of the layers.
Similarly, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 on GPQA Diamond improved from 13.88 to
18.36 when using 70% of the layers during both the PP and RG phases. These
results show that not all layers contribute equally during inference, and that
selectively skipping most of them can improve the performance of models on
certain tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in flagging harmful
content in online communities. Yet, existing approaches for moderation require
a separate model for every community and are opaque in their decision-making,
limiting real-world adoption. We introduce Mixture of Moderation Experts
(MoMoE), a modular, cross-community framework that adds post-hoc explanations
to scalable content moderation. MoMoE orchestrates four operators -- Allocate,
Predict, Aggregate, Explain -- and is instantiated as seven
community-specialized experts (MoMoE-Community) and five norm-violation experts
(MoMoE-NormVio). On 30 unseen subreddits, the best variants obtain Micro-F1
scores of 0.72 and 0.67, respectively, matching or surpassing strong fine-tuned
baselines while consistently producing concise and reliable explanations.
Although community-specialized experts deliver the highest peak accuracy,
norm-violation experts provide steadier performance across domains. These
findings show that MoMoE yields scalable, transparent moderation without
needing per-community fine-tuning. More broadly, they suggest that lightweight,
explainable expert ensembles can guide future NLP and HCI research on
trustworthy human-AI governance of online communities.

Abstract: Currently, most multimodal studies are based on large language models (LLMs)
with quadratic-complexity Transformer architectures. While linear models like
RNNs enjoy low inference costs, their application has been largely limited to
the text-only modality. This work explores the capabilities of modern RNN
architectures in multimodal contexts. We propose ModRWKV-a decoupled multimodal
framework built upon the RWKV7 architecture as its LLM backbone-which achieves
multi-source information fusion through dynamically adaptable heterogeneous
modality encoders. We designed the multimodal modules in ModRWKV with an
extremely lightweight architecture and, through extensive experiments,
identified a configuration that achieves an optimal balance between performance
and computational efficiency. ModRWKV leverages the pretrained weights of the
RWKV7 LLM for initialization, which significantly accelerates multimodal
training. Comparative experiments with different pretrained checkpoints further
demonstrate that such initialization plays a crucial role in enhancing the
model's ability to understand multimodal signals. Supported by extensive
experiments, we conclude that modern RNN architectures present a viable
alternative to Transformers in the domain of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Furthermore, we identify the optimal configuration of the ModRWKV
architecture through systematic exploration.

Motivation: 尽管现有方法可以减轻LLM的有害输出，但它们通常容易被绕过。本研究旨在通过更精细的因果干预方法提升LLM的安全性。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）识别毒性相关方向，并通过解码器向量进行激活引导。实验在GPT-2 Small和Gemma-2-2B上进行，评估了不同引导强度的效果。

Result: 在较强引导强度下，毒性降低高达20%，但语言流畅性可能下降。标准NLP基准分数保持稳定，表明模型知识未受影响。

Conclusion: SAE为基础的因果干预在LLM去毒方面具有潜力，但需注意特征解耦的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in user-facing applications,
yet they still generate undesirable toxic outputs, including profanity,
vulgarity, and derogatory remarks. Although numerous detoxification methods
exist, most apply broad, surface-level fixes and can therefore easily be
circumvented by jailbreak attacks. In this paper we leverage sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify toxicity-related directions in the residual
stream of models and perform targeted activation steering using the
corresponding decoder vectors. We introduce three tiers of steering
aggressiveness and evaluate them on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2-2B, revealing
trade-offs between toxicity reduction and language fluency. At stronger
steering strengths, these causal interventions surpass competitive baselines in
reducing toxicity by up to 20%, though fluency can degrade noticeably on GPT-2
Small depending on the aggressiveness. Crucially, standard NLP benchmark scores
upon steering remain stable, indicating that the model's knowledge and general
abilities are preserved. We further show that feature-splitting in wider SAEs
hampers safety interventions, underscoring the importance of disentangled
feature learning. Our findings highlight both the promise and the current
limitations of SAE-based causal interventions for LLM detoxification, further
suggesting practical guidelines for safer language-model deployment.

length on model performance. We expect KORGym to become a valuable resource for
advancing LLM reasoning research and developing evaluation methodologies suited

Method: 提出Prune-on-Logic框架，将长思维链转为逻辑图，基于自验证约束剪枝低效步骤，分析三种剪枝策略（全链、核心推理、验证）。

Result: 验证步骤剪枝显著提升准确性并降低成本，而推理或全链剪枝会降低性能，表明小模型需语义更简洁的思维链。

Conclusion: 剪枝是优化思维链推理与小模型能力对齐的结构性策略。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning improves accuracy in LLMs, yet its
verbose, self-reflective style often hinders effective distillation into small
language models (SLMs). We revisit Long-CoT compression through the lens of
capability alignment and ask: Can pruning improve reasoning? We propose
Prune-on-Logic, a structure-aware framework that transforms Long-CoT into logic
graphs and selectively prunes low-utility reasoning steps under
self-verification constraints. Through systematic analysis across three pruning
strategies -- targeting entire chains, core reasoning, and verification -- we
find that pruning verification steps yields consistent accuracy gains while
reducing inference cost, outperforming token-level baselines and uncompressed
fine-tuning. In contrast, pruning reasoning or all-chain steps degrades
performance, revealing that small models benefit not from shorter CoTs, but
from semantically leaner ones. Our findings highlight pruning as a structural
optimization strategy for aligning CoT reasoning with SLM capacity.

Conclusion: 通过上下文完整性框架和强化学习，论文成功解决了LLMs的安全和隐私问题，同时提升了推理能力。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, they also
introduce significant safety and privacy risks. Current mitigation strategies
often fail to preserve contextual reasoning capabilities in risky scenarios.
Instead, they rely heavily on sensitive pattern matching to protect LLMs, which
limits the scope. Furthermore, they overlook established safety and privacy
standards, leading to systemic risks for legal compliance. To address these
gaps, we formulate safety and privacy issues into contextualized compliance
problems following the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory. Under the CI
framework, we align our model with three critical regulatory standards: GDPR,
EU AI Act, and HIPAA. Specifically, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) with
a rule-based reward to incentivize contextual reasoning capabilities while
enhancing compliance with safety and privacy norms. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our method not only significantly enhances
legal compliance (achieving a +17.64% accuracy improvement in safety/privacy
benchmarks) but also further improves general reasoning capability. For
OpenThinker-7B, a strong reasoning model that significantly outperforms its
base model Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct across diverse subjects, our method enhances its
general reasoning capabilities, with +2.05% and +8.98% accuracy improvement on
the MMLU and LegalBench benchmark, respectively.

Conclusion: 增强代码敏感性可有效提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Code Sensitivity refers to the ability of Code LLMs to recognize and respond
to details changes in problem descriptions. While current code benchmarks and
instruction data focus on difficulty and diversity, sensitivity is overlooked.
We first introduce the CTF-Code benchmark, constructed using counterfactual
perturbations, minimizing input changes while maximizing output changes. The
evaluation shows that many LLMs have a more than 10\% performance drop compared
to the original problems. To fully utilize sensitivity, CTF-Instruct, an
incremental instruction fine-tuning framework, extends on existing data and
uses a selection mechanism to meet the three dimensions of difficulty,
diversity, and sensitivity. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned with
CTF-Instruct data achieve over a 2\% improvement on CTF-Code, and more than a
10\% performance boost on LiveCodeBench, validating the feasibility of
enhancing LLMs' sensitivity to improve performance.

Abstract: User authorization-based access privileges are a key feature in many
safety-critical systems, but have thus far been absent from the large language
model (LLM) realm. In this work, drawing inspiration from such access control
systems, we introduce sudoLLM, a novel framework that results in multi-role
aligned LLMs, i.e., LLMs that account for, and behave in accordance with, user
access rights. sudoLLM injects subtle user-based biases into queries and trains
an LLM to utilize this bias signal in order to produce sensitive information if
and only if the user is authorized. We present empirical results demonstrating
that this approach shows substantially improved alignment, generalization, and
resistance to prompt-based jailbreaking attacks. The persistent tension between
the language modeling objective and safety alignment, which is often exploited
to jailbreak LLMs, is somewhat resolved with the aid of the injected bias
signal. Our framework is meant as an additional security layer, and complements
existing guardrail mechanisms for enhanced end-to-end safety with LLMs.

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) sometimes alter their behavior

introduce a white-box probing framework that (i) linearly identifies
awareness-related activations and (ii) steers models toward or away from test
awareness while monitoring downstream performance. We apply our method to
different state-of-the-art open-source reasoning LLMs across both realistic and
hypothetical tasks. Our results demonstrate that test awareness significantly
impact safety alignment, and is different for different models. By providing
fine-grained control over this latent effect, our work aims to increase trust

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown substantially improved
reasoning capabilities over traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) by
incorporating extended thinking processes prior to producing final responses.
However, excessively lengthy thinking introduces substantial overhead in terms
of token consumption and latency, which is particularly unnecessary for simple
queries. In this work, we introduce Large Hybrid-Reasoning Models (LHRMs), the
first kind of model capable of adaptively determining whether to perform
thinking based on the contextual information of user queries. To achieve this,
we propose a two-stage training pipeline comprising Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) as
a cold start, followed by online reinforcement learning with the proposed
Hybrid Group Policy Optimization (HGPO) to implicitly learn to select the
appropriate thinking mode. Furthermore, we introduce a metric called Hybrid
Accuracy to quantitatively assess the model's capability for hybrid thinking.
Extensive experimental results show that LHRMs can adaptively perform hybrid
thinking on queries of varying difficulty and type. It outperforms existing
LRMs and LLMs in reasoning and general capabilities while significantly
improving efficiency. Together, our work advocates for a reconsideration of the
appropriate use of extended thinking processes and provides a solid starting

Conclusion: 识别AI模型的价值优先级可有效预测其潜在风险行为，为AI安全提供早期预警。

Abstract: Detecting AI risks becomes more challenging as stronger models emerge and
find novel methods such as Alignment Faking to circumvent these detection
attempts. Inspired by how risky behaviors in humans (i.e., illegal activities
that may hurt others) are sometimes guided by strongly-held values, we believe
that identifying values within AI models can be an early warning system for
AI's risky behaviors. We create LitmusValues, an evaluation pipeline to reveal
AI models' priorities on a range of AI value classes. Then, we collect
AIRiskDilemmas, a diverse collection of dilemmas that pit values against one
another in scenarios relevant to AI safety risks such as Power Seeking. By
measuring an AI model's value prioritization using its aggregate choices, we
obtain a self-consistent set of predicted value priorities that uncover
potential risks. We show that values in LitmusValues (including seemingly
innocuous ones like Care) can predict for both seen risky behaviors in
AIRiskDilemmas and unseen risky behaviors in HarmBench.

Conclusion: General-Reasoner为LLM跨领域推理提供了有效解决方案，同时保持数学推理任务的高效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently demonstrated strong potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero,
enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate
supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM
reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data
abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability
and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often
have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we
propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM
reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include:
(1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with
verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of
disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which
replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of
chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and
evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics,
chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these
12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC)
demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods,
achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining
superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.

In this work, we introduce Reward Reasoning Models (RRMs), which are
specifically designed to execute a deliberate reasoning process before

additional test-time compute for complex queries where appropriate rewards are
not immediately apparent. To develop RRMs, we implement a reinforcement
learning framework that fosters self-evolved reward reasoning capabilities
without requiring explicit reasoning traces as training data. Experimental

TL;DR: ULTRAEDIT是一种新型的模型编辑方法，通过轻量级线性代数操作实现快速、高效的参数修改，适用于大规模终身学习场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 终身学习需要LLMs能够高效更新知识而不损害现有能力，现有方法难以满足实际需求。

Method: 提出ULTRAEDIT，一种无训练、无主题、无记忆的编辑方法，通过线性代数操作计算参数偏移，并采用终身归一化策略适应分布变化。

Result: ULTRAEDIT编辑速度比现有最快方法快7倍，VRAM消耗减少2/3，支持百万级编辑并保持高准确性。

Conclusion: ULTRAEDIT在多种模型编辑场景中表现优异，是首个能在消费级GPU上编辑7B LLM的方法。

Abstract: Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving
information by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system
should support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing
capabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a
promising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to
revise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made
notable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong
adaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose ULTRAEDIT-a fundamentally
new editing solution that is training-, subject- and memory-free, making it
particularly well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing.
ULTRAEDIT performs editing through a self-contained process that relies solely
on lightweight linear algebra operations to compute parameter shifts, enabling
fast and consistent parameter modifications with minimal overhead. To improve
scalability in lifelong settings, ULTRAEDIT employs a lifelong normalization
strategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it
to adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. ULTRAEDIT
achieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art
method-which was also the fastest known approach-while consuming less than 1/3
the VRAM, making it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a
24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct ULTRAEDITBENCH-the largest
dataset in the field to date, with over 2M editing pairs-and demonstrate that
our method supports up to 1M edits while maintaining high accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments on four datasets and six models show that ULTRAEDIT
consistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing
scenarios. Our code is available at: https://github.com/XiaojieGu/UltraEdit.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on
mathemati-cal tasks through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, existing
mathematical CoT datasets often suffer from Thought Leaps due to experts
omitting intermediate steps, which negatively impacts model learning and
generalization. We propose the CoT Thought Leap Bridge Task, which aims to
automatically detect leaps and generate missing intermediate reasoning steps to
restore the completeness and coherence of CoT. To facilitate this, we
constructed a specialized training dataset called ScaleQM+, based on the
structured ScaleQuestMath dataset, and trained CoT-Bridge to bridge thought
leaps. Through comprehensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks,
we demonstrate that models fine-tuned on bridged datasets consistently
outperform those trained on original datasets, with improvements of up to
+5.87% on NuminaMath. Our approach effectively enhances distilled data (+3.02%)
and provides better starting points for reinforcement learning (+3.1%),
functioning as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing optimization
techniques. Furthermore, CoT-Bridge demonstrate improved generalization to
out-of-domain logical reasoning tasks, confirming that enhancing reasoning
completeness yields broadly applicable benefits.

Conclusion: 为逆向工程LMs中的ToM推理提供了初步见解。

Abstract: How do language models (LMs) represent characters' beliefs, especially when
those beliefs may differ from reality? This question lies at the heart of
understanding the Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities of LMs. We analyze
Llama-3-70B-Instruct's ability to reason about characters' beliefs using causal
mediation and abstraction. We construct a dataset that consists of simple
stories where two characters each separately change the state of two objects,
potentially unaware of each other's actions. Our investigation uncovered a
pervasive algorithmic pattern that we call a lookback mechanism, which enables
the LM to recall important information when it becomes necessary. The LM binds
each character-object-state triple together by co-locating reference
information about them, represented as their Ordering IDs (OIs) in low rank
subspaces of the state token's residual stream. When asked about a character's
beliefs regarding the state of an object, the binding lookback retrieves the
corresponding state OI and then an answer lookback retrieves the state token.
When we introduce text specifying that one character is (not) visible to the
other, we find that the LM first generates a visibility ID encoding the
relation between the observing and the observed character OIs. In a visibility
lookback, this ID is used to retrieve information about the observed character
and update the observing character's beliefs. Our work provides insights into
the LM's belief tracking mechanisms, taking a step toward reverse-engineering
ToM reasoning in LMs.

Abstract: Content moderation for large language models (LLMs) remains a significant
challenge, requiring flexible and adaptable solutions that can quickly respond
to emerging threats. This paper introduces Retrieval Augmented Rejection (RAR),
a novel approach that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
architecture to dynamically reject unsafe user queries without model

vector database, the system can identify and reject harmful requests when these
documents are retrieved. Our preliminary results show that RAR achieves
comparable performance to embedded moderation in LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet,

Conclusion: 提出的搜索策略显著提升了LLMs在非序列化环境中的性能，且具有通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable results in
complex multi-step tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and agentic software
engineering. However, they often struggle to maintain consistent performance
across multiple solution attempts. One effective approach to narrow the gap
between average-case and best-case performance is guided test-time search,
which explores multiple solution paths to identify the most promising one.
Unfortunately, effective search techniques (e.g. MCTS) are often unsuitable for
non-serializable RL environments, such as Docker containers, where intermediate
environment states cannot be easily saved and restored. We investigate two
complementary search strategies applicable to such environments: 1-step
lookahead and trajectory selection, both guided by a learned action-value
function estimator. On the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, a key testbed for
agentic software engineering, we find these methods to double the average
success rate of a fine-tuned Qwen-72B model, achieving 40.8%, the new
state-of-the-art for open-weights models. Additionally, we show that these
techniques are transferable to more advanced closed models, yielding similar
improvements with GPT-4o.

Conclusion: PandaGuard为LLM安全研究提供了透明、可复现的工具和基准，揭示了模型脆弱性和防御成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities but remain
vulnerable to adversarial prompts known as jailbreaks, which can bypass safety
alignment and elicit harmful outputs. Despite growing efforts in LLM safety
research, existing evaluations are often fragmented, focused on isolated attack
or defense techniques, and lack systematic, reproducible analysis. In this
work, we introduce PandaGuard, a unified and modular framework that models LLM
jailbreak safety as a multi-agent system comprising attackers, defenders, and
judges. Our framework implements 19 attack methods and 12 defense mechanisms,
along with multiple judgment strategies, all within a flexible plugin
architecture supporting diverse LLM interfaces, multiple interaction modes, and
configuration-driven experimentation that enhances reproducibility and
practical deployment. Built on this framework, we develop PandaBench, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the interactions between these
attack/defense methods across 49 LLMs and various judgment approaches,
requiring over 3 billion tokens to execute. Our extensive evaluation reveals
key insights into model vulnerabilities, defense cost-performance trade-offs,
and judge consistency. We find that no single defense is optimal across all
dimensions and that judge disagreement introduces nontrivial variance in safety
assessments. We release the code, configurations, and evaluation results to
support transparent and reproducible research in LLM safety.

Result: 催眠攻击对对齐模型（如Stablelm2、Mistral等）攻击成功率达90%，忽略前缀攻击对14种LLM攻击成功率达60%。

Conclusion: 开源LLM对提示注入攻击高度脆弱，需提高公众意识并优先制定缓解策略。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable
to different prompt-based attacks, generating harmful content or sensitive
information. Both closed-source and open-source LLMs are underinvestigated for
these attacks. This paper studies effective prompt injection attacks against
the $\mathbf{14}$ most popular open-source LLMs on five attack benchmarks.
Current metrics only consider successful attacks, whereas our proposed Attack
Success Probability (ASP) also captures uncertainty in the model's response,
reflecting ambiguity in attack feasibility. By comprehensively analyzing the
effectiveness of prompt injection attacks, we propose a simple and effective
hypnotism attack; results show that this attack causes aligned language models,
including Stablelm2, Mistral, Openchat, and Vicuna, to generate objectionable
behaviors, achieving around $90$% ASP. They also indicate that our ignore
prefix attacks can break all $\mathbf{14}$ open-source LLMs, achieving over
$60$% ASP on a multi-categorical dataset. We find that moderately well-known
LLMs exhibit higher vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, highlighting the
need to raise public awareness and prioritize efficient mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: 结合NMT和LLM的调度策略是一种高效且实用的翻译解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) shows promising performances in a variety of
downstream tasks, such as machine translation (MT). However, using LLMs for
translation suffers from high computational costs and significant latency.
Based on our evaluation, in most cases, translations using LLMs are comparable
to that generated by neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Only in
particular scenarios, LLM and NMT models show respective advantages. As a
result, integrating NMT and LLM for translation and using LLM only when
necessary seems to be a sound solution. A scheduling policy that optimizes
translation result while ensuring fast speed and as little LLM usage as
possible is thereby required. We compare several scheduling policies and
propose a novel and straightforward decider that leverages source sentence
features. We conduct extensive experiments on multilingual test sets and the
result shows that we can achieve optimal translation performance with minimal
LLM usage, demonstrating effectiveness of our decider.

Malay-English (EN-MS), with 900-1300 human-annotated dialogues per language
pair. Evaluating ten LLMs, including open and closed-source models, we analyze
performance across few-shot, translate-summarize, and fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA
on synthetic data) approaches. Our findings show that though the scores on
automated metrics are high, LLMs make subtle mistakes that alter the complete
meaning of the dialogue. To this end, we introduce 3 most common type of errors
that LLMs make when handling CS input. Error rates vary across CS pairs and
LLMs, with some LLMs showing more frequent errors on certain language pairs,

Abstract: Visual-language Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data resources are relatively scarce

Models (LLMs) to adapt game code, enabling automatic acquisition of reasoning
processes and results through code execution. Using the Code2Logic approach, we

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in
mathematical reasoning. To enable such capabilities, many existing works
distill strong reasoning models into long chains of thought or design
algorithms to construct high-quality math QA data for training. However, these
efforts primarily focus on generating correct reasoning paths and answers,
while largely overlooking the validity of the questions themselves. In this
work, we propose Math Question Verification (MathQ-Verify), a novel five-stage
pipeline designed to rigorously filter ill-posed or under-specified math
problems. MathQ-Verify first performs format-level validation to remove
redundant instructions and ensure that each question is syntactically
well-formed. It then formalizes each question, decomposes it into atomic
conditions, and verifies them against mathematical definitions. Next, it
detects logical contradictions among these conditions, followed by a
goal-oriented completeness check to ensure the question provides sufficient
information for solving. To evaluate this task, we use existing benchmarks
along with an additional dataset we construct, containing 2,147 math questions
with diverse error types, each manually double-validated. Experiments show that
MathQ-Verify achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks,
improving the F1 score by up to 25 percentage points over the direct
verification baseline. It further attains approximately 90% precision and 63%
recall through a lightweight model voting scheme. MathQ-Verify offers a
scalable and accurate solution for curating reliable mathematical datasets,
reducing label noise and avoiding unnecessary computation on invalid questions.

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)-based tuning has shifted the trajectory

applying it to medical tasks remains challenging for achieving clinically
grounded model behavior. Motivated by the need to align model response with
clinical expectations, we investigate four critical dimensions that affect the
effectiveness of RL-based tuning in medical visual question answering (VQA):
base model initialization strategy, the role of medical semantic alignment, the
impact of length-based rewards on long-chain reasoning, and the influence of
bias. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze these factors for medical
MLLMs, providing new insights into how models are domain-specifically
fine-tuned. Additionally, our results also demonstrate that GRPO-based RL
tuning consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both
accuracy and reasoning quality.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of domain-specific large language models (LLMs) in
fields like law necessitates frameworks that account for nuanced regional legal
distinctions, which are critical for ensuring compliance and trustworthiness.
Existing legal evaluation benchmarks often lack adaptability and fail to
address diverse local contexts, limiting their utility in dynamically evolving
regulatory landscapes. To address these gaps, we propose AutoLaw, a novel
violation detection framework that combines adversarial data generation with a
jury-inspired deliberation process to enhance legal compliance of LLMs. Unlike
static approaches, AutoLaw dynamically synthesizes case law to reflect local
regulations and employs a pool of LLM-based "jurors" to simulate judicial
decision-making. Jurors are ranked and selected based on synthesized legal
expertise, enabling a deliberation process that minimizes bias and improves
detection accuracy. Evaluations across three benchmarks: Law-SG, Case-SG
(legality), and Unfair-TOS (policy), demonstrate AutoLaw's effectiveness:
adversarial data generation improves LLM discrimination, while the jury-based
voting strategy significantly boosts violation detection rates. Our results
highlight the framework's ability to adaptively probe legal misalignments and
deliver reliable, context-aware judgments, offering a scalable solution for
evaluating and enhancing LLMs in legally sensitive applications.

models like R1 or o3-mini. However, existing pruning methods often lead to
significant performance degradation or require extensive retraining and
fine-tuning. This technique aims to identify and remove neurons, connections
unlikely leading to the contribution during the human-computer interaction
phase. Our goal is to obtain a much smaller and faster knowledge distilled
model that can quickly generate content almost as good as those of the unpruned
ones. We propose MAMA Pruning, short for Movement and Magnitude Analysis, an
improved pruning method that effectively reduces model size and computational
complexity while maintaining performance comparable to the original unpruned
model even at extreme pruned levels. The improved method is based on weights,
bias fixed in the pre-training phase and GRPO rewards verified during the
post-training phase as our novel pruning indicators. Preliminary experimental
results show that our method outperforms and be comparable to state-of-the-art
methods across various pruning levels and different downstream computational
linguistics tasks.

Motivation: 解决LLM在KBQA任务中存在的知识过时、幻觉和透明度不足问题，以及现有KG-RAG方法对复杂问题的局限性。

Method: 提出PDRR框架，包括预测问题类型、分解问题为结构化三元组、从KB检索信息，并引导LLM作为代理进行推理。

Result: PDRR在多种LLM骨干上均优于现有方法，尤其在非链式复杂问题上表现突出。

Conclusion: PDRR通过结合KB和LLM，显著提升了KBQA任务的性能，适用于复杂问题。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using structured knowledge from KBs. While LLM-only approaches offer
generalization, they suffer from outdated knowledge, hallucinations, and lack
of transparency. Chain-based KG-RAG methods address these issues by
incorporating external KBs, but are limited to simple chain-structured
questions due to the absence of planning and logical structuring. Inspired by
semantic parsing methods, we propose PDRR: a four-stage framework consisting of
Predict, Decompose, Retrieve, and Reason. Our method first predicts the
question type and decomposes the question into structured triples. Then
retrieves relevant information from KBs and guides the LLM as an agent to
reason over and complete the decomposed triples. Experimental results
demonstrate that PDRR consistently outperforms existing methods across various
LLM backbones and achieves superior performance on both chain-structured and
non-chain complex questions.

TL;DR: THOR-MoE通过分层任务引导和上下文响应路由策略改进稀疏MoE，提升了多领域和多语言翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MoE解决方案直接使用NMT的任务知识，忽略了自然分组的领域/语言特性，且专家选择仅依赖局部标记表示，未考虑全局上下文。

Method: 提出THOR-MoE，分层预测领域/语言标签并提取混合表示分配任务级专家，同时注入上下文信息增强标记路由。

Result: 在多领域和多语言翻译基准测试中表现优异，平均提升0.75 BLEU，激活参数少于22%。

Conclusion: THOR-MoE作为即插即用模块，兼容现有路由方案，适用于多样化MoE架构。

Abstract: The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has achieved significant progress for
neural machine translation (NMT). However, there exist two limitations in
current MoE solutions which may lead to sub-optimal performance: 1) they
directly use the task knowledge of NMT into MoE (\emph{e.g.},
domain/linguistics-specific knowledge), which are generally unavailable at
practical application and neglect the naturally grouped domain/linguistic
properties; 2) the expert selection only depends on the localized token
representation without considering the context, which fully grasps the state of
each token in a global view. To address the above limitations, we propose
THOR-MoE via arming the MoE with hierarchical task-guided and
context-responsive routing policies. Specifically, it 1) firstly predicts the
domain/language label and then extracts mixed domain/language representation to
allocate task-level experts in a hierarchical manner; 2) injects the context
information to enhance the token routing from the pre-selected task-level
experts set, which can help each token to be accurately routed to more
specialized and suitable experts. Extensive experiments on multi-domain
translation and multilingual translation benchmarks with different
architectures consistently demonstrate the superior performance of THOR-MoE.
Additionally, the THOR-MoE operates as a plug-and-play module compatible with
existing Top-$k$~\cite{shazeer2017} and Top-$p$~\cite{huang-etal-2024-harder}
routing schemes, ensuring broad applicability across diverse MoE architectures.
For instance, compared with vanilla Top-$p$~\cite{huang-etal-2024-harder}
routing, the context-aware manner can achieve an average improvement of 0.75
BLEU with less than 22\% activated parameters on multi-domain translation
tasks.

Motivation: 传统监督微调（SFT）在多语言环境中过度依赖英语性能，尤其在数据受限时表现不佳。CLO旨在解决这一问题，实现高效跨语言迁移。

Method: CLO结合公开英语SFT数据和翻译模型，通过跨语言优化策略进行模型迁移。实验在五种模型和六种语言上进行，涵盖不同资源水平。

Result: CLO在目标语言能力和英语性能保留上均优于SFT，尤其在低资源语言中仅需一半数据即可超越SFT。SFT对数据量敏感，而CLO表现稳健。

Conclusion: CLO是一种高效的多语言迁移方法，显著优于传统SFT，尤其在数据受限环境中。

Abstract: Adapting large language models to other languages typically employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a standard approach. However, it often suffers
from an overemphasis on English performance, a phenomenon that is especially
pronounced in data-constrained environments. To overcome these challenges, we
propose \textbf{Cross-Lingual Optimization (CLO)} that efficiently transfers an
English-centric LLM to a target language while preserving its English
capabilities. CLO utilizes publicly available English SFT data and a
translation model to enable cross-lingual transfer. We conduct experiments
using five models on six languages, each possessing varying levels of resource.
Our results show that CLO consistently outperforms SFT in both acquiring target
language proficiency and maintaining English performance. Remarkably, in
low-resource languages, CLO with only 3,200 samples surpasses SFT with 6,400
samples, demonstrating that CLO can achieve better performance with less data.
Furthermore, we find that SFT is particularly sensitive to data quantity in
medium and low-resource languages, whereas CLO remains robust. Our
comprehensive analysis emphasizes the limitations of SFT and incorporates
additional training strategies in CLO to enhance efficiency.

Conclusion: 检索机制在语言模型预训练中存在显著优化潜力，合成上下文是有效策略。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented language models have demonstrated performance comparable
to much larger models while requiring fewer computational resources. The
effectiveness of these models crucially depends on the overlap between query
and retrieved context, but the optimal degree of this overlap remains
unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate how varying levels of
query--context overlap affect model performance during both training and
inference. Our experiments reveal that increased overlap initially has minimal
effect, but substantially improves test-time perplexity and accelerates model
learning above a critical threshold. Building on these findings, we demonstrate
that deliberately increasing overlap through synthetic context can enhance data
efficiency and reduce training time by approximately 40\% without compromising
performance. We specifically generate synthetic context through paraphrasing
queries. We validate our perplexity-based findings on question-answering tasks,
confirming that the benefits of retrieval-augmented language modeling extend to
practical applications. Our results provide empirical evidence of significant
optimization potential for retrieval mechanisms in language model pretraining.

Abstract: Generating a review for an academic research paper is a complex task that
requires a deep understanding of the document's content and the
interdependencies between its sections. It demands not only insight into
technical details but also an appreciation of the paper's overall coherence and
structure. Recent methods have predominantly focused on fine-tuning large
language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. However, they often overlook
the computational and performance limitations imposed by long input token
lengths. To address this, we introduce AutoRev, an Automatic Peer Review System
for Academic Research Papers. Our novel framework represents an academic
document as a graph, enabling the extraction of the most critical passages that
contribute significantly to the review. This graph-based approach demonstrates
effectiveness for review generation and is potentially adaptable to various
downstream tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and document
representation. When applied to review generation, our method outperforms SOTA
baselines by an average of 58.72% across all evaluation metrics. We hope that
our work will stimulate further research in applying graph-based extraction
techniques to other downstream tasks in NLP. We plan to make our code public
upon acceptance.

Conclusion: MCIP框架和配套工具能有效提升LLMs在MCP环境中的安全性。

Abstract: As Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces an easy-to-use ecosystem for users
and developers, it also brings underexplored safety risks. Its decentralized
architecture, which separates clients and servers, poses unique challenges for
systematic safety analysis. This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance
MCP safety. Guided by the MAESTRO framework, we first analyze the missing
safety mechanisms in MCP, and based on this analysis, we propose the Model
Contextual Integrity Protocol (MCIP), a refined version of MCP that addresses
these gaps.Next, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy that captures a diverse
range of unsafe behaviors observed in MCP scenarios. Building on this taxonomy,
we develop benchmark and training data that support the evaluation and
improvement of LLMs' capabilities in identifying safety risks within MCP
interactions. Leveraging the proposed benchmark and training data, we conduct
extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs. The results highlight LLMs'
vulnerabilities in MCP interactions and demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves their safety performance.

Conclusion: KnowHD可加速科学发现，提升LLMs在生物医学领域的实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in scientific
disciplines such as biomedicine, particularly in hypothesis generation, where
they can analyze vast literature, identify patterns, and suggest research
directions. However, a key challenge lies in evaluating the truthfulness of
generated hypotheses, as verifying their accuracy often requires substantial
time and resources. Additionally, the hallucination problem in LLMs can lead to
the generation of hypotheses that appear plausible but are ultimately
incorrect, undermining their reliability. To facilitate the systematic study of
these challenges, we introduce TruthHypo, a benchmark for assessing the
capabilities of LLMs in generating truthful biomedical hypotheses, and KnowHD,
a knowledge-based hallucination detector to evaluate how well hypotheses are
grounded in existing knowledge. Our results show that LLMs struggle to generate
truthful hypotheses. By analyzing hallucinations in reasoning steps, we
demonstrate that the groundedness scores provided by KnowHD serve as an
effective metric for filtering truthful hypotheses from the diverse outputs of
LLMs. Human evaluations further validate the utility of KnowHD in identifying
truthful hypotheses and accelerating scientific discovery. Our data and source
code are available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/TruthHypo.

Conclusion: 结论强调避免依赖机器文本检测，支持先前建议。

Abstract: Despite considerable progress in the development of machine-text detectors,
it has been suggested that the problem is inherently hard, and therefore, that
stakeholders should proceed under the assumption that machine-generated text
cannot be reliably detected as such. We examine a recent such claim by Nicks et
al. (2024) regarding the ease with which language models can be optimized to
degrade the performance of machine-text detectors, including detectors not
specifically optimized against. We identify a feature space$\unicode{x2013}$the
stylistic feature space$\unicode{x2013}$that is robust to such optimization,
and show that it may be used to reliably detect samples from language models
optimized to prevent detection. Furthermore, we show that even when models are
explicitly optimized against stylistic detectors, detection performance remains
surprisingly unaffected. We then seek to understand if stylistic detectors are
inherently more robust. To study this question, we explore a new paraphrasing
approach that simultaneously aims to close the gap between human writing and
machine writing in stylistic feature space while avoiding detection using
traditional features. We show that when only a single sample is available for
detection, this attack is universally effective across all detectors
considered, including those that use writing style. However, as the number of
samples available for detection grows, the human and machine distributions
become distinguishable. This observation encourages us to introduce AURA, a
metric that estimates the overlap between human and machine-generated
distributions by analyzing how detector performance improves as more samples
become available. Overall, our findings underscore previous recommendations to
avoid reliance on machine-text detection.

Conclusion: 信息提取在科学检索重排序中具有重要价值，CoRank框架为LLM重排序提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific retrieval is essential for advancing academic discovery. Within
this process, document reranking plays a critical role by refining first-stage
retrieval results. However, large language model (LLM) listwise reranking faces
unique challenges in the scientific domain. First-stage retrieval is often
suboptimal in the scientific domain, so relevant documents are ranked lower.
Moreover, conventional listwise reranking uses the full text of candidate
documents in the context window, limiting the number of candidates that can be
considered. As a result, many relevant documents are excluded before reranking,
which constrains overall retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we
explore compact document representations based on semantic features such as
categories, sections, and keywords, and propose a training-free, model-agnostic
reranking framework for scientific retrieval called CoRank. The framework
involves three stages: (i) offline extraction of document-level features, (ii)
coarse reranking using these compact representations, and (iii) fine-grained
reranking on full texts of the top candidates from stage (ii). This hybrid
design provides a high-level abstraction of document semantics, expands
candidate coverage, and retains critical details required for precise ranking.
Experiments on LitSearch and CSFCube show that CoRank significantly improves
reranking performance across different LLM backbones, increasing nDCG@10 from
32.0 to 39.7. Overall, these results highlight the value of information
extraction for reranking in scientific retrieval.

cultural bias, restrict evaluation to text-only, rely on multiple-choice

English and Irish, which is considered definitely endangered by UNESCO. Our
benchmark consists of 12 representative subjects developed from the 2024 Irish
Leaving Certificate exams, enabling fine-grained analysis of model capabilities
across domains. By framing the task as long-form generation and leveraging the
official marking scheme, it does not only support a comprehensive evaluation of
correctness but also language fidelity. Our extensive experiments of leading
closed-source and open-source LLMs reveal a persistent performance gap between
English and Irish, in which models produce valid Irish responses less than 80\%

Conversely, large language models (LLMs) provide intuitive, language-based
interactions but can lack the structured, causal understanding required to
reliably model complex real-world dynamics. We introduce our simulation agent
framework, a novel approach that integrates the strengths of both simulation
models and LLMs. This framework helps empower users by leveraging the
conversational capabilities of LLMs to interact seamlessly with sophisticated
simulation systems, while simultaneously utilizing the simulations to ground
the LLMs in accurate and structured representations of real-world phenomena.
This integrated approach helps provide a robust and generalizable foundation
for empirical validation and offers broad applicability across diverse domains.

Abstract: Associative memory engages in the integration of relevant information for
comprehension in the human cognition system. In this work, we seek to improve
alignment between language models and human brain while processing speech
information by integrating associative memory. After verifying the alignment
between language model and brain by mapping language model activations to brain
activity, the original text stimuli expanded with simulated associative memory
are regarded as input to computational language models. We find the alignment
between language model and brain is improved in brain regions closely related
to associative memory processing. We also demonstrate large language models
after specific supervised fine-tuning better align with brain response, by
building the \textit{Association} dataset containing 1000 samples of stories,
with instructions encouraging associative memory as input and associated
content as output.

Abstract: Memory-based approaches have shown strong performance in Continual Relation
Extraction (CRE). However, storing examples from previous tasks increases
memory usage and raises privacy concerns. Recently, prompt-based methods have
emerged as a promising alternative, as they do not rely on storing past
samples. Despite this progress, current prompt-based techniques face several
core challenges in CRE, particularly in accurately identifying task identities
and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing prompt selection strategies
often suffer from inaccuracies, lack robust mechanisms to prevent forgetting in
shared parameters, and struggle to handle both cross-task and within-task
variations. In this paper, we propose WAVE++, a novel approach inspired by the
connection between prefix-tuning and mixture of experts. Specifically, we
introduce task-specific prompt pools that enhance flexibility and adaptability
across diverse tasks while avoiding boundary-spanning risks; this design more
effectively captures variations within each task and across tasks. To further
refine relation classification, we incorporate label descriptions that provide
richer, more global context, enabling the model to better distinguish among
different relations. We also propose a training-free mechanism to improve task
prediction during inference. Moreover, we integrate a generative model to
consolidate prior knowledge within the shared parameters, thereby removing the
need for explicit data storage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WAVE++
outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-based and rehearsal-based methods, offering
a more robust solution for continual relation extraction. Our code is publicly

Abstract: The emergence of groundbreaking large language models capable of performing
complex reasoning tasks holds significant promise for addressing various
scientific challenges, including those arising in complex clinical scenarios.
To enable their safe and effective deployment in real-world healthcare
settings, it is urgently necessary to benchmark the diagnostic capabilities of
current models systematically. Given the limitations of existing medical
benchmarks in evaluating advanced diagnostic reasoning, we present
DiagnosisArena, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark designed to
rigorously assess professional-level diagnostic competence. DiagnosisArena
consists of 1,113 pairs of segmented patient cases and corresponding diagnoses,
spanning 28 medical specialties, deriving from clinical case reports published
in 10 top-tier medical journals. The benchmark is developed through a
meticulous construction pipeline, involving multiple rounds of screening and
review by both AI systems and human experts, with thorough checks conducted to
prevent data leakage. Our study reveals that even the most advanced reasoning
models, o3-mini, o1, and DeepSeek-R1, achieve only 45.82%, 31.09%, and 17.79%
accuracy, respectively. This finding highlights a significant generalization
bottleneck in current large language models when faced with clinical diagnostic
reasoning challenges. Through DiagnosisArena, we aim to drive further
advancements in AIs diagnostic reasoning capabilities, enabling more effective
solutions for real-world clinical diagnostic challenges. We provide the
benchmark and evaluation tools for further research and development

Abstract: Machine translation (MT) has become indispensable for cross-border
communication in globalized industries like e-commerce, finance, and legal
services, with recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
significantly enhancing translation quality. However, applying general-purpose
MT models to industrial scenarios reveals critical limitations due to
domain-specific terminology, cultural nuances, and stylistic conventions absent
in generic benchmarks. Existing evaluation frameworks inadequately assess
performance in specialized contexts, creating a gap between academic benchmarks
and real-world efficacy. To address this, we propose a three-level translation
capability framework: (1) Basic Linguistic Competence, (2) Domain-Specific
Proficiency, and (3) Cultural Adaptation, emphasizing the need for holistic
evaluation across these dimensions. We introduce TransBench, a benchmark
tailored for industrial MT, initially targeting international e-commerce with
17,000 professionally translated sentences spanning 4 main scenarios and 33
language pairs. TransBench integrates traditional metrics (BLEU, TER) with
Marco-MOS, a domain-specific evaluation model, and provides guidelines for
reproducible benchmark construction. Our contributions include: (1) a
structured framework for industrial MT evaluation, (2) the first publicly
available benchmark for e-commerce translation, (3) novel metrics probing
multi-level translation quality, and (4) open-sourced evaluation tools. This
work bridges the evaluation gap, enabling researchers and practitioners to

improved interpretability. We incorporate an adaptation to address

Result: 发现Qwen2-Audio和Granite-Speech等模型存在关键漏洞，易受通用对抗攻击影响。

Conclusion: 语音LLMs需要更鲁棒的训练策略和对抗攻击抵抗力。

Abstract: The combination of pre-trained speech encoders with large language models has
enabled the development of speech LLMs that can handle a wide range of spoken
language processing tasks. While these models are powerful and flexible, this
very flexibility may make them more vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To
examine the extent of this problem, in this work we investigate universal
acoustic adversarial attacks on speech LLMs. Here a fixed, universal,
adversarial audio segment is prepended to the original input audio. We
initially investigate attacks that cause the model to either produce no output
or to perform a modified task overriding the original prompt. We then extend
the nature of the attack to be selective so that it activates only when
specific input attributes, such as a speaker gender or spoken language, are
present. Inputs without the targeted attribute should be unaffected, allowing
fine-grained control over the model outputs. Our findings reveal critical
vulnerabilities in Qwen2-Audio and Granite-Speech and suggest that similar
speech LLMs may be susceptible to universal adversarial attacks. This
highlights the need for more robust training strategies and improved resistance
to adversarial attacks.

synthesized data from the backbone LLM. Unlike prior approaches, our method
requires no modification to LLM parameters and efficiently integrates audio
representations via a lightweight adapter. Experiments show that LISTEN
effectively mitigates hallucinations while maintaining impressive performance
on existing audio question and reasoning benchmarks. At the same time, it is
more efficient in both data and computation.

Abstract: Suicide prevention remains a critical public health challenge. While online
platforms such as Reddit's r/SuicideWatch have historically provided spaces for
individuals to express suicidal thoughts and seek community support, the advent
of large language models (LLMs) introduces a new paradigm-where individuals may
begin disclosing ideation to AI systems instead of humans. This study evaluates
the capability of LLMs to perform automated suicide risk assessment using the
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). We assess the zero-shot
performance of six models-including Claude, GPT, Mistral, and LLaMA-in
classifying posts across a 7-point severity scale (Levels 0-6). Results
indicate that Claude and GPT closely align with human annotations, while
Mistral achieves the lowest ordinal prediction error. Most models exhibit
ordinal sensitivity, with misclassifications typically occurring between
adjacent severity levels. We further analyze confusion patterns,
misclassification sources, and ethical considerations, underscoring the
importance of human oversight, transparency, and cautious deployment. Full code

Conclusion: LLMs的语义信息能有效增强认知诊断任务，解决冷启动问题。

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis (CD) plays a crucial role in intelligent education,
evaluating students' comprehension of knowledge concepts based on their test
histories. However, current CD methods often model students, exercises, and
knowledge concepts solely on their ID relationships, neglecting the abundant
semantic relationships present within educational data space. Furthermore,
contemporary intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) frequently involve the addition
of new students and exercises, a situation that ID-based methods find
challenging to manage effectively. The advent of large language models (LLMs)
offers the potential for overcoming this challenge with open-world knowledge.
In this paper, we propose LLM4CD, which Leverages Large Language Models for
Open-World Knowledge Augmented Cognitive Diagnosis. Our method utilizes the
open-world knowledge of LLMs to construct cognitively expressive textual
representations, which are then encoded to introduce rich semantic information
into the CD task. Additionally, we propose an innovative bi-level encoder
framework that models students' test histories through two levels of encoders:
a macro-level cognitive text encoder and a micro-level knowledge state encoder.
This approach substitutes traditional ID embeddings with semantic
representations, enabling the model to accommodate new students and exercises
with open-world knowledge and address the cold-start problem. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently
outperforms previous CD models on multiple real-world datasets, validating the
effectiveness of leveraging LLMs to introduce rich semantic information into
the CD task.

Abstract: Legal rules encompass not only codified statutes but also implicit
adjudicatory principles derived from precedents that contain discretionary
norms, social morality, and policy. While computational legal research has
advanced in applying established rules to cases, inducing legal rules from
judicial decisions remains understudied, constrained by limitations in model
inference efficacy and symbolic reasoning capability. The advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities for automating the
extraction of such latent principles, yet progress is stymied by the absence of
formal task definitions, benchmark datasets, and methodologies. To address this
gap, we formalize Legal Rule Induction (LRI) as the task of deriving concise,
generalizable doctrinal rules from sets of analogous precedents, distilling
their shared preconditions, normative behaviors, and legal consequences. We
introduce the first LRI benchmark, comprising 5,121 case sets (38,088 Chinese
cases in total) for model tuning and 216 expert-annotated gold test sets.
Experimental results reveal that: 1) State-of-the-art LLMs struggle with
over-generalization and hallucination; 2) Training on our dataset markedly
enhances LLMs capabilities in capturing nuanced rule patterns across similar
cases.

Abstract: In table question answering (TQA), tables are encoded as either texts or
images. Prior work suggests that passing images of tables to multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) performs comparably to or even better than using
textual input with large language models (LLMs). However, the lack of
controlled setups limits fine-grained distinctions between these approaches. In
this paper, we conduct the first controlled study on the effectiveness of
several combinations of table representations and models from two perspectives:
question complexity and table size. We build a new benchmark based on existing
TQA datasets. In a systematic analysis of seven pairs of MLLMs and LLMs, we
find that the best combination of table representation and model varies across
setups. We propose FRES, a method selecting table representations dynamically,
and observe a 10% average performance improvement compared to using both
representations indiscriminately.

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models promise universal image-text retrieval,
yet their social biases remain under-explored. We present the first systematic
audit of three public multilingual CLIP checkpoints -- M-CLIP, NLLB-CLIP, and
CAPIVARA-CLIP -- across ten languages that vary in resource availability and
grammatical gender. Using balanced subsets of \textsc{FairFace} and the
\textsc{PATA} stereotype suite in a zero-shot setting, we quantify race and
gender bias and measure stereotype amplification. Contrary to the assumption
that multilinguality mitigates bias, every model exhibits stronger gender bias
than its English-only baseline. CAPIVARA-CLIP shows its largest biases
precisely in the low-resource languages it targets, while the shared
cross-lingual encoder of NLLB-CLIP transports English gender stereotypes into
gender-neutral languages; loosely coupled encoders largely avoid this transfer.
Highly gendered languages consistently magnify all measured bias types, but
even gender-neutral languages remain vulnerable when cross-lingual weight
sharing imports foreign stereotypes. Aggregated metrics conceal
language-specific ``hot spots,'' underscoring the need for fine-grained,
language-aware bias evaluation in future multilingual vision-language research.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在无线通信领域复杂数学推理的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 开发了包含587个问题的WirelessMathBench，涵盖从基础到复杂的数学任务，并对多个领先LLMs进行测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a broad
array of tasks, yet their capacity for complex, domain-specific mathematical
reasoning-particularly in wireless communications-remains underexplored. In
this work, we introduce WirelessMathBench, a novel benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate LLMs on mathematical modeling challenges to wireless
communications engineering. Our benchmark consists of 587 meticulously curated
questions sourced from 40 state-of-the-art research papers, encompassing a
diverse spectrum of tasks ranging from basic multiple-choice questions to
complex equation completion tasks, including both partial and full completions,
all of which rigorously adhere to physical and dimensional constraints. Through
extensive experimentation with leading LLMs, we observe that while many models
excel in basic recall tasks, their performance degrades significantly when
reconstructing partially or fully obscured equations, exposing fundamental
limitations in current LLMs. Even DeepSeek-R1, the best performer on our
benchmark, achieves an average accuracy of only 38.05%, with a mere 7.83%
success rate in full equation completion. By publicly releasing
WirelessMathBench along with the evaluation toolkit, we aim to advance the
development of more robust, domain-aware LLMs for wireless system analysis and
broader engineering applications.

English-centric MT. Finally, we introduce SynOPUS, a public repository for
synthetic parallel datasets. Our findings show that LLM-generated synthetic

Conclusion: LRSA通过结合SLMs和LLMs的优势，显著提升了MABSA任务的性能，为预训练模型的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: There has been growing interest in Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
(MABSA) in recent years. Existing methods predominantly rely on pre-trained
small language models (SLMs) to collect information related to aspects and
sentiments from both image and text, with an aim to align these two modalities.
However, small SLMs possess limited capacity and knowledge, often resulting in
inaccurate identification of meaning, aspects, sentiments, and their
interconnections in textual and visual data. On the other hand, Large language
models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in various tasks by
effectively exploring fine-grained information in multimodal data. However,
some studies indicate that LLMs still fall short compared to fine-tuned small
models in the field of ABSA. Based on these findings, we propose a novel
framework, termed LRSA, which combines the decision-making capabilities of SLMs
with additional information provided by LLMs for MABSA. Specifically, we inject
explanations generated by LLMs as rationales into SLMs and employ a dual
cross-attention mechanism for enhancing feature interaction and fusion, thereby
augmenting the SLMs' ability to identify aspects and sentiments. We evaluated
our method using two baseline models, numerous experiments highlight the
superiority of our approach on three widely-used benchmarks, indicating its
generalizability and applicability to most pre-trained models for MABSA.

Conclusion: LFLMs具有高效学习能力，适合实际应用，尤其在数据有限场景下。

Abstract: We make the case for language models over logical forms (LFLMs), arguing that
such models are more data-efficient than their textual counterparts. To that
end, we introduce the Graph-based Formal-Logical Distributional Semantics
(GFoLDS) prototype, a pretrained LM over graph representations of logical
forms, as a proof-of-concept of LFLMs. Using GFoLDS, we present strong
experimental evidence that LFLMs can leverage the built-in, basic linguistic
knowledge inherent in such models to immediately begin learning more complex
patterns. On downstream tasks, we show that GFoLDS vastly outperforms textual,
transformer LMs pretrained on similar amounts of data, indicating that LFLMs
can learn with substantially less data than models over plain text.
Furthermore, we show that the performance of this model is likely to scale with
additional parameters and pretraining data, suggesting the viability of LFLMs
in real-world applications.

Result: 在多个MTEB基准测试中，MedEIR表现优于Jina V2和MiniLM，尤其在医学相关任务中。

Conclusion: MedEIR展示了在通用和领域特定任务中的高效性能，是现有嵌入模型的强有力替代。

Abstract: Embedding models have become essential for retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) tasks, semantic clustering, and text re-ranking. But despite their
growing use, many of these come with notable limitations. For example, Jina
fails to capture the semantic content of medical documents, while models such
as MiniLM often perform poorly on long-form documents. Domain-adapted models,
while specialized, often underperform in general-purpose tasks, reducing their
overall applicability. General-domain tokenizers often misinterpret medical
vocabulary. The limitations of current embedding models, whether in
tokenization accuracy, domain comprehension, or handling long sequences,
highlight the need for more versatile solutions. In this work, we present
MedEIR, a novel embedding model and tokenizer jointly optimized for both
medical and general NLP tasks, incorporating ALiBi-based long-context
processing to support sequences of up to 8,192 tokens. MedEIR was pre-trained
on only 6 billion tokens, significantly fewer than Jina's, followed by
fine-tuning on 3 million sentence pairs. MedEIR consistently outperforms Jina
V2 and MiniLM across MTEB benchmarks, achieving top scores on ArguAna (55.24),
NFCorpus (38.44), MedicalQARetrieval (74.25), SciFact (72.04), and TRECCOVID

Conclusion: Rank-K通过高效利用大型语言模型，显著提升了检索效果，并具备多语言能力。

Abstract: Retrieve-and-rerank is a popular retrieval pipeline because of its ability to
make slow but effective rerankers efficient enough at query time by reducing
the number of comparisons. Recent works in neural rerankers take advantage of
large language models for their capability in reasoning between queries and
passages and have achieved state-of-the-art retrieval effectiveness. However,
such rerankers are resource-intensive, even after heavy optimization. In this
work, we introduce Rank-K, a listwise passage reranking model that leverages
the reasoning capability of the reasoning language model at query time that
provides test time scalability to serve hard queries. We show that Rank-K
improves retrieval effectiveness by 23\% over the RankZephyr, the
state-of-the-art listwise reranker, when reranking a BM25 initial ranked list
and 19\% when reranking strong retrieval results by SPLADE-v3. Since Rank-K is
inherently a multilingual model, we found that it ranks passages based on
queries in different languages as effectively as it does in monolingual
retrieval.

Conclusion: 通过生成模型引入抽象总结，有效提升用户决策效率。

Abstract: Following the pandemic, customers, preference for using e-commerce has
accelerated. Since much information is available in multiple reviews (sometimes
running in thousands) for a single product, it can create decision paralysis
for the buyer. This scenario disempowers the consumer, who cannot be expected
to go over so many reviews since its time consuming and can confuse them.
Various commercial tools are available, that use a scoring mechanism to arrive
at an adjusted score. It can alert the user to potential review manipulations.
This paper proposes a framework that fine-tunes a generative pre-trained
transformer to understand these reviews better. Furthermore, using
"common-sense" to make better decisions. These models have more than 13 billion
parameters. To fine-tune the model for our requirement, we use the curie engine
from generative pre-trained transformer (GPT3). By using generative models, we
are introducing abstractive summarization. Instead of using a simple extractive
method of summarizing the reviews. This brings out the true relationship
between the reviews and not simply copy-paste. This introduces an element of
"common sense" for the user and helps them to quickly make the right decisions.
The user is provided the pros and cons of the processed reviews. Thus the
user/customer can take their own decisions.

image-caption alignment can implicitly align the text representations between

Conclusion: R1 Translator在EEG到文本解码任务中表现出色，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models like Gemini, GPT, and
others, bridging the gap between the human brain and language processing has
become an important area of focus. To address this challenge, researchers have
developed various models to decode EEG signals into text. However, these models
still face significant performance limitations. To overcome these shortcomings,
we propose a new model, R1 Translator, which aims to improve the performance of
EEG-to-text decoding. The R1 Translator model combines a bidirectional LSTM
encoder with a pretrained transformer-based decoder, utilizing EEG features to
produce high-quality text outputs. The model processes EEG embeddings through
the LSTM to capture sequential dependencies, which are then fed into the
transformer decoder for effective text generation. The R1 Translator excels in
ROUGE metrics, outperforming both T5 (previous research) and Brain Translator.
Specifically, R1 achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 38.00% (P), which is up to 9%
higher than T5 (34.89%) and 3% better than Brain (35.69%). It also leads in
ROUGE-L, with a F1 score of 32.51%, outperforming T5 by 3% (29.67%) and Brain
by 2% (30.38%). In terms of CER, R1 achieves a CER of 0.5795, which is 2% lower
than T5 (0.5917) and 4% lower than Brain (0.6001). Additionally, R1 performs
better in WER with a score of 0.7280, outperforming T5 by 4.3% (0.7610) and
Brain by 3.6% (0.7553). Code is available at

Conclusion: 记忆能力对解决复杂任务至关重要，MemoryEQA框架显著提升了EQA模型的性能。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to autonomously explore and
understand the environment to answer context-dependent questions. Existing
frameworks typically center around the planner, which guides the stopping
module, memory module, and answering module for reasoning. In this paper, we
propose a memory-centric EQA framework named MemoryEQA. Unlike planner-centric
EQA models where the memory module cannot fully interact with other modules,
MemoryEQA flexible feeds memory information into all modules, thereby enhancing
efficiency and accuracy in handling complex tasks, such as those involving
multiple targets across different regions. Specifically, we establish a
multi-modal hierarchical memory mechanism, which is divided into global memory
that stores language-enhanced scene maps, and local memory that retains
historical observations and state information. When performing EQA tasks, the
multi-modal large language model is leveraged to convert memory information
into the required input formats for injection into different modules. To
evaluate EQA models' memory capabilities, we constructed the MT-HM3D dataset
based on HM3D, comprising 1,587 question-answer pairs involving multiple
targets across various regions, which requires agents to maintain memory of
exploration-acquired target information. Experimental results on HM-EQA,
MT-HM3D, and OpenEQA demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, where a
19.8% performance gain on MT-HM3D compared to baseline model further
underscores memory capability's pivotal role in resolving complex tasks.

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is crucial for modern education, particularly
with the increasing prevalence of multimodal assessments. However, traditional
AES methods struggle with evaluation generalizability and multimodal
perception, while even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based
approaches can produce hallucinated justifications and scores misaligned with
human judgment. To address the limitations, we introduce CAFES, the first
collaborative multi-agent framework specifically designed for AES. It
orchestrates three specialized agents: an Initial Scorer for rapid,
trait-specific evaluations; a Feedback Pool Manager to aggregate detailed,
evidence-grounded strengths; and a Reflective Scorer that iteratively refines
scores based on this feedback to enhance human alignment. Extensive
experiments, using state-of-the-art MLLMs, achieve an average relative
improvement of 21% in Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) against ground truth,
especially for grammatical and lexical diversity. Our proposed CAFES framework
paves the way for an intelligent multimodal AES system. The code will be

Abstract: Multimodal models play a key role in empathy detection, but their performance
can suffer when modalities provide conflicting cues. To understand these
failures, we examine cases where unimodal and multimodal predictions diverge.
Using fine-tuned models for text, audio, and video, along with a gated fusion
model, we find that such disagreements often reflect underlying ambiguity, as
evidenced by annotator uncertainty. Our analysis shows that dominant signals in
one modality can mislead fusion when unsupported by others. We also observe
that humans, like models, do not consistently benefit from multimodal input.
These insights position disagreement as a useful diagnostic signal for
identifying challenging examples and improving empathy system robustness.

Method: 通过系统地变化目标词、层数及模型大小写形式，评估模型对868个标准复合词组合性的预测能力。

Result: 结果显示，德语BERT的表现明显落后于英语BERT，可能与德语复合词的高产性和歧义性有关。

Conclusion: 结论是德语复合词语义编码任务更具挑战性，需进一步研究。

Abstract: This paper investigates the extent to which pretrained German BERT encodes
knowledge of noun compound semantics. We comprehensively vary combinations of
target tokens, layers, and cased vs. uncased models, and evaluate them by
predicting the compositionality of 868 gold standard compounds. Looking at
representational patterns within the transformer architecture, we observe
trends comparable to equivalent prior work on English, with compositionality
information most easily recoverable in the early layers. However, our strongest
results clearly lag behind those reported for English, suggesting an inherently
more difficult task in German. This may be due to the higher productivity of
compounding in German than in English and the associated increase in
constituent-level ambiguity, including in our target compound set.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用学术论文的章节结构信息和文本提取关键词（KPE）的方法，通过结合结构特征和章节文本，提高了KPE的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术论文数量的激增增加了研究人员检索相关文献的时间，而现有的基于摘要的关键词提取方法受限于摘要长度，基于全文的方法则引入了噪声。本文旨在通过利用论文的章节结构信息解决这一问题。

Method: 1. 探索七种结构特征对KPE模型的影响；2. 通过关键词整合算法将各章节文本的提取结果整合为最终关键词。此外，还研究了章节结构分类质量对KPE性能的影响。

Result: 结合结构特征提升了KPE性能，不同特征对模型效果影响不同。关键词整合方法表现最佳，章节结构分类质量也会影响KPE性能。

Conclusion: 利用学术论文的章节结构信息有助于高效的关键词提取。

Abstract: The exponential increase in academic papers has significantly increased the
time required for researchers to access relevant literature. Keyphrase
Extraction (KPE) offers a solution to this situation by enabling researchers to
efficiently retrieve relevant literature. The current study on KPE from
academic articles aims to improve the performance of extraction models through
innovative approaches using Title and Abstract as input corpora. However, the
semantic richness of keywords is significantly constrained by the length of the
abstract. While full-text-based KPE can address this issue, it simultaneously
introduces noise, which significantly diminishes KPE performance. To address
this issue, this paper utilized the structural features and section texts
obtained from the section structure information of academic articles to extract
keyphrase from academic papers. The approach consists of two main parts: (1)
exploring the effect of seven structural features on KPE models, and (2)
integrating the extraction results from all section texts used as input corpora
for KPE models via a keyphrase integration algorithm to obtain the keyphrase
integration result. Furthermore, this paper also examined the effect of the
classification quality of section structure on the KPE performance. The results
show that incorporating structural features improves KPE performance, though
different features have varying effects on model efficacy. The keyphrase
integration approach yields the best performance, and the classification
quality of section structure can affect KPE performance. These findings
indicate that using the section structure information of academic articles
contributes to effective KPE from academic articles. The code and dataset
supporting this study are available at https://github.com/yan-xinyi/SSB_KPE.

Motivation: 传统细粒度情感分析方法需要特定架构和大量标注数据，限制了其泛化和扩展性。PL-FGSA旨在通过提示学习解决这些问题。

Method: PL-FGSA将细粒度情感分析重新定义为多任务提示增强生成问题，结合提示设计和TextCNN，在MindSpore平台上实现。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（SST-2、SemEval-2014 Task 4和MAMS）上，PL-FGSA表现优于传统微调方法，F1分数分别为0.922、0.694和0.597。

Conclusion: PL-FGSA通过提示学习提升了泛化能力和可解释性，适用于实际情感分析任务。

Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FGSA) aims to identify sentiment polarity
toward specific aspects within a text, enabling more precise opinion mining in
domains such as product reviews and social media. However, traditional FGSA
approaches often require task-specific architectures and extensive annotated
data, limiting their generalization and scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose PL-FGSA, a unified prompt learning-based framework
implemented using the MindSpore platform, which integrates prompt design with a
lightweight TextCNN backbone. Our method reformulates FGSA as a multi-task
prompt-augmented generation problem, jointly tackling aspect extraction,
sentiment classification, and causal explanation in a unified paradigm. By
leveraging prompt-based guidance, PL-FGSA enhances interpretability and
achieves strong performance under both full-data and low-resource conditions.
Experiments on three benchmark datasets-SST-2, SemEval-2014 Task 4, and
MAMS-demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms traditional
fine-tuning methods and achieves F1-scores of 0.922, 0.694, and 0.597,
respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of prompt-based
generalization and highlight the practical value of PL-FGSA for real-world
sentiment analysis tasks.

Abstract: Abstractive summarization of scientific papers has always been a research
focus, yet existing methods face two main challenges. First, most summarization
models rely on Encoder-Decoder architectures that treat papers as sequences of
words, thus fail to fully capture the structured information inherent in
scientific papers. Second, existing research often use keyword mapping or
feature engineering to identify the structural information, but these methods
struggle with the structural flexibility of scientific papers and lack
robustness across different disciplines. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stage abstractive summarization framework that leverages
automatic recognition of structural functions within scientific papers. In the
first stage, we standardize chapter titles from numerous scientific papers and
construct a large-scale dataset for structural function recognition. A
classifier is then trained to automatically identify the key structural
components (e.g., Background, Methods, Results, Discussion), which provides a
foundation for generating more balanced summaries. In the second stage, we
employ Longformer to capture rich contextual relationships across sections and
generating context-aware summaries. Experiments conducted on two
domain-specific scientific paper summarization datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms advanced baselines, and generates more comprehensive
summaries. The code and dataset can be accessed at

Conclusion: 深度思考方法能有效提升俚语翻译性能，SlangDIT任务和数据集为相关研究提供了基准。

Abstract: The challenge of slang translation lies in capturing context-dependent
semantic extensions, as slang terms often convey meanings beyond their literal
interpretation. While slang detection, explanation, and translation have been
studied as isolated tasks in the era of large language models (LLMs), their
intrinsic interdependence remains underexplored. The main reason is lacking of
a benchmark where the two tasks can be a prerequisite for the third one, which
can facilitate idiomatic translation. In this paper, we introduce the
interpretative slang translation task (named SlangDIT) consisting of three
sub-tasks: slang detection, cross-lingual slang explanation, and slang
translation within the current context, aiming to generate more accurate
translation with the help of slang detection and slang explanation. To this
end, we construct a SlangDIT dataset, containing over 25k English-Chinese
sentence pairs. Each source sentence mentions at least one slang term and is
labeled with corresponding cross-lingual slang explanation. Based on the
benchmark, we propose a deep thinking model, named SlangOWL. It firstly
identifies whether the sentence contains a slang, and then judges whether the
slang is polysemous and analyze its possible meaning. Further, the SlangOWL
provides the best explanation of the slang term targeting on the current
context. Finally, according to the whole thought, the SlangOWL offers a
suitable translation. Our experiments on LLMs (\emph{e.g.}, Qwen2.5 and
LLama-3.1), show that our deep thinking approach indeed enhances the
performance of LLMs where the proposed SLangOWL significantly surpasses the
vanilla models and supervised fine-tuned models without thinking.

Abstract: Considering the importance of detecting hateful language, labeled hate speech
data is expensive and time-consuming to collect, particularly for low-resource
languages. Prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-lingual
transfer learning and data augmentation in improving performance on tasks with
limited labeled data. To develop an efficient and scalable cross-lingual
transfer learning approach, we leverage nearest-neighbor retrieval to augment
minimal labeled data in the target language, thereby enhancing detection
performance. Specifically, we assume access to a small set of labeled training
instances in the target language and use these to retrieve the most relevant
labeled examples from a large multilingual hate speech detection pool. We
evaluate our approach on eight languages and demonstrate that it consistently
outperforms models trained solely on the target language data. Furthermore, in
most cases, our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art. Notably, our
approach is highly data-efficient, retrieving as small as 200 instances in some
cases while maintaining superior performance. Moreover, it is scalable, as the
retrieval pool can be easily expanded, and the method can be readily adapted to
new languages and tasks. We also apply maximum marginal relevance to mitigate
redundancy and filter out highly similar retrieved instances, resulting in
improvements in some languages.

Abstract: Hausa Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained increasing attention in
recent years, yet remains understudied as a low-resource language despite
having over 120 million first-language (L1) and 80 million second-language (L2)

Abstract: Predicting earnings surprises through the analysis of earnings conference
call transcripts has attracted increasing attention from the financial research
community. Conference calls serve as critical communication channels between
company executives, analysts, and shareholders, offering valuable
forward-looking information. However, these transcripts present significant
analytical challenges, typically containing over 5,000 words with substantial
redundancy and industry-specific terminology that creates obstacles for
language models. In this work, we propose the Sparse Autoencoder for Financial
Representation Enhancement (SAE-FiRE) framework to address these limitations by
extracting key information while eliminating redundancy. SAE-FiRE employs
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to efficiently identify patterns and filter out
noises, and focusing specifically on capturing nuanced financial signals that
have predictive power for earnings surprises. Experimental results indicate
that the proposed method can significantly outperform comparing baselines.

Abstract: Citation classification, which identifies the intention behind academic
citations, is pivotal for scholarly analysis. Previous works suggest
fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) on citation classification
datasets, reaping the reward of the linguistic knowledge they gained during
pretraining. However, directly fine-tuning for citation classification is
challenging due to labeled data scarcity, contextual noise, and spurious
keyphrase correlations. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Citss,
that adapts the PLMs to overcome these challenges. Citss introduces
self-supervised contrastive learning to alleviate data scarcity, and is
equipped with two specialized strategies to obtain the contrastive pairs:
sentence-level cropping, which enhances focus on target citations within long
contexts, and keyphrase perturbation, which mitigates reliance on specific
keyphrases. Compared with previous works that are only designed for
encoder-based PLMs, Citss is carefully developed to be compatible with both
encoder-based PLMs and decoder-based LLMs, to embrace the benefits of enlarged
pretraining. Experiments with three benchmark datasets with both encoder-based
PLMs and decoder-based LLMs demonstrate our superiority compared to the
previous state of the art. Our code is available at: github.com/LITONG99/Citss

Abstract: In the field of urban planning, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
frequently fail to effectively analyze and evaluate planning maps, despite the
critical importance of these visual elements for urban planners and related
educational contexts. Planning maps, which visualize land use, infrastructure

this challenge, we introduce PlanGPT-VL, the first domain-specific
Vision-Language Model tailored specifically for urban planning maps. PlanGPT-VL
employs three innovative approaches: (1) PlanAnno-V framework for high-quality
VQA data synthesis, (2) Critical Point Thinking to reduce hallucinations
through structured verification, and (3) comprehensive training methodology
combining Supervised Fine-Tuning with frozen vision encoder parameters. Through
systematic evaluation on our proposed PlanBench-V benchmark, we demonstrate
that PlanGPT-VL significantly outperforms general-purpose state-of-the-art VLMs
in specialized planning map interpretation tasks, offering urban planning
professionals a reliable tool for map analysis, assessment, and educational
applications while maintaining high factual accuracy. Our lightweight 7B

traits. In this work, we propose TRATES, a novel trait-specific and
rubric-based cross-prompt AES framework that is generic yet specific to the
underlying trait. The framework leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) that
utilizes the trait grading rubrics to generate trait-specific features
(represented by assessment questions), then assesses those features given an
essay. The trait-specific features are eventually combined with generic
writing-quality and prompt-specific features to train a simple classical
regression model that predicts trait scores of essays from an unseen prompt.
Experiments show that TRATES achieves a new state-of-the-art performance across
all traits on a widely-used dataset, with the generated LLM-based features
being the most significant.

Result: 在Memotion数据集上微F1分数提升13点，在FI数据集上宏F1分数提升8点。

Conclusion: EmoGist通过上下文依赖的情感标签解释显著提升了视觉情感分类的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EmoGist, a training-free, in-context learning
method for performing visual emotion classification with LVLMs. The key
intuition of our approach is that context-dependent definition of emotion
labels could allow more accurate predictions of emotions, as the ways in which
emotions manifest within images are highly context dependent and nuanced.
EmoGist pre-generates multiple explanations of emotion labels, by analyzing the
clusters of example images belonging to each category. At test time, we
retrieve a version of explanation based on embedding similarity, and feed it to
a fast VLM for classification. Through our experiments, we show that EmoGist
allows up to 13 points improvement in micro F1 scores with the multi-label
Memotion dataset, and up to 8 points in macro F1 in the multi-class FI dataset.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in neural spoken dialog systems,
personality-aware conversation agents -- capable of adapting behavior based on
personalities -- remain underexplored due to the absence of personality

audio recordings to create a dialogue dataset annotated with timestamps,
response types, and emotion/sentiment labels. We employ an automatic speech
recognition (ASR) system to extract transcripts and timestamps, then generate
conversation-level annotations. Leveraging these annotations, we design a
system that employs large language models to predict conversational
personality. Human evaluators were engaged to identify conversational
characteristics and assign personality labels. Our analysis demonstrates that
the proposed system achieves stronger alignment with human judgments compared

Conclusion: IDI在缺乏显式人口统计信息时能有效减少种族和年龄偏见，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: While subgroup disparities and performance bias are increasingly studied in
computational research, fairness in categorical Speech Emotion Recognition
(SER) remains underexplored. Existing methods often rely on explicit
demographic labels, which are difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns. To
address this limitation, we introduce an Implicit Demography Inference (IDI)
module that leverages pseudo-labeling from a pre-trained model and unsupervised
learning using k-means clustering to mitigate bias in SER. Our experiments show
that pseudo-labeling IDI reduces subgroup disparities, improving fairness
metrics by over 33% with less than a 3% decrease in SER accuracy. Also, the
unsupervised IDI yields more than a 26% improvement in fairness metrics with a
drop of less than 4% in SER performance. Further analyses reveal that the
unsupervised IDI consistently mitigates race and age disparities, demonstrating
its potential in scenarios where explicit demographic information is

Abstract: Orthographic transparency -- how directly spelling is related to sound --
lacks a unified, script-agnostic metric. Using ideas from algorithmic
information theory, we quantify orthographic transparency in terms of the
mutual compressibility between orthographic and phonological strings. Our
measure provides a principled way to combine two factors that decrease
orthographic transparency, capturing both irregular spellings and rule
complexity in one quantity. We estimate our transparency measure using
prequential code-lengths derived from neural sequence models. Evaluating 22
languages across a broad range of script types (alphabetic, abjad, abugida,
syllabic, logographic) confirms common intuitions about relative transparency
of scripts. Mutual compressibility offers a simple, principled, and general
yardstick for orthographic transparency.

Abstract: Current theories of language propose an innate (Baker 2001; Chomsky 1981) or
a functional (Greenberg 1963; Dryer 2007; Hawkins 2014) origin for the surface
structures (i.e. word order) that we observe in languages of the world, while
evolutionary modeling (Dunn et al. 2011) suggests that descent is the primary
factor influencing such patterns. Although there are hypotheses for word order
change from both innate and usage-based perspectives for specific languages and
families, there are key disagreements between the two major proposals for
mechanisms that drive the evolution of language more broadly (Wasow 2002; Levy
2008). This paper proposes a universal underlying mechanism for word order
change based on a large tagged parallel dataset of over 1,500 languages
representing 133 language families and 111 isolates. Results indicate that word
class length is significantly correlated with word order crosslinguistically,
but not in a straightforward manner, partially supporting opposing theories of
processing, while at the same time predicting historical word order change in
two different phylogenetic lines and explaining more variance than descent or
language area in regression models. Such findings suggest an integrated
"Min-Max" theory of language evolution driven by competing pressures of
processing and information structure, aligning with recent efficiency-oriented
(Levshina 2023) and information-theoretic proposals (Zaslavsky 2020; Tucker et
al. 2025).

Motivation: 自动化文献综述在言语病理学领域的应用需求，以提高效率和精确性。

Method: 从PubMed数据库中检索文献，应用LDA和BERTopic进行主题建模，并结合定制停用词表优化结果。

Result: LDA模型表现出强主题一致性和预测性能，BERTopic模型有效分类异构文献。

Conclusion: 该方法为言语病理学领域的自动化文献综述提供了基础。

Abstract: This technical report presents a natural language processing (NLP)-based
approach for systematically classifying scientific literature on childhood
speech disorders. We retrieved and filtered 4,804 relevant articles published
after 2015 from the PubMed database using domain-specific keywords. After
cleaning and pre-processing the abstracts, we applied two topic modeling
techniques - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic - to identify
latent thematic structures in the corpus. Our models uncovered 14 clinically
meaningful clusters, such as infantile hyperactivity and abnormal epileptic
behavior. To improve relevance and precision, we incorporated a custom stop
word list tailored to speech pathology. Evaluation results showed that the LDA
model achieved a coherence score of 0.42 and a perplexity of -7.5, indicating
strong topic coherence and predictive performance. The BERTopic model exhibited
a low proportion of outlier topics (less than 20%), demonstrating its capacity
to classify heterogeneous literature effectively. These results provide a
foundation for automating literature reviews in speech-language pathology.

Result: 实验表明新方法能更有效评估口音相似性，同时揭示了常用指标（如词错误率）的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究为口音相似性评估提供了更可靠的方法，并指出未来需改进对少数口音的评估。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in generating high-fidelity accents, evaluating
accent similarity in speech synthesis has been underexplored. We aim to enhance
both subjective and objective evaluation methods for accent similarity.
Subjectively, we refine the XAB listening test by adding components that
achieve higher statistical significance with fewer listeners and lower costs.
Our method involves providing listeners with transcriptions, having them
highlight perceived accent differences, and implementing meticulous screening
for reliability. Objectively, we utilise pronunciation-related metrics, based
on distances between vowel formants and phonetic posteriorgrams, to evaluate
accent generation. Comparative experiments reveal that these metrics, alongside
accent similarity, speaker similarity, and Mel Cepstral Distortion, can be
used. Moreover, our findings underscore significant limitations of common
metrics like Word Error Rate in assessing underrepresented accents.

Backtranslation (semi-supervised) - to translate Nepali into English. Using the
former, we are able to achieve a devtest Set SacreBLEU score of 14.2, which
improves the baseline fully supervised score reported by (Guzman et al., 2019)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于解码器模型的信息单向传播特性，视觉信息在语义表示中的吸收与注意力分布不一致，导致模型视觉理解能力下降和幻觉问题。

Method: 识别关注核心语义表示的注意力头，并通过两阶段优化范式将这些头的优势传播到整个模型，以对齐注意力分布与信息流。

Result: 在五个LVLM和三个图像描述基准测试中，该方法显著减少了幻觉现象，同时揭示了减少幻觉与丰富细节之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了模型的视觉理解能力，还允许手动调整模型的保守性，以满足多样化需求。

Abstract: Due to the unidirectional masking mechanism, Decoder-Only models propagate
information from left to right. LVLMs (Large Vision-Language Models) follow the
same architecture, with visual information gradually integrated into semantic
representations during forward propagation. Through systematic analysis, we
observe that over 80\% of the visual information is absorbed into the semantic
representations. However, the model's attention still predominantly focuses on
the visual representations. This misalignment between the attention
distribution and the actual information flow undermines the model's visual
understanding ability and contributes to hallucinations. To address this issue,
we enhance the model's visual understanding by leveraging the core information
embedded in semantic representations. Specifically, we identify attention heads
that focus on core semantic representations based on their attention
distributions. Then, through a two-stage optimization paradigm, we propagate
the advantages of these attention heads across the entire model, aligning the
attention distribution with the actual information flow. We evaluate our method
on three image captioning benchmarks using five different LVLMs, demonstrating
its effectiveness in significantly reducing hallucinations. Further experiments
reveal a trade-off between reduced hallucinations and richer details. Notably,
our method allows for manual adjustment of the model's conservativeness,
enabling flexible control to meet diverse real-world requirements. Code will be
released once accepted.

Motivation: 当前的多模态推测解码方法在 MLLMs 上无法达到与 LLMs 相同的加速效果，因此需要针对 MLLMs 重新设计推测解码方法。

Method: MSD 分离处理文本和视觉标记，采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段训练文本能力，第二阶段引入多模态数据增强视觉感知能力。

Result: MSD 在 LLaVA-1.5-7B 和 LLaVA-1.5-13B 上分别实现 2.29 倍和 2.46 倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: MSD 是一种高效的多模态推测解码方法，显著提升 MLLMs 的推理速度。

Abstract: This paper introduces Multimodal Speculative Decoding (MSD) to accelerate
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inference. Speculative decoding has
been shown to accelerate Large Language Models (LLMs) without sacrificing
accuracy. However, current speculative decoding methods for MLLMs fail to
achieve the same speedup as they do for LLMs. To address this, we reimagine
speculative decoding specifically for MLLMs. Our analysis of MLLM
characteristics reveals two key design principles for MSD: (1) Text and visual
tokens have fundamentally different characteristics and need to be processed
separately during drafting. (2) Both language modeling ability and visual
perception capability are crucial for the draft model. For the first principle,
MSD decouples text and visual tokens in the draft model, allowing each to be
handled based on its own characteristics. For the second principle, MSD uses a
two-stage training strategy: In stage one, the draft model is trained on
text-only instruction-tuning datasets to improve its language modeling ability.
In stage two, MSD gradually introduces multimodal data to enhance the visual
perception capability of the draft model. Experiments show that MSD boosts
inference speed by up to $2.29\times$ for LLaVA-1.5-7B and up to $2.46\times$
for LLaVA-1.5-13B on multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Result: MM-When2Speak在响应时机准确性上比现有单模态和LLM基线模型提升4倍。

Conclusion: 多模态输入对实现自然、及时的对话AI至关重要。

Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based chatbots have demonstrated strong
capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant responses, they
often struggle with understanding when to speak, particularly in delivering
brief, timely reactions during ongoing conversations. This limitation arises
largely from their reliance on text input, lacking the rich contextual cues in
real-world human dialogue. In this work, we focus on real-time prediction of
response types, with an emphasis on short, reactive utterances that depend on
subtle, multimodal signals across vision, audio, and text. To support this, we
introduce a new multimodal dataset constructed from real-world conversational
videos, containing temporally aligned visual, auditory, and textual streams.
This dataset enables fine-grained modeling of response timing in dyadic
interactions. Building on this dataset, we propose MM-When2Speak, a multimodal
LLM-based model that adaptively integrates visual, auditory, and textual
context to predict when a response should occur, and what type of response is
appropriate. Experiments show that MM-When2Speak significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art unimodal and LLM-based baselines, achieving up to a 4x
improvement in response timing accuracy over leading commercial LLMs. These
results underscore the importance of multimodal inputs for producing timely,
natural, and engaging conversational AI.

Conclusion: 通过强化学习和“描述-推理-回答”格式，可以有效提升视觉语言模型的推理能力，避免捷径学习。

Abstract: Learning general-purpose reasoning capabilities has long been a challenging
problem in AI. Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as
DeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can
enable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple
question-answer pairs. In this paper, we aim to train visual language models
(VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and
visual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
supervision. Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning
to a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before
providing an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy
questions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data
distributions. We argue that the key to mitigating shortcut learning is to
encourage the model to interpret images prior to reasoning. Therefore, we train
the model to adhere to a caption-reason-answer output format: initially
generating a detailed caption for an image, followed by constructing an
extensive reasoning chain. When trained on 273K CoT-free visual question-answer
pairs and using only reinforcement learning, our model, named Visionary-R1,
outperforms strong multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and
Gemini-1.5-Pro, on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: GRAT为扩散Transformer的加速提供了有效方案，有望推动可扩展视觉生成的研究。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Transformers have demonstrated impressive generative
capabilities, but their high computational costs hinder practical deployment,
for example, generating an $8192\times 8192$ image can take over an hour on an
A100 GPU. In this work, we propose GRAT (\textbf{GR}ouping first,
\textbf{AT}tending smartly), a training-free attention acceleration strategy
for fast image and video generation without compromising output quality. The
key insight is to exploit the inherent sparsity in learned attention maps
(which tend to be locally focused) in pretrained Diffusion Transformers and
leverage better GPU parallelism. Specifically, GRAT first partitions contiguous
tokens into non-overlapping groups, aligning both with GPU execution patterns
and the local attention structures learned in pretrained generative
Transformers. It then accelerates attention by having all query tokens within
the same group share a common set of attendable key and value tokens. These key
and value tokens are further restricted to structured regions, such as
surrounding blocks or criss-cross regions, significantly reducing computational
overhead (e.g., attaining a \textbf{35.8$\times$} speedup over full attention
when generating $8192\times 8192$ images) while preserving essential attention
patterns and long-range context. We validate GRAT on pretrained Flux and
HunyuanVideo for image and video generation, respectively. In both cases, GRAT
achieves substantially faster inference without any fine-tuning, while
maintaining the performance of full attention. We hope GRAT will inspire future
research on accelerating Diffusion Transformers for scalable visual generation.

Conclusion: FractalMamba++ 是一种高效且可扩展的视觉骨干网络。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently emerged as a promising alternative to
Transformer-based architectures, offering linear complexity in sequence length
while maintaining strong modeling capacity. However, its adaptation to visual
inputs is hindered by challenges in 2D-to-1D patch serialization and weak
scalability across input resolutions. Existing serialization strategies such as
raster scanning disrupt local spatial continuity and limit the model's ability
to generalize across scales. In this paper, we propose FractalMamba++, a robust
vision backbone that leverages fractal-based patch serialization via Hilbert
curves to preserve spatial locality and enable seamless resolution
adaptability. To address long-range dependency fading in high-resolution
inputs, we further introduce a Cross-State Routing (CSR) mechanism that
enhances global context propagation through selective state reuse.
Additionally, we propose a Positional-Relation Capture (PRC) module to recover
local adjacency disrupted by curve inflection points. Extensive experiments on
image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and change
detection demonstrate that FractalMamba++ consistently outperforms previous
Mamba-based backbones, particularly under high-resolution settings.

Conclusion: SGR为传统搜索策略与现代LLMs之间架起桥梁，提供了一种新颖有效的方法论。

Abstract: Session search involves a series of interactive queries and actions to
fulfill user's complex information need. Current strategies typically
prioritize sequential modeling for deep semantic understanding, overlooking the
graph structure in interactions. While some approaches focus on capturing
structural information, they use a generalized representation for documents,
neglecting the word-level semantic modeling. In this paper, we propose Symbolic
Graph Ranker (SGR), which aims to take advantage of both text-based and
graph-based approaches by leveraging the power of recent Large Language Models
(LLMs). Concretely, we first introduce a set of symbolic grammar rules to
convert session graph into text. This allows integrating session history,
interaction process, and task instruction seamlessly as inputs for the LLM.
Moreover, given the natural discrepancy between LLMs pre-trained on textual
corpora, and the symbolic language we produce using our graph-to-text grammar,
our objective is to enhance LLMs' ability to capture graph structures within a
textual format. To achieve this, we introduce a set of self-supervised symbolic
learning tasks including link prediction, node content generation, and
generative contrastive learning, to enable LLMs to capture the topological
information from coarse-grained to fine-grained. Experiment results and
comprehensive analysis on two benchmark datasets, AOL and Tiangong-ST, confirm
the superiority of our approach. Our paradigm also offers a novel and effective
methodology that bridges the gap between traditional search strategies and
modern LLMs.

Conclusion: UniVG-R1在通用视觉定位任务中表现出色，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Traditional visual grounding methods primarily focus on single-image
scenarios with simple textual references. However, extending these methods to
real-world scenarios that involve implicit and complex instructions,
particularly in conjunction with multiple images, poses significant challenges,
which is mainly due to the lack of advanced reasoning ability across diverse
multi-modal contexts. In this work, we aim to address the more practical
universal grounding task, and propose UniVG-R1, a reasoning guided multimodal
large language model (MLLM) for universal visual grounding, which enhances
reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
cold-start data. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) grounding dataset, annotated with detailed reasoning
chains, to guide the model towards correct reasoning paths via supervised
fine-tuning. Subsequently, we perform rule-based reinforcement learning to
encourage the model to identify correct reasoning chains, thereby incentivizing
its reasoning capabilities. In addition, we identify a difficulty bias arising
from the prevalence of easy samples as RL training progresses, and we propose a
difficulty-aware weight adjustment strategy to further strengthen the
performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of UniVG-R1,
which achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIG-Bench with a 9.1%
improvement over the previous method. Furthermore, our model exhibits strong
generalizability, achieving an average improvement of 23.4% in zero-shot
performance across four image and video reasoning grounding benchmarks. The

Conclusion: Visual-ARFT为构建鲁棒且通用的多模态代理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: A key trend in Large Reasoning Models (e.g., OpenAI's o3) is the native
agentic ability to use external tools such as web browsers for searching and
writing/executing code for image manipulation to think with images. In the
open-source research community, while significant progress has been made in
language-only agentic abilities such as function calling and tool integration,
the development of multi-modal agentic capabilities that involve truly thinking
with images, and their corresponding benchmarks, are still less explored. This
work highlights the effectiveness of Visual Agentic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(Visual-ARFT) for enabling flexible and adaptive reasoning abilities for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). With Visual-ARFT, open-source LVLMs gain the
ability to browse websites for real-time information updates and write code to
manipulate and analyze input images through cropping, rotation, and other image
processing techniques. We also present a Multi-modal Agentic Tool Bench (MAT)
with two settings (MAT-Search and MAT-Coding) designed to evaluate LVLMs'
agentic search and coding abilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that
Visual-ARFT outperforms its baseline by +18.6% F1 / +13.0% EM on MAT-Coding and
+10.3% F1 / +8.7% EM on MAT-Search, ultimately surpassing GPT-4o. Visual-ARFT
also achieves +29.3 F1% / +25.9% EM gains on existing multi-hop QA benchmarks
such as 2Wiki and HotpotQA, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.
Our findings suggest that Visual-ARFT offers a promising path toward building

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用多模态LLM生成放射学报告时，忽略了LLM内部已嵌入的知识，导致信息冗余和效率低下。

Method: RADAR首先提取LLM内部与专家图像分类输出一致的知识，再检索外部补充知识，最后整合两者生成报告。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR、CheXpert-Plus和IU X-ray数据集上，RADAR在语言质量和临床准确性上优于现有LLM。

Conclusion: RADAR通过系统整合内部和外部知识，显著提升了放射学报告生成的效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various domains, including radiology report generation. Previous approaches
have attempted to utilize multimodal LLMs for this task, enhancing their
performance through the integration of domain-specific knowledge retrieval.
However, these approaches often overlook the knowledge already embedded within
the LLMs, leading to redundant information integration and inefficient
utilization of learned representations. To address this limitation, we propose
RADAR, a framework for enhancing radiology report generation with supplementary
knowledge injection. RADAR improves report generation by systematically
leveraging both the internal knowledge of an LLM and externally retrieved
information. Specifically, it first extracts the model's acquired knowledge
that aligns with expert image-based classification outputs. It then retrieves
relevant supplementary knowledge to further enrich this information. Finally,
by aggregating both sources, RADAR generates more accurate and informative
radiology reports. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert-Plus, and IU
X-ray demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs in both
language quality and clinical accuracy

Motivation: 现有世界模型需要大量领域特定训练且预测质量低，而视频扩散模型能生成高质量视频，但缺乏交互性。Vid2World旨在结合两者优势。

Method: 通过因果化预训练视频扩散模型的架构和训练目标，并引入因果动作引导机制，实现自回归生成和动作可控性。

Result: 在机器人操作和游戏仿真领域，Vid2World展示了将视频扩散模型转化为交互式世界模型的可扩展性和有效性。

Conclusion: Vid2World为利用视频扩散模型构建高质量交互式世界模型提供了通用方法。

Abstract: World models, which predict transitions based on history observation and
action sequences, have shown great promise in improving data efficiency for
sequential decision making. However, existing world models often require
extensive domain-specific training and still produce low-fidelity, coarse
predictions, limiting their applicability in complex environments. In contrast,
video diffusion models trained on large, internet-scale datasets have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality videos that
capture diverse real-world dynamics. In this work, we present Vid2World, a
general approach for leveraging and transferring pre-trained video diffusion
models into interactive world models. To bridge the gap, Vid2World performs
casualization of a pre-trained video diffusion model by crafting its
architecture and training objective to enable autoregressive generation.
Furthermore, it introduces a causal action guidance mechanism to enhance action
controllability in the resulting interactive world model. Extensive experiments
in robot manipulation and game simulation domains show that our method offers a
scalable and effective approach for repurposing highly capable video diffusion
models to interactive world models.

Result: 实验表明，使用DDA对齐的MSCOCO训练的检测器在8个基准测试中性能显著提升，尤其在野外基准上提高了7.2%。

Conclusion: DDA方法有效解决了数据偏差问题，提升了检测器的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing detectors are often trained on biased datasets, leading to the
possibility of overfitting on non-causal image attributes that are spuriously
correlated with real/synthetic labels. While these biased features enhance
performance on the training data, they result in substantial performance
degradation when applied to unbiased datasets. One common solution is to
perform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the
semantic content between real and synthetic images. However, we revisit this
approach and show that pixel-level alignment alone is insufficient. The
reconstructed images still suffer from frequency-level misalignment, which can
perpetuate spurious correlations. To illustrate, we observe that reconstruction
models tend to restore the high-frequency details lost in real images (possibly
due to JPEG compression), inadvertently creating a frequency-level
misalignment, where synthetic images appear to have richer high-frequency
content than real ones. This misalignment leads to models associating
high-frequency features with synthetic labels, further reinforcing biased cues.
To resolve this, we propose Dual Data Alignment (DDA), which aligns both the
pixel and frequency domains. Moreover, we introduce two new test sets:
DDA-COCO, containing DDA-aligned synthetic images for testing detector
performance on the most aligned dataset, and EvalGEN, featuring the latest
generative models for assessing detectors under new generative architectures
such as visual auto-regressive generators. Finally, our extensive evaluations
demonstrate that a detector trained exclusively on DDA-aligned MSCOCO could
improve across 8 diverse benchmarks by a non-trivial margin, showing a +7.2% on
in-the-wild benchmarks, highlighting the improved generalizability of unbiased
detectors.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet they are primarily constrained by
text-based reasoning processes. However, achieving seamless integration of
visual and textual reasoning which mirrors human cognitive processes remains a
significant challenge. In particular, effectively incorporating advanced visual
input processing into reasoning mechanisms is still an open question. Thus, in
this paper, we explore the interleaved multimodal reasoning paradigm and
introduce DeepEyes, a model with "thinking with images" capabilities
incentivized through end-to-end reinforcement learning without the need for
cold-start SFT. Notably, this ability emerges natively within the model itself,
leveraging its inherent grounding ability as a tool instead of depending on
separate specialized models. Specifically, we propose a tool-use-oriented data
selection mechanism and a reward strategy to encourage successful tool-assisted
reasoning trajectories. DeepEyes achieves significant performance gains on
fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks and also demonstrates
improvement in grounding, hallucination, and mathematical reasoning tasks.
Interestingly, we observe the distinct evolution of tool-calling behavior from
initial exploration to efficient and accurate exploitation, and diverse
thinking patterns that closely mirror human visual reasoning processes. Code is

Abstract: Video large language models (VideoLLM) excel at video understanding, but face
efficiency challenges due to the quadratic complexity of abundant visual
tokens. Our systematic analysis of token compression methods for VideoLLMs
reveals two critical issues: (i) overlooking distinctive visual signals across
frames, leading to information loss; (ii) suffering from implementation
constraints, causing incompatibility with modern architectures or efficient
operators. To address these challenges, we distill three design principles for
VideoLLM token compression and propose a plug-and-play inference acceleration
framework "Video Compression Commander" (VidCom2). By quantifying each frame's
uniqueness, VidCom2 adaptively adjusts compression intensity across frames,
effectively preserving essential information while reducing redundancy in video
sequences. Extensive experiments across various VideoLLMs and benchmarks
demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our VidCom2. With only
25% visual tokens, VidCom2 achieves 99.6% of the original performance on
LLaVA-OV while reducing 70.8% of the LLM generation latency. Notably, our Frame

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
long video understanding (LVU), prompting the development of standardized LVU
benchmarks to evaluate their performance. However, our investigation reveals a
rather sober lesson for existing LVU benchmarks. First, most existing
benchmarks rely heavily on multiple-choice questions (MCQs), whose evaluation
results are inflated due to the possibility of guessing the correct answer;
Second, a significant portion of questions in these benchmarks have strong
priors to allow models to answer directly without even reading the input video.
For example, Gemini-1.5-Pro can achieve over 50\% accuracy given a random frame
from a long video on Video-MME. We also observe that increasing the number of
frames does not necessarily lead to improvement on existing benchmarks, which
is counterintuitive. As a result, the validity and robustness of current LVU
benchmarks are undermined, impeding a faithful assessment of LMMs' long-video
understanding capability. To tackle this problem, we propose VideoEval-Pro, a
realistic LVU benchmark containing questions with open-ended short-answer,
which truly require understanding the entire video. VideoEval-Pro assesses both
segment-level and full-video understanding through perception and reasoning
tasks. By evaluating 21 proprietary and open-source video LMMs, we conclude the
following findings: (1) video LMMs show drastic performance ($>$25\%) drops on
open-ended questions compared with MCQs; (2) surprisingly, higher MCQ scores do
not lead to higher open-ended scores on VideoEval-Pro; (3) compared to other
MCQ benchmarks, VideoEval-Pro benefits more from increasing the number of input
frames. Our results show that VideoEval-Pro offers a more realistic and
reliable measure of long video understanding, providing a clearer view of
progress in this domain.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in incentivizing
reasoning and generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
through reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, the potential of
reasoning-induced computational modeling has not been thoroughly explored in
the context of image quality assessment (IQA), a task critically dependent on
visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisualQuality-R1, a
reasoning-induced no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) model, and we train it with
reinforcement learning to rank, a learning algorithm tailored to the
intrinsically relative nature of visual quality. Specifically, for a pair of
images, we employ group relative policy optimization to generate multiple
quality scores for each image. These estimates are then used to compute
comparative probabilities of one image having higher quality than the other
under the Thurstone model. Rewards for each quality estimate are defined using
continuous fidelity measures rather than discretized binary labels. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed VisualQuality-R1 consistently outperforms
discriminative deep learning-based NR-IQA models as well as a recent
reasoning-induced quality regression method. Moreover, VisualQuality-R1 is
capable of generating contextually rich, human-aligned quality descriptions,
and supports multi-dataset training without requiring perceptual scale
realignment. These features make VisualQuality-R1 especially well-suited for
reliably measuring progress in a wide range of image processing tasks like

Abstract: Cross-modal embeddings form the foundation for multi-modal models. However,
visualization methods for interpreting cross-modal embeddings have been
primarily confined to traditional dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques like
PCA and t-SNE. These DR methods primarily focus on feature distributions within
a single modality, whilst failing to incorporate metrics (e.g., CLIPScore)
across multiple modalities.This paper introduces AKRMap, a new DR technique
designed to visualize cross-modal embeddings metric with enhanced accuracy by
learning kernel regression of the metric landscape in the projection space.
Specifically, AKRMap constructs a supervised projection network guided by a
post-projection kernel regression loss, and employs adaptive generalized
kernels that can be jointly optimized with the projection. This approach
enables AKRMap to efficiently generate visualizations that capture complex
metric distributions, while also supporting interactive features such as zoom
and overlay for deeper exploration. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that
AKRMap outperforms existing DR methods in generating more accurate and
trustworthy visualizations. We further showcase the effectiveness of AKRMap in
visualizing and comparing cross-modal embeddings for text-to-image models. Code

Conclusion: 通过结合Mamba的效率和局部注意力增强模块，实现了对小目标的高效检测，同时多模态融合进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Target detection in high-resolution remote sensing imagery faces challenges
due to the low recognition accuracy of small targets and high computational
costs. The computational complexity of the Transformer architecture increases
quadratically with image resolution, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
architectures are forced to stack deeper convolutional layers to expand their
receptive fields, leading to an explosive growth in computational demands. To
address these computational constraints, we leverage Mamba's linear complexity
for efficiency. However, Mamba's performance declines for small targets,
primarily because small targets occupy a limited area in the image and have
limited semantic information. Accurate identification of these small targets
necessitates not only Mamba's global attention capabilities but also the
precise capture of fine local details. To this end, we enhance Mamba by
developing the Enhanced Small Target Detection (ESTD) module and the
Convolutional Attention Residual Gate (CARG) module. The ESTD module bolsters
local attention to capture fine-grained details, while the CARG module, built
upon Mamba, emphasizes spatial and channel-wise information, collectively
improving the model's ability to capture distinctive representations of small
targets. Additionally, to highlight the semantic representation of small
targets, we design a Mask Enhanced Pixel-level Fusion (MEPF) module for
multispectral fusion, which enhances target features by effectively fusing
visible and infrared multimodal information.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a valuable technique for compressing large
deep learning models into smaller, edge-suitable networks. However,
conventional KD frameworks rely on pre-trained high-capacity teacher networks,
which introduce significant challenges such as increased memory/storage
requirements, additional training costs, and ambiguity in selecting an
appropriate teacher for a given student model. Although a teacher-free
distillation (self-distillation) has emerged as a promising alternative, many
existing approaches still rely on architectural modifications or complex
training procedures, which limit their generality and efficiency.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on
teacher-free distillation that operates using a single student network without
any auxiliary components, architectural modifications, or additional learnable
parameters. Our approach is built on a simple yet highly effective
augmentation, called intra-class patch swap augmentation. This augmentation
simulates a teacher-student dynamic within a single model by generating pairs
of intra-class samples with varying confidence levels, and then applying
instance-to-instance distillation to align their predictive distributions. Our
method is conceptually simple, model-agnostic, and easy to implement, requiring
only a single augmentation function. Extensive experiments across image
classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection show that our
method consistently outperforms both existing self-distillation baselines and
conventional teacher-based KD approaches. These results suggest that the
success of self-distillation could hinge on the design of the augmentation
itself. Our codes are available at

Abstract: Existing video understanding benchmarks often conflate knowledge-based and
purely image-based questions, rather than clearly isolating a model's temporal
reasoning ability, which is the key aspect that distinguishes video
understanding from other modalities. We identify two major limitations that
obscure whether higher scores truly indicate stronger understanding of the
dynamic content in videos: (1) strong language priors, where models can answer
questions without watching the video; and (2) shuffling invariance, where
models maintain similar performance on certain questions even when video frames
are temporally shuffled. To alleviate these issues, we propose VBenchComp, an
automated pipeline that categorizes questions into different domains:
LLM-Answerable, Semantic, and Temporal. Specifically, LLM-Answerable questions
can be answered without viewing the video; Semantic questions remain answerable
even when the video frames are shuffled; and Temporal questions require
understanding the correct temporal order of frames. The rest of the questions
are labeled as Others. This can enable fine-grained evaluation of different
capabilities of a video LLM. Our analysis reveals nuanced model weaknesses that
are hidden by traditional overall scores, and we offer insights and
recommendations for designing future benchmarks that more accurately assess
video LLMs.

TL;DR: VI-CoT（视觉交错思维链）通过逐步更新的中间视觉状态（IVS）提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的任务表现，但现有基准测试限制了IVS的自由性。为此，作者提出ViC-Bench基准测试，包含四项任务，并设计了三阶段评估策略和新指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试固定IVS，可能扭曲模型的原始思维轨迹，无法评估其内在推理能力，且未系统研究IVS对推理性能的影响。

Method: 提出ViC-Bench基准测试，包含迷宫导航、拼图、长程规划和复杂计数四项任务，支持自由式IVS生成。设计三阶段评估策略和新指标，并采用IPII策略探索提示因素。

Result: 对18种先进MLLMs进行评估，揭示了其VI-CoT能力的关键见解。

Conclusion: ViC-Bench为系统评估MLLMs的VI-CoT能力提供了新工具，并揭示了IVS对推理性能的影响。

Abstract: Visual-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (VI-CoT) enables MLLMs to continually
update their understanding and decisions based on step-wise intermediate visual
states (IVS), much like a human would, which demonstrates impressive success in
various tasks, thereby leading to emerged advancements in related benchmarks.
Despite promising progress, current benchmarks provide models with relatively
fixed IVS, rather than free-style IVS, whch might forcibly distort the original
thinking trajectories, failing to evaluate their intrinsic reasoning
capabilities. More importantly, existing benchmarks neglect to systematically
explore the impact factors that IVS would impart to untamed reasoning
performance. To tackle above gaps, we introduce a specialized benchmark termed
ViC-Bench, consisting of four representive tasks: maze navigation, jigsaw
puzzle, embodied long-horizon planning, and complex counting, where each task
has dedicated free-style IVS generation pipeline supporting function calls. To
systematically examine VI-CoT capability, we propose a thorough evaluation
suite incorporating a progressive three-stage strategy with targeted new
metrics. Besides, we establish Incremental Prompting Information Injection
(IPII) strategy to ablatively explore the prompting factors for VI-CoT. We
extensively conduct evaluations for 18 advanced MLLMs, revealing key insights
into their VI-CoT capability. Our proposed benchmark is publicly open at
Huggingface.

Result: 评估16种主流LMMs，发现其对先验知识和文本上下文的过度依赖；PanoDPO显著提升了时间分析的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PanoDPO能有效增强LMMs在时间分析中的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
performance on general video comprehension benchmarks. Nevertheless, for
broader applications, the robustness of their temporal analysis capability
needs to be thoroughly investigated yet predominantly ignored. Motivated by
this, we propose a novel temporal robustness benchmark (TemRobBench), which
introduces temporal inconsistency perturbations separately at the visual and
textual modalities to assess the robustness of models. We evaluate 16
mainstream LMMs and find that they exhibit over-reliance on prior knowledge and
textual context in adversarial environments, while ignoring the actual temporal
dynamics in the video. To mitigate this issue, we design panoramic direct
preference optimization (PanoDPO), which encourages LMMs to incorporate both
visual and linguistic feature preferences simultaneously. Experimental results
show that PanoDPO can effectively enhance the model's robustness and
reliability in temporal analysis.

Conclusion: 检索增强方法和文化包容性基准对多模态理解具有重要价值。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily
life, the need for accurate visual culture understanding is becoming critical.
Yet, these models frequently fall short in interpreting cultural nuances
effectively. Prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in enhancing cultural understanding in
text-only settings, while its application in multimodal scenarios remains
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAVENEA (Retrieval-Augmented
Visual culturE uNdErstAnding), a new benchmark designed to advance visual
culture understanding through retrieval, focusing on two tasks: culture-focused
visual question answering (cVQA) and culture-informed image captioning (cIC).
RAVENEA extends existing datasets by integrating over 10,000 Wikipedia
documents curated and ranked by human annotators. With RAVENEA, we train and
evaluate seven multimodal retrievers for each image query, and measure the
downstream impact of retrieval-augmented inputs across fourteen
state-of-the-art VLMs. Our results show that lightweight VLMs, when augmented
with culture-aware retrieval, outperform their non-augmented counterparts (by
at least 3.2% absolute on cVQA and 6.2% absolute on cIC). This highlights the
value of retrieval-augmented methods and culturally inclusive benchmarks for
multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range
of applications, from natural language processing and computer vision to speech
recognition. However, as tasks become increasingly complex, model sizes
continue to grow, posing challenges in latency and memory efficiency. To meet
these constraints, post-training quantization has emerged as a promising
solution. In this paper, we propose a novel hardware-efficient quantization and
inference scheme that exploits hardware advantages with minimal accuracy
degradation. Specifically, we introduce a W4A8 scheme, where weights are
quantized and stored using 4-bit integer precision, and inference computations
are performed using 8-bit floating-point arithmetic, demonstrating significant
speedups and improved memory utilization compared to 16-bit operations,
applicable on various modern accelerators. To mitigate accuracy loss, we
develop a novel quantization algorithm, dubbed Dual Precision Quantization
(DPQ), that leverages the unique structure of our scheme without introducing
additional inference overhead. Experimental results demonstrate improved
performance (i.e., increased throughput) while maintaining tolerable accuracy
degradation relative to the full-precision model.

Conclusion: 增强理解有助于生成，生成过程也能为理解提供反馈。

Abstract: Personalized models have demonstrated remarkable success in understanding and
generating concepts provided by users. However, existing methods use separate
concept tokens for understanding and generation, treating these tasks in
isolation. This may result in limitations for generating images with complex
prompts. For example, given the concept $\langle bo\rangle$, generating
"$\langle bo\rangle$ wearing its hat" without additional textual descriptions
of its hat. We call this kind of generation personalized knowledge-driven
generation. To address the limitation, we present UniCTokens, a novel framework
that effectively integrates personalized information into a unified vision
language model (VLM) for understanding and generation. UniCTokens trains a set
of unified concept tokens to leverage complementary semantics, boosting two
personalized tasks. Moreover, we propose a progressive training strategy with
three stages: understanding warm-up, bootstrapping generation from
understanding, and deepening understanding from generation to enhance mutual
benefits between both tasks. To quantitatively evaluate the unified VLM
personalization, we present UnifyBench, the first benchmark for assessing
concept understanding, concept generation, and knowledge-driven generation.
Experimental results on UnifyBench indicate that UniCTokens shows competitive
performance compared to leading methods in concept understanding, concept

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs), with their 360{\deg} field of view, provide
unparalleled spatial awareness for immersive applications like augmented
reality and embodied AI. However, the capability of existing multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) to comprehend and reason about such panoramic scenes
remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing OmniVQA,
the first dataset and conducting the first benchmark for omnidirectional visual
question answering. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals
significant limitations in handling omnidirectional visual question answering,
highlighting persistent challenges in object localization, feature extraction,
and hallucination suppression within panoramic contexts. These results
underscore the disconnect between current MLLM capabilities and the demands of
omnidirectional visual understanding, which calls for dedicated architectural
or training innovations tailored to 360{\deg} imagery. Building on the OmniVQA
dataset and benchmark, we further introduce a rule-based reinforcement learning
method, 360-R1, based on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct. Concretely, we modify the group
relative policy optimization (GRPO) by proposing three novel reward functions:
(1) reasoning process similarity reward, (2) answer semantic accuracy reward,
and (3) structured format compliance reward. Extensive experiments on our
OmniVQA demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in omnidirectional
space (+6% improvement).

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了潜在空间的实用性和可解释性，超越了现有基于解缠的方法。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models for learning
latent representations. Standard VAEs generate dispersed and unstructured
latent spaces by utilizing all dimensions, which limits their interpretability,
especially in high-dimensional spaces. To address this challenge, Variational
Sparse Coding (VSC) introduces a spike-and-slab prior distribution, resulting
in sparse latent representations for each input. These sparse representations,
characterized by a limited number of active dimensions, are inherently more
interpretable. Despite this advantage, VSC falls short in providing structured
interpretations across samples within the same class. Intuitively, samples from
the same class are expected to share similar attributes while allowing for
variations in those attributes. This expectation should manifest as consistent
patterns of active dimensions in their latent representations, but VSC does not
enforce such consistency.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the latent space
interpretability by ensuring that the active dimensions in the latent space are
consistent across samples within the same class. To achieve this, we introduce
a new loss function that encourages samples from the same class to share
similar active dimensions. This alignment creates a more structured and
interpretable latent space, where each shared dimension corresponds to a
high-level concept, or "factor." Unlike existing disentanglement-based methods
that primarily focus on global factors shared across all classes, our method
captures both global and class-specific factors, thereby enhancing the utility
and interpretability of latent representations.

Abstract: Supervised learning demands large amounts of precisely annotated data to
achieve promising results. Such data curation is labor-intensive and imposes
significant overhead regarding time and costs. Self-supervised learning (SSL)
partially overcomes these limitations by exploiting vast amounts of unlabeled
data and creating surrogate (pretext or proxy) tasks to learn useful
representations without manual labeling. As a result, SSL has become a powerful
machine learning (ML) paradigm for solving several practical downstream
computer vision problems, such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
Image segmentation is the cornerstone of many high-level visual perception
applications, including medical imaging, intelligent transportation,
agriculture, and surveillance. Although there is substantial research potential
for developing advanced algorithms for SSL-based semantic segmentation, a
comprehensive study of existing methodologies is essential to trace advances
and guide emerging researchers. This survey thoroughly investigates over 150
recent image segmentation articles, particularly focusing on SSL. It provides a
practical categorization of pretext tasks, downstream tasks, and commonly used
benchmark datasets for image segmentation research. It concludes with key
observations distilled from a large body of literature and offers future
directions to make this research field more accessible and comprehensible for

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localisation identifies coarse geographical position of an
automated vehicle by matching a ground-level image to a geo-tagged satellite
image from a database. Despite the advancements in Cross-view geo-localisation,
significant challenges still persist such as similar looking scenes which makes
it challenging to find the correct match as the top match. Existing approaches
reach high recall rates but they still fail to rank the correct image as the
top match. To address this challenge, this paper proposes GeoVLM, a novel
approach which uses the zero-shot capabilities of vision language models to
enable cross-view geo-localisation using interpretable cross-view language
descriptions. GeoVLM is a trainable reranking approach which improves the best
match accuracy of cross-view geo-localisation. GeoVLM is evaluated on standard
benchmark VIGOR and University-1652 and also through real-life driving
environments using Cross-View United Kingdom, a new benchmark dataset

Conclusion: fBP为神经形态硬件的反向传播学习设计提供了有效指导。

Abstract: Direct training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware
can greatly reduce energy costs compared to GPU-based training. However,
implementing Backpropagation (BP) on such hardware is challenging because
forward and backward passes are typically performed by separate networks with
distinct weights. To compute correct gradients, forward and feedback weights
must remain symmetric during training, necessitating weight transport between
the two networks. This symmetry requirement imposes hardware overhead and
increases energy costs. To address this issue, we introduce Frozen
Backpropagation (fBP), a BP-based training algorithm relaxing weight symmetry
in settings with separate networks. fBP updates forward weights by computing
gradients with periodically frozen feedback weights, reducing weight transports
during training and minimizing synchronization overhead. To further improve
transport efficiency, we propose three partial weight transport schemes of
varying computational complexity, where only a subset of weights is transported
at a time. We evaluate our methods on image recognition tasks and compare them
to existing approaches addressing the weight symmetry requirement. Our results
show that fBP outperforms these methods and achieves accuracy comparable to BP.
With partial weight transport, fBP can substantially lower transport costs by
1,000x with an accuracy drop of only 0.5pp on CIFAR-10 and 1.1pp on CIFAR-100,
or by up to 10,000x at the expense of moderated accuracy loss. This work
provides insights for guiding the design of neuromorphic hardware incorporating
BP-based on-chip learning.

mouthing recognition in German Sign Language. We leverage three VSR datasets:
one in English, one in German with unrelated words and one in German containing
the same target words as the mouthing dataset, to investigate the impact of
task similarity in this setting. Our results demonstrate that multi-task

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
multi-modal tasks by effectively aligning visual and textual representations.
However, most video understanding VLM research has been domain-agnostic,
leaving the understanding of their transfer learning capability to specialized
domains under-explored. In this work, we address this by exploring the
adaptability of open-source VLMs to specific domains, and focusing on soccer as
an initial case study. Our approach uses large-scale soccer datasets and LLM to
create instruction-following data, and use them to iteratively fine-tune the
general-domain VLM in a curriculum learning fashion (first teaching the model

Motivation: 现有视频-文本检索基准存在视频时长短、标注质量低和粒度粗的问题，限制了高级方法的评估。

Method: 提出LoVR基准，包含长视频和细粒度剪辑；设计高效标注框架（VLM生成、质量评分、动态优化）和语义融合方法生成连贯的全视频标注。

Result: LoVR基准对现有嵌入模型提出了挑战，揭示了当前方法的局限性。

Conclusion: LoVR为视频理解和检索研究提供了新的挑战和见解。

Abstract: Long videos contain a vast amount of information, making video-text retrieval
an essential and challenging task in multimodal learning. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse
annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text
retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark
specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long
videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To
overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an
efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic
generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline
improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we
introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions
without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces
longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting
new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on
various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging
benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing
valuable insights for future research. We release the code and dataset link at

Motivation: 视频类增量学习（VCIL）因时空结构的复杂性而面临灾难性遗忘和动态建模的挑战，现有方法依赖示例重放或忽视时间建模。

Method: 1. 提出帧共享语义蒸馏（FSSD），选择性地保留关键语义通道；2. 设计基于时间分解的混合专家（TD-MoE），动态路由任务特定专家。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Kinetics400上表现优于现有基线，同时提高了可解释性和效率。

Conclusion: StPR通过解耦时空信息，实现了无示例的统一VCIL框架，解决了灾难性遗忘和动态建模问题。

Abstract: Video Class-Incremental Learning (VCIL) seeks to develop models that
continuously learn new action categories over time without forgetting
previously acquired knowledge. Unlike traditional Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL), VCIL introduces the added complexity of spatiotemporal structures,
making it particularly challenging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while
effectively capturing both frame-shared semantics and temporal dynamics.
Existing approaches either rely on exemplar rehearsal, raising concerns over
memory and privacy, or adapt static image-based methods that neglect temporal
modeling. To address these limitations, we propose Spatiotemporal Preservation
and Routing (StPR), a unified and exemplar-free VCIL framework that explicitly
disentangles and preserves spatiotemporal information. First, we introduce
Frame-Shared Semantics Distillation (FSSD), which identifies semantically
stable and meaningful channels by jointly considering semantic sensitivity and
classification contribution. These important semantic channels are selectively
regularized to maintain prior knowledge while allowing for adaptation. Second,
we design a Temporal Decomposition-based Mixture-of-Experts (TD-MoE), which
dynamically routes task-specific experts based on their temporal dynamics,
enabling inference without task ID or stored exemplars. Together, StPR
effectively leverages spatial semantics and temporal dynamics, achieving a
unified, exemplar-free VCIL framework. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51,
and Kinetics400 show that our method outperforms existing baselines while
offering improved interpretability and efficiency in VCIL. Code is available in

Conclusion: EGFormer在高效性和通用性上表现突出，适用于多模态任务。

Abstract: Recent efforts have explored multimodal semantic segmentation using various
backbone architectures. However, while most methods aim to improve accuracy,
their computational efficiency remains underexplored. To address this, we
propose EGFormer, an efficient multimodal semantic segmentation framework that
flexibly integrates an arbitrary number of modalities while significantly
reducing model parameters and inference time without sacrificing performance.
Our framework introduces two novel modules. First, the Any-modal Scoring Module
(ASM) assigns importance scores to each modality independently, enabling
dynamic ranking based on their feature maps. Second, the Modal Dropping Module
(MDM) filters out less informative modalities at each stage, selectively
preserving and aggregating only the most valuable features. This design allows
the model to leverage useful information from all available modalities while
discarding redundancy, thus ensuring high segmentation quality. In addition to
efficiency, we evaluate EGFormer on a synthetic-to-real transfer task to
demonstrate its generalizability. Extensive experiments show that EGFormer
achieves competitive performance with up to 88 percent reduction in parameters
and 50 percent fewer GFLOPs. Under unsupervised domain adaptation settings, it
further achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance compared to existing
methods.

Abstract: The pursuit of decision safety in clinical applications highlights the
potential of concept-based methods in medical imaging. While these models offer
active interpretability, they often suffer from concept leakages, where
unintended information within soft concept representations undermines both
interpretability and generalizability. Moreover, most concept-based models
focus solely on local explanations (instance-level), neglecting the global
decision logic (dataset-level). To address these limitations, we propose
Concept Rule Learner (CRL), a novel framework to learn Boolean logical rules
from binarized visual concepts. CRL employs logical layers to capture concept
correlations and extract clinically meaningful rules, thereby providing both
local and global interpretability. Experiments on two medical image
classification tasks show that CRL achieves competitive performance with
existing methods while significantly improving generalizability to

following an analyze-then-parse paradigm. In the first stage, Dolphin generates
a sequence of layout elements in reading order. These heterogeneous elements,
serving as anchors and coupled with task-specific prompts, are fed back to
Dolphin for parallel content parsing in the second stage. To train Dolphin, we
construct a large-scale dataset of over 30 million samples, covering
multi-granularity parsing tasks. Through comprehensive evaluations on both
prevalent benchmarks and self-constructed ones, Dolphin achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse page-level and element-level
settings, while ensuring superior efficiency through its lightweight

Result: 在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$上的实验表明，1-shot mIoU比最佳基线提高了4.2%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了FSS中的匹配和分割问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) aims to learn class-agnostic segmentation on few
classes to segment arbitrary classes, but at the risk of overfitting. To
address this, some methods use the well-learned knowledge of foundation models
(e.g., SAM) to simplify the learning process. Recently, SAM 2 has extended SAM
by supporting video segmentation, whose class-agnostic matching ability is
useful to FSS. A simple idea is to encode support foreground (FG) features as
memory, with which query FG features are matched and fused. Unfortunately, the
FG objects in different frames of SAM 2's video data are always the same
identity, while those in FSS are different identities, i.e., the matching step
is incompatible. Therefore, we design Pseudo Prompt Generator to encode pseudo
query memory, matching with query features in a compatible way. However, the
memories can never be as accurate as the real ones, i.e., they are likely to
contain incomplete query FG, and some unexpected query background (BG)
features, leading to wrong segmentation. Hence, we further design Iterative
Memory Refinement to fuse more query FG features into the memory, and devise a
Support-Calibrated Memory Attention to suppress the unexpected query BG
features in memory. Extensive experiments have been conducted on PASCAL-5$^i$
and COCO-20$^i$ to validate the effectiveness of our design, e.g., the 1-shot
mIoU can be 4.2\% better than the best baseline.

Abstract: Supervised pretrained models have become widely used in deep learning,
especially for image segmentation tasks. However, when applied to specialized
datasets such as biomedical imaging, pretrained weights often introduce
unintended biases. These biases cause models to assign different levels of
importance to different slices, leading to inconsistencies in feature
utilization, which can be observed as asymmetries in saliency map
distributions. This transfer of color distributions from natural images to
non-natural datasets can compromise model performance and reduce the
reliability of results. In this study, we investigate the effects of these
biases and propose strategies to mitigate them. Through a series of
experiments, we test both pretrained and randomly initialized models, comparing
their performance and saliency map distributions. Our proposed methods, which
aim to neutralize the bias introduced by pretrained color channel weights,
demonstrate promising results, offering a practical approach to improving model
explainability while maintaining the benefits of pretrained models. This
publication presents our findings, providing insights into addressing
pretrained weight biases across various deep learning tasks.

Result: 在多个医学影像和COCO数据集上验证，CONSIGN显著优于标准像素级CP方法。

Conclusion: 考虑空间结构能显著提升不确定性估计的质量和性能。

Abstract: Most machine learning-based image segmentation models produce pixel-wise
confidence scores - typically derived from softmax outputs - that represent the
model's predicted probability for each class label at every pixel. While this
information can be particularly valuable in high-stakes domains such as medical
imaging, these (uncalibrated) scores are heuristic in nature and do not
constitute rigorous quantitative uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction
(CP) provides a principled framework for transforming heuristic confidence
scores into statistically valid uncertainty estimates. However, applying CP
directly to image segmentation ignores the spatial correlations between pixels,
a fundamental characteristic of image data. This can result in overly
conservative and less interpretable uncertainty estimates. To address this, we
propose CONSIGN (Conformal Segmentation Informed by Spatial Groupings via
Decomposition), a CP-based method that incorporates spatial correlations to
improve uncertainty quantification in image segmentation. Our method generates
meaningful prediction sets that come with user-specified, high-probability
error guarantees. It is compatible with any pre-trained segmentation model
capable of generating multiple sample outputs - such as those using dropout,
Bayesian modeling, or ensembles. We evaluate CONSIGN against a standard
pixel-wise CP approach across three medical imaging datasets and two COCO
dataset subsets, using three different pre-trained segmentation models. Results
demonstrate that accounting for spatial structure significantly improves
performance across multiple metrics and enhances the quality of uncertainty
estimates.

Conclusion: LMP框架有效解决了视频生成中的细粒度控制问题，提升了生成视频的质量和可控性。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained diffusion transformer models have
made significant progress in video generation. While current DiT models can
produce high-definition, high-frame-rate, and highly diverse videos, there is a
lack of fine-grained control over the video content. Controlling the motion of
subjects in videos using only prompts is challenging, especially when it comes
to describing complex movements. Further, existing methods fail to control the
motion in image-to-video generation, as the subject in the reference image
often differs from the subject in the reference video in terms of initial
position, size, and shape. To address this, we propose the Leveraging Motion
Prior (LMP) framework for zero-shot video generation. Our framework harnesses
the powerful generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion transformers to
enable motion in the generated videos to reference user-provided motion videos
in both text-to-video and image-to-video generation. To this end, we first
introduce a foreground-background disentangle module to distinguish between
moving subjects and backgrounds in the reference video, preventing interference
in the target video generation. A reweighted motion transfer module is designed
to allow the target video to reference the motion from the reference video. To
avoid interference from the subject in the reference video, we propose an
appearance separation module to suppress the appearance of the reference
subject in the target video. We annotate the DAVIS dataset with detailed
prompts for our experiments and design evaluation metrics to validate the
effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in generation quality,
prompt-video consistency, and control capability. Our homepage is available at

Motivation: Challenges the conventional use of human-perceptual data for fine-tuning by showing that early integration yields better generalization.

Method: Initializes a CLIP vision encoder with human-derived triplet embeddings from NIGHTS, followed by self-supervised learning on YFCC15M.

Result: Significant zero-shot performance improvements across 29 classification and 2 retrieval benchmarks, with gains on ImageNet-1K after 15 epochs.

Conclusion: Early integration of human perception provides a stronger foundation for general-purpose vision-language intelligence.

Abstract: We introduce Perceptual-Initialization (PI), a paradigm shift in visual
representation learning that incorporates human perceptual structure during the
initialization phase rather than as a downstream fine-tuning step. By
integrating human-derived triplet embeddings from the NIGHTS dataset to
initialize a CLIP vision encoder, followed by self-supervised learning on
YFCC15M, our approach demonstrates significant zero-shot performance
improvements, without any task-specific fine-tuning, across 29 zero shot
classification and 2 retrieval benchmarks. On ImageNet-1K, zero-shot gains
emerge after approximately 15 epochs of pretraining. Benefits are observed
across datasets of various scales, with improvements manifesting at different
stages of the pretraining process depending on dataset characteristics. Our
approach consistently enhances zero-shot top-1 accuracy, top-5 accuracy, and
retrieval recall (e.g., R@1, R@5) across these diverse evaluation tasks,
without requiring any adaptation to target domains. These findings challenge
the conventional wisdom of using human-perceptual data primarily for
fine-tuning and demonstrate that embedding human perceptual structure during
early representation learning yields more capable and vision-language aligned
systems that generalize immediately to unseen tasks. Our work shows that
"beginning with you", starting with human perception, provides a stronger
foundation for general-purpose vision-language intelligence.

Conclusion: 解耦分类器头是解决FSOD和FSIS中偏置分类问题的有效方法。

Abstract: This paper focus on few-shot object detection~(FSOD) and instance
segmentation~(FSIS), which requires a model to quickly adapt to novel classes
with a few labeled instances. The existing methods severely suffer from bias
classification because of the missing label issue which naturally exists in an
instance-level few-shot scenario and is first formally proposed by us. Our
analysis suggests that the standard classification head of most FSOD or FSIS
models needs to be decoupled to mitigate the bias classification. Therefore, we
propose an embarrassingly simple but effective method that decouples the
standard classifier into two heads. Then, these two individual heads are
capable of independently addressing clear positive samples and noisy negative
samples which are caused by the missing label. In this way, the model can

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for
high-quality image generation and editing. Many existing approaches rely on
text prompts as editing guidance. However, these methods are constrained by the
need for manual prompt crafting, which can be time-consuming, introduce
irrelevant details, and significantly limit editing performance. In this work,
we propose optimizing semantic embeddings guided by attribute classifiers to
steer text-to-image models toward desired edits, without relying on text
prompts or requiring any training or fine-tuning of the diffusion model. We
utilize classifiers to learn precise semantic embeddings at the dataset level.
The learned embeddings are theoretically justified as the optimal
representation of attribute semantics, enabling disentangled and accurate
edits. Experiments further demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of
disentanglement and strong generalization across different domains of data.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) has been prevalent in recent years, with most common
condition tasks having been optimized nicely. Besides, counterfactual
Text-to-Image is obstructing us from a more versatile AIGC experience. For
those scenes that are impossible to happen in real world and anti-physics, we
should spare no efforts in increasing the factual feel, which means
synthesizing images that people think very likely to be happening, and concept
alignment, which means all the required objects should be in the same frame. In
this paper, we focus on concept alignment. As controllable T2I models have
achieved satisfactory performance for real applications, we utilize this
technology to replace the objects in a synthesized image in latent space
step-by-step to change the image from a common scene to a counterfactual scene
to meet the prompt. We propose a strategy to instruct this replacing process,
which is called as Explicit Logical Narrative Prompt (ELNP), by using the newly
SoTA language model DeepSeek to generate the instructions. Furthermore, to
evaluate models' performance in counterfactual T2I, we design a metric to
calculate how many required concepts in the prompt can be covered averagely in
the synthesized images. The extensive experiments and qualitative comparisons
demonstrate that our strategy can boost the concept alignment in counterfactual
T2I.

Abstract: Vision-language modeling (VLM) aims to bridge the information gap between
images and natural language. Under the new paradigm of first pre-training on
massive image-text pairs and then fine-tuning on task-specific data, VLM in the
remote sensing domain has made significant progress. The resulting models
benefit from the absorption of extensive general knowledge and demonstrate
strong performance across a variety of remote sensing data analysis tasks.
Moreover, they are capable of interacting with users in a conversational
manner. In this paper, we aim to provide the remote sensing community with a
timely and comprehensive review of the developments in VLM using the two-stage
paradigm. Specifically, we first cover a taxonomy of VLM in remote sensing:
contrastive learning, visual instruction tuning, and text-conditioned image
generation. For each category, we detail the commonly used network architecture
and pre-training objectives. Second, we conduct a thorough review of existing
works, examining foundation models and task-specific adaptation methods in
contrastive-based VLM, architectural upgrades, training strategies and model

Motivation: 立体匹配在遮挡和非朗伯表面等不适定区域表现不佳，而现有的单目先验因数据偏差限制了泛化能力。本文旨在利用VFM的无偏单目先验改进这一问题。

Method: 提出二进制局部排序图统一相对和绝对深度表示，并通过像素级线性回归模块自适应对齐单目深度与视差。

Result: 在从SceneFlow到Middlebury和Booster数据集的泛化实验中，性能显著提升且效率几乎不受影响。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且高效地利用单目先验改进了立体匹配结果。

Abstract: The matching formulation makes it naturally hard for the stereo matching to
handle ill-posed regions like occlusions and non-Lambertian surfaces. Fusing
monocular priors has been proven helpful for ill-posed matching, but the biased
monocular prior learned from small stereo datasets constrains the
generalization. Recently, stereo matching has progressed by leveraging the
unbiased monocular prior from the vision foundation model (VFM) to improve the
generalization in ill-posed regions. We dive into the fusion process and
observe three main problems limiting the fusion of the VFM monocular prior. The
first problem is the misalignment between affine-invariant relative monocular
depth and absolute depth of disparity. Besides, when we use the monocular
feature in an iterative update structure, the over-confidence in the disparity
update leads to local optima results. A direct fusion of a monocular depth map
could alleviate the local optima problem, but noisy disparity results computed
at the first several iterations will misguide the fusion. In this paper, we
propose a binary local ordering map to guide the fusion, which converts the
depth map into a binary relative format, unifying the relative and absolute
depth representation. The computed local ordering map is also used to re-weight
the initial disparity update, resolving the local optima and noisy problem. In
addition, we formulate the final direct fusion of monocular depth to the
disparity as a registration problem, where a pixel-wise linear regression
module can globally and adaptively align them. Our method fully exploits the
monocular prior to support stereo matching results effectively and efficiently.
We significantly improve the performance from the experiments when generalizing
from SceneFlow to Middlebury and Booster datasets while barely reducing the
efficiency.

Conclusion: ReservoirTTA在持续非平稳测试分布中表现稳健，优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces ReservoirTTA, a novel plug-in framework designed for
prolonged test-time adaptation (TTA) in scenarios where the test domain
continuously shifts over time, including cases where domains recur or evolve
gradually. At its core, ReservoirTTA maintains a reservoir of
domain-specialized models -- an adaptive test-time model ensemble -- that both
detects new domains via online clustering over style features of incoming
samples and routes each sample to the appropriate specialized model, and
thereby enables domain-specific adaptation. This multi-model strategy overcomes
key limitations of single model adaptation, such as catastrophic forgetting,
inter-domain interference, and error accumulation, ensuring robust and stable
performance on sustained non-stationary test distributions. Our theoretical
analysis reveals key components that bound parameter variance and prevent model
collapse, while our plug-in TTA module mitigates catastrophic forgetting of
previously encountered domains. Extensive experiments on the classification
corruption benchmarks, including ImageNet-C and CIFAR-10/100-C, as well as the
Cityscapes$\rightarrow$ACDC semantic segmentation task, covering recurring and
continuously evolving domain shifts, demonstrate that ReservoirTTA
significantly improves adaptation accuracy and maintains stable performance
across prolonged, recurring shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Invisible image watermarking can protect image ownership and prevent
malicious misuse of visual generative models. However, existing generative
watermarking methods are mainly designed for diffusion models while
watermarking for autoregressive image generation models remains largely
underexplored. We propose IndexMark, a training-free watermarking framework for
autoregressive image generation models. IndexMark is inspired by the redundancy
property of the codebook: replacing autoregressively generated indices with
similar indices produces negligible visual differences. The core component in
IndexMark is a simple yet effective match-then-replace method, which carefully
selects watermark tokens from the codebook based on token similarity, and
promotes the use of watermark tokens through token replacement, thereby
embedding the watermark without affecting the image quality. Watermark
verification is achieved by calculating the proportion of watermark tokens in
generated images, with precision further improved by an Index Encoder.
Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary validation scheme to enhance robustness
against cropping attacks. Experiments demonstrate that IndexMark achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of image quality and verification
accuracy, and exhibits robustness against various perturbations, including
cropping, noises, Gaussian blur, random erasing, color jittering, and JPEG
compression.

Abstract: In the realm of information retrieval, users often engage in multi-turn
interactions with search engines to acquire information, leading to the
formation of sequences of user feedback behaviors. Leveraging the session
context has proven to be beneficial for inferring user search intent and
document ranking. A multitude of approaches have been proposed to exploit
in-session context for improved document ranking. Despite these advances, the
limitation of historical session data for capturing evolving user intent
remains a challenge. In this work, we explore the integration of future
contextual information into the session context to enhance document ranking. We
present the siamese model optimization framework, comprising a
history-conditioned model and a future-aware model. The former processes only
the historical behavior sequence, while the latter integrates both historical
and anticipated future behaviors. Both models are trained collaboratively using
the supervised labels and pseudo labels predicted by the other. The
history-conditioned model, referred to as ForeRanker, progressively learns
future-relevant information to enhance ranking, while it singly uses historical
session at inference time. To mitigate inconsistencies during training, we
introduce the peer knowledge distillation method with a dynamic gating
mechanism, allowing models to selectively incorporate contextual information.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
ForeRanker, showcasing its superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Worldwide image geolocalization-the task of predicting GPS coordinates from
images taken anywhere on Earth-poses a fundamental challenge due to the vast
diversity in visual content across regions. While recent approaches adopt a
two-stage pipeline of retrieving candidates and selecting the best match, they

failing to model spatial relationships among candidates. In this paper, we
propose GeoRanker, a distance-aware ranking framework that leverages large
vision-language models to jointly encode query-candidate interactions and
predict geographic proximity. In addition, we introduce a multi-order distance
loss that ranks both absolute and relative distances, enabling the model to
reason over structured spatial relationships. To support this, we curate
GeoRanking, the first dataset explicitly designed for geographic ranking tasks

of spatial features using time series modeling have shown high performance.
However, there remains a paucity of research on training methods for CNNs

recognition. In this study, we propose a method for representation learning in

Abstract: Existing point cloud representation learning tend to learning the geometric
distribution of objects through data-driven approaches, emphasizing structural
features while overlooking the relationship between the local information and
the whole structure. Local features reflect the fine-grained variations of an
object, while the whole structure is determined by the interaction and
combination of these local features, collectively defining the object's shape.
In real-world, objects undergo elastic deformation under external forces, and
this deformation gradually affects the whole structure through the propagation
of forces from local regions, thereby altering the object's geometric
properties. Inspired by this, we propose a physics-driven self-supervised
learning method for point cloud representation, which captures the relationship
between parts and the whole by constructing a local-whole force propagation
mechanism. Specifically, we employ a dual-task encoder-decoder framework,
integrating the geometric modeling capability of implicit fields with
physics-driven elastic deformation. The encoder extracts features from the
point cloud and its tetrahedral mesh representation, capturing both geometric
and physical properties. These features are then fed into two decoders: one
learns the whole geometric shape of the point cloud through an implicit field,
while the other predicts local deformations using two specifically designed
physics information loss functions, modeling the deformation relationship
between local and whole shapes. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing approaches in object classification, few-shot learning,
and segmentation, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Occupancy Grid Maps are widely used in navigation for their ability to
represent 3D space occupancy. However, existing methods that utilize multi-view
cameras to construct Occupancy Networks for perception modeling suffer from
cubic growth in data complexity. Adopting a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) perspective
offers a more practical solution for autonomous driving, as it provides higher
semantic density and mitigates complex object occlusions. Nonetheless,
BEV-based approaches still require extensive engineering optimizations to
enable efficient large-scale global modeling. To address this challenge, we
propose InstanceBEV, the first method to introduce instance-level
dimensionality reduction for BEV, enabling global modeling with transformers
without relying on sparsification or acceleration operators. Different from
other BEV methods, our approach directly employs transformers to aggregate
global features. Compared to 3D object detection models, our method samples
global feature maps into 3D space. Experiments on OpenOcc-NuScenes dataset show
that InstanceBEV achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a

TL;DR: MGStream 使用运动相关的3D高斯（3DGs）和静态3DGs分别重建动态和静态场景，解决了3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在动态新视角合成中的闪烁问题和存储效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在动态场景重建中存在闪烁、存储效率低和难以建模新物体的问题。

Method: MGStream采用运动掩码和聚类凸包算法实现运动相关3DGs，对动态部分应用刚性变形，并通过注意力优化建模新物体。

Result: 在N3DV和MeetRoom数据集上，MGStream在渲染质量、训练/存储效率和时序一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MGStream通过优化动态部分的3DGs，显著提升了动态场景重建的性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention in streamable
dynamic novel view synthesis (DNVS) for its photorealistic rendering capability
and computational efficiency. Despite much progress in improving rendering
quality and optimization strategies, 3DGS-based streamable dynamic scene
reconstruction still suffers from flickering artifacts and storage
inefficiency, and struggles to model the emerging objects. To tackle this, we
introduce MGStream which employs the motion-related 3D Gaussians (3DGs) to
reconstruct the dynamic and the vanilla 3DGs for the static. The motion-related
3DGs are implemented according to the motion mask and the clustering-based
convex hull algorithm. The rigid deformation is applied to the motion-related
3DGs for modeling the dynamic, and the attention-based optimization on the
motion-related 3DGs enables the reconstruction of the emerging objects. As the
deformation and optimization are only conducted on the motion-related 3DGs,
MGStream avoids flickering artifacts and improves the storage efficiency.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets N3DV and MeetRoom demonstrate that
MGStream surpasses existing streaming 3DGS-based approaches in terms of
rendering quality, training/storage efficiency and temporal consistency. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/pcl3dv/MGStream.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声视频通常信噪比低且分辨率有限，设备和采集设置的差异进一步降低了预训练模型的泛化能力。

Method: 采用视频自适应优化过程的神经网络，无需配对数据即可增强分辨率并降噪。

Result: 定量和视觉评估显示DUP优于现有超分辨率算法，显著提升下游应用效果。

Conclusion: DUP为超声视频提供了一种有效的自监督超分辨率解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely applied in clinical practice, yet ultrasound
videos often suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited
resolutions, posing challenges for diagnosis and analysis. Variations in
equipment and acquisition settings can further exacerbate differences in data
distribution and noise levels, reducing the generalizability of pre-trained
models. This work presents a self-supervised ultrasound video super-resolution
algorithm called Deep Ultrasound Prior (DUP). DUP employs a video-adaptive
optimization process of a neural network that enhances the resolution of given
ultrasound videos without requiring paired training data while simultaneously
removing noise. Quantitative and visual evaluations demonstrate that DUP
outperforms existing super-resolution algorithms, leading to substantial
improvements for downstream applications.

Method: 采用像素级多元高斯表示，均值向量编码同一像素的多个深度值，协方差矩阵决定是否需要多标签表示，并在GRU框架中迭代预测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了透明表面的深度估计性能，同时保留了背景信息。

Conclusion: 多标签回归方法在透明场景深度估计中表现优越。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a multi-label stereo matching method to
simultaneously estimate the depth of the transparent objects and the occluded
background in transparent scenes.Unlike previous methods that assume a unimodal
distribution along the disparity dimension and formulate the matching as a
single-label regression problem, we propose a multi-label regression
formulation to estimate multiple depth values at the same pixel in transparent
scenes. To resolve the multi-label regression problem, we introduce a
pixel-wise multivariate Gaussian representation, where the mean vector encodes
multiple depth values at the same pixel, and the covariance matrix determines
whether a multi-label representation is necessary for a given pixel. The
representation is iteratively predicted within a GRU framework. In each
iteration, we first predict the update step for the mean parameters and then
use both the update step and the updated mean parameters to estimate the
covariance matrix. We also synthesize a dataset containing 10 scenes and 89
objects to validate the performance of transparent scene depth estimation. The
experiments show that our method greatly improves the performance on
transparent surfaces while preserving the background information for scene
reconstruction. Code is available at https://github.com/BFZD233/TranScene.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision for precision agriculture, yet

diverse, realistic datasets and the difficulty of annotating dense,
heterogeneous scenes. Existing datasets overlook different growth stages and
stereo imagery, both essential for realistic 3D modeling of orchards and tasks

a farm in Brandenburg (Germany), covering six agriculturally validated growth
stages over a full growth cycle. The second subset consists of 1,125 densely

MinneApple with our data improves YOLOv8 performance by 7.69 % in terms of

Conclusion: Land-MoE通过参数高效的方式微调VFMs，显著提升了多光谱土地覆盖分类的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce Land-MoE, a novel approach for multispectral land cover
classification (MLCC). Spectral shift, which emerges from disparities in
sensors and geospatial conditions, poses a significant challenge in this
domain. Existing methods predominantly rely on domain adaptation and
generalization strategies, often utilizing small-scale models that exhibit
limited performance. In contrast, Land-MoE addresses these issues by
hierarchically inserting a Frequency-aware Mixture of Low-rank Token Experts,
to fine-tune Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in a parameter-efficient manner.
Specifically, Land-MoE comprises two key modules: the mixture of low-rank token
experts (MoLTE) and frequency-aware filters (FAF). MoLTE leverages
rank-differentiated tokens to generate diverse feature adjustments for
individual instances within multispectral images. By dynamically combining
learnable low-rank token experts of varying ranks, it enhances the robustness
against spectral shifts. Meanwhile, FAF conducts frequency-domain modulation on
the refined features. This process enables the model to effectively capture
frequency band information that is strongly correlated with semantic essence,
while simultaneously suppressing frequency noise irrelevant to the task.
Comprehensive experiments on MLCC tasks involving cross-sensor and
cross-geospatial setups demonstrate that Land-MoE outperforms existing methods
by a large margin. Additionally, the proposed approach has also achieved
state-of-the-art performance in domain generalization semantic segmentation
tasks of RGB remote sensing images.

Conclusion: ReactDiff在多模态反应生成中表现优异，代码开源。

Abstract: Given the audio-visual clip of the speaker, facial reaction generation aims
to predict the listener's facial reactions. The challenge lies in capturing the
relevance between video and audio while balancing appropriateness, realism, and
diversity. While prior works have mostly focused on uni-modal inputs or
simplified reaction mappings, recent approaches such as PerFRDiff have explored
multi-modal inputs and the one-to-many nature of appropriate reaction mappings.
In this work, we propose the Facial Reaction Diffusion (ReactDiff) framework
that uniquely integrates a Multi-Modality Transformer with conditional
diffusion in the latent space for enhanced reaction generation. Unlike existing
methods, ReactDiff leverages intra- and inter-class attention for fine-grained
multi-modal interaction, while the latent diffusion process between the encoder
and decoder enables diverse yet contextually appropriate outputs. Experimental
results demonstrate that ReactDiff significantly outperforms existing
approaches, achieving a facial reaction correlation of 0.26 and diversity score
of 0.094 while maintaining competitive realism. The code is open-sourced at

Motivation: 直接使用固定权重的Chamfer距离（CD）作为目标函数可能导致全局分布性能不佳，尽管整体性能看似良好。

Method: 提出FCD，通过动态调整CD的两个组件的权重，优先优化全局分布。

Result: 实验表明，FCD在CD、EMD、DCD和F-Score等多个指标上表现优异，且人类评估结果更好。

Conclusion: FCD能够有效平衡点云生成的全局分布和局部性能，提升生成质量。

Abstract: Chamfer Distance (CD) comprises two components that can evaluate the global
distribution and local performance of generated point clouds, making it widely
utilized as a similarity measure between generated and target point clouds in
point cloud completion tasks. Additionally, CD's computational efficiency has
led to its frequent application as an objective function for guiding point
cloud generation. However, using CD directly as an objective function with
fixed equal weights for its two components can often result in seemingly high
overall performance (i.e., low CD score), while failing to achieve a good
global distribution. This is typically reflected in high Earth Mover's Distance
(EMD) and Decomposed Chamfer Distance (DCD) scores, alongside poor human
assessments. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible-Weighted Chamfer
Distance (FCD) to guide point cloud generation. FCD assigns a higher weight to
the global distribution component of CD and incorporates a flexible weighting
strategy to adjust the balance between the two components, aiming to improve
global distribution while maintaining robust overall performance. Experimental
results on two state-of-the-art networks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior results across multiple evaluation metrics, including CD, EMD, DCD,
and F-Score, as well as in human evaluations.

Conclusion: RA-Touch展示了基于检索的视觉数据重用于触觉理解的潜力。

Abstract: Visuo-tactile perception aims to understand an object's tactile properties,
such as texture, softness, and rigidity. However, the field remains
underexplored because collecting tactile data is costly and labor-intensive. We
observe that visually distinct objects can exhibit similar surface textures or
material properties. For example, a leather sofa and a leather jacket have
different appearances but share similar tactile properties. This implies that
tactile understanding can be guided by material cues in visual data, even
without direct tactile supervision. In this paper, we introduce RA-Touch, a
retrieval-augmented framework that improves visuo-tactile perception by
leveraging visual data enriched with tactile semantics. We carefully recaption
a large-scale visual dataset with tactile-focused descriptions, enabling the
model to access tactile semantics typically absent from conventional visual
datasets. A key challenge remains in effectively utilizing these tactile-aware
external descriptions. RA-Touch addresses this by retrieving visual-textual
representations aligned with tactile inputs and integrating them to focus on
relevant textural and material properties. By outperforming prior methods on
the TVL benchmark, our method demonstrates the potential of retrieval-based
visual reuse for tactile understanding. Code is available at

Motivation: 研究目的是通过对比学习和生成对抗网络技术，提升从合成图像生成真实水下图像的质量，解决水下图像生成中的光照和结构保真问题。

Method: 采用了多种图像翻译模型（如pix2pix、CycleGAN、CUT等），并引入深度信息优化CUT模型，通过FID和SSIM指标评估生成图像的质量。

Result: pix2pix在FID上表现最佳，而自编码器在SSIM上最优；CycleGAN在非配对方法中FID表现良好，CUT则在SSIM上更优；加入深度信息的CUT进一步降低了FID。

Conclusion: 深度信息有助于提升生成图像的逼真度，但可能牺牲部分结构保真度；不同模型在不同指标上各有优劣，需根据需求选择。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of contrastive learning and generative
adversarial networks for generating realistic underwater images from synthetic
images with uniform lighting. We investigate the performance of image
translation models for generating realistic underwater images using the VAROS
dataset. Two key evaluation metrics, Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), provide insights into the
trade-offs between perceptual quality and structural preservation. For paired
image translation, pix2pix achieves the best FID scores due to its paired
supervision and PatchGAN discriminator, while the autoencoder model attains the
highest SSIM, suggesting better structural fidelity despite producing blurrier
outputs. Among unpaired methods, CycleGAN achieves a competitive FID score by
leveraging cycle-consistency loss, whereas CUT, which replaces
cycle-consistency with contrastive learning, attains higher SSIM, indicating
improved spatial similarity retention. Notably, incorporating depth information
into CUT results in the lowest overall FID score, demonstrating that depth cues
enhance realism. However, the slight decrease in SSIM suggests that depth-aware
learning may introduce structural variations.

Conclusion: FRT需结合验证、监管及透明度以确保公平性和法医有效性。

Abstract: Facial recognition technology (FRT) is increasingly used in criminal
investigations, yet most evaluations of its accuracy rely on high-quality
images, unlike those often encountered by law enforcement. This study examines
how five common forms of image degradation--contrast, brightness, motion blur,
pose shift, and resolution--affect FRT accuracy and fairness across demographic
groups. Using synthetic faces generated by StyleGAN3 and labeled with FairFace,
we simulate degraded images and evaluate performance using Deepface with
ArcFace loss in 1:n identification tasks. We perform an experiment and find
that false positive rates peak near baseline image quality, while false
negatives increase as degradation intensifies--especially with blur and low
resolution. Error rates are consistently higher for women and Black
individuals, with Black females most affected. These disparities raise concerns
about fairness and reliability when FRT is used in real-world investigative
contexts. Nevertheless, even under the most challenging conditions and for the
most affected subgroups, FRT accuracy remains substantially higher than that of
many traditional forensic methods. This suggests that, if appropriately
validated and regulated, FRT should be considered a valuable investigative
tool. However, algorithmic accuracy alone is not sufficient: we must also
evaluate how FRT is used in practice, including user-driven data manipulation.
Such cases underscore the need for transparency and oversight in FRT deployment
to ensure both fairness and forensic validity.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel inertial localization framework named Egocentric
Action-aware Inertial Localization (EAIL), which leverages egocentric action
cues from head-mounted IMU signals to localize the target individual within a
3D point cloud. Human inertial localization is challenging due to IMU sensor
noise that causes trajectory drift over time. The diversity of human actions
further complicates IMU signal processing by introducing various motion
patterns. Nevertheless, we observe that some actions observed through the
head-mounted IMU correlate with spatial environmental structures (e.g., bending
down to look inside an oven, washing dishes next to a sink), thereby serving as
spatial anchors to compensate for the localization drift. The proposed EAIL
framework learns such correlations via hierarchical multi-modal alignment. By
assuming that the 3D point cloud of the environment is available, it
contrastively learns modality encoders that align short-term egocentric action
cues in IMU signals with local environmental features in the point cloud. These
encoders are then used in reasoning the IMU data and the point cloud over time
and space to perform inertial localization. Interestingly, these encoders can
further be utilized to recognize the corresponding sequence of actions as a
by-product. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework over state-of-the-art inertial localization and inertial action
recognition baselines.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D object synthesis remains significantly more challenging than
2D image generation due to the unstructured nature of mesh data and the cubic
complexity of dense volumetric grids. Existing two-stage pipelines-compressing
meshes with a VAE (using either 2D or 3D supervision), followed by latent
diffusion sampling-often suffer from severe detail loss caused by inefficient
representations and modality mismatches introduced in VAE. We introduce SparC,
a unified framework that combines a sparse deformable marching cubes
representation SparseCubes with a novel encoder SparConv-VAE. SparseCubes
converts raw meshes into high-resolution ($1024^3$) surfaces with arbitrary
topology by scattering signed distance and deformation fields onto a sparse
cube, allowing differentiable optimization. SparConv-VAE is the first
modality-consistent variational autoencoder built entirely upon sparse
convolutional networks, enabling efficient and near-lossless 3D reconstruction
suitable for high-resolution generative modeling through latent diffusion.
SparC achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity on challenging inputs,
including open surfaces, disconnected components, and intricate geometry. It
preserves fine-grained shape details, reduces training and inference cost, and
integrates naturally with latent diffusion models for scalable, high-resolution
3D generation.

Abstract: Brain-to-image decoding has been recently propelled by the progress in
generative AI models and the availability of large ultra-high field functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). However, current approaches depend on
complicated multi-stage pipelines and preprocessing steps that typically
collapse the temporal dimension of brain recordings, thereby limiting
time-resolved brain decoders. Here, we introduce Dynadiff (Dynamic Neural
Activity Diffusion for Image Reconstruction), a new single-stage diffusion
model designed for reconstructing images from dynamically evolving fMRI
recordings. Our approach offers three main contributions. First, Dynadiff
simplifies training as compared to existing approaches. Second, our model
outperforms state-of-the-art models on time-resolved fMRI signals, especially
on high-level semantic image reconstruction metrics, while remaining
competitive on preprocessed fMRI data that collapse time. Third, this approach
allows a precise characterization of the evolution of image representations in
brain activity. Overall, this work lays the foundation for time-resolved

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGPN等现有方法在3D点集实例分割中使用内存密集的相似性矩阵，导致内存占用随点数平方增长，亟需改进。

Method: 采用两种采样方法：在子采样点集上计算实例分割，并通过最近邻方法将标签外推到完整点集。

Result: 两种方法在大子采样集上表现相当，但随机采样策略在速度和内存使用上提升最显著。

Conclusion: 随机采样策略是解决内存问题的有效方法，适用于大规模3D点集实例分割。

Abstract: Recently proposed neural network architectures like PointNet [QSMG16] and
PointNet++ [QYSG17] have made it possible to apply Deep Learning to 3D point
sets. The feature representations of shapes learned by these two networks
enabled training classifiers for Semantic Segmentation, and more recently for
Instance Segmentation via the Similarity Group Proposal Network (SGPN)
[WYHN17]. One area of improvement which has been highlighted by SGPN's authors,
pertains to use of memory intensive similarity matrices which occupy memory
quadratic in the number of points. In this report, we attempt to tackle this
issue through use of two sampling based methods, which compute Instance
Segmentation on a sub-sampled Point Set, and then extrapolate labels to the
complete set using the nearest neigbhour approach. While both approaches
perform equally well on large sub-samples, the random-based strategy gives the
most improvements in terms of speed and memory usage.

Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing a 3D scene from multiple sketches.
We propose a pipeline which involves (1) stitching together multiple sketches
through use of correspondence points, (2) converting the stitched sketch into a
realistic image using a CycleGAN, and (3) estimating that image's depth-map
using a pre-trained convolutional neural network based architecture called
MegaDepth. Our contribution includes constructing a dataset of image-sketch
pairs, the images for which are from the Zurich Building Database, and sketches
have been generated by us. We use this dataset to train a CycleGAN for our
pipeline's second step. We end up with a stitching process that does not
generalize well to real drawings, but the rest of the pipeline that creates a
3D reconstruction from a single sketch performs quite well on a wide variety of
drawings.

Result: 在合成和真实高光谱数据上的实验验证了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过端元束和灵活的正则化提升了高光谱解混的准确性。

Abstract: Due to low spatial resolution, hyperspectral data often consists of mixtures
of contributions from multiple materials. This limitation motivates the task of
hyperspectral unmixing (HU), a fundamental problem in hyperspectral imaging. HU
aims to identify the spectral signatures (\textit{endmembers}) of the materials
present in an observed scene, along with their relative proportions
(\textit{fractional abundance}) in each pixel. A major challenge lies in the
class variability in materials, which hinders accurate representation by a
single spectral signature, as assumed in the conventional linear mixing model.
Moreover, To address this issue, we propose using group sparsity after
representing each material with a set of spectral signatures, known as
endmember bundles, where each group corresponds to a specific material. In
particular, we develop a bundle-based framework that can enforce either
inter-group sparsity or sparsity within and across groups (SWAG) on the
abundance coefficients. Furthermore, our framework offers the flexibility to
incorporate a variety of sparsity-promoting penalties, among which the
transformed $\ell_1$ (TL1) penalty is a novel regularization in the HU
literature. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real
hyperspectral data demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed approaches.

Abstract: Efficient creation of accurate and editable 3D CAD models is critical in
engineering design, significantly impacting cost and time-to-market in product

Abstract: The exponential growth of visual data in digital communications has
intensified the need for efficient compression techniques that balance
rate-distortion performance with computational feasibility. While recent neural
compression approaches have shown promise, they still struggle with fundamental
challenges: preserving perceptual quality at high compression ratios,
computational efficiency, and adaptability to diverse visual content. This
paper introduces GANCompress, a novel neural compression framework that
synergistically combines Binary Spherical Quantization (BSQ) with Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address these challenges. Our approach employs a
transformer-based autoencoder with an enhanced BSQ bottleneck that projects
latent representations onto a hypersphere, enabling efficient discretization
with bounded quantization error. This is followed by a specialized GAN
architecture incorporating frequency-domain attention and color consistency
optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that GANCompress achieves
substantial improvement in compression efficiency -- reducing file sizes by up
to 100x with minimal visual distortion. Our method outperforms traditional
codecs like H.264 by 12-15% in perceptual metrics while maintaining comparable
PSNR/SSIM values, with 2.4x faster encoding and decoding speeds. On standard
benchmarks including ImageNet-1k and COCO2017, GANCompress sets a new
state-of-the-art, reducing FID from 0.72 to 0.41 (43% improvement) compared to
previous methods while maintaining higher throughput. This work presents a

Abstract: This paper explores how the image quality assessment (IQA) task affects the
cognitive processes of people from the perspective of pupil size and studies
the relationship between pupil size and image quality. Specifically, we first
invited subjects to participate in a subjective experiment, which includes two
tasks: free observation and IQA. In the free observation task, subjects did not
need to perform any action, and they only needed to observe images as they
usually do with an album. In the IQA task, subjects were required to score
images according to their overall impression of image quality. Then, by
analyzing the difference in pupil size between the two tasks, we find that
people may activate the visual attention mechanism when evaluating image
quality. Meanwhile, we also find that the change in pupil size is closely
related to image quality in the IQA task. For future research on IQA, this
research can not only provide a theoretical basis for the objective IQA method
and promote the development of more effective objective IQA methods, but also
provide a new subjective IQA method for collecting the authentic subjective
impression of image quality.

Conclusion: 该方法为多角色交互动画提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating large-scale multi-character interactions is a challenging and
important task in character animation. Multi-character interactions involve not
only natural interactive motions but also characters coordinated with each
other for transition. For example, a dance scenario involves characters dancing
with partners and also characters coordinated to new partners based on spatial
and temporal observations. We term such transitions as coordinated interactions
and decompose them into interaction synthesis and transition planning. Previous
methods of single-character animation do not consider interactions that are
critical for multiple characters. Deep-learning-based interaction synthesis
usually focuses on two characters and does not consider transition planning.
Optimization-based interaction synthesis relies on manually designing objective
functions that may not generalize well. While crowd simulation involves more
characters, their interactions are sparse and passive. We identify two
challenges to multi-character interaction synthesis, including the lack of data
and the planning of transitions among close and dense interactions. Existing
datasets either do not have multiple characters or do not have close and dense
interactions. The planning of transitions for multi-character close and dense
interactions needs both spatial and temporal considerations. We propose a
conditional generative pipeline comprising a coordinatable multi-character
interaction space for interaction synthesis and a transition planning network
for coordinations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed pipeline for multicharacter interaction synthesis and the applications
facilitated by our method show the scalability and transferability.

Conclusion: PSGLA是一种有效的非凸势能采样方法，适用于成像逆问题等实际场景。

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling distributions stemming from non-convex
potentials with Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). We prove the stability of
the discrete-time ULA to drift approximations under the assumption that the
potential is strongly convex at infinity. In many context, e.g. imaging inverse
problems, potentials are non-convex and non-smooth. Proximal Stochastic
Gradient Langevin Algorithm (PSGLA) is a popular algorithm to handle such
potentials. It combines the forward-backward optimization algorithm with a ULA
step. Our main stability result combined with properties of the Moreau envelope
allows us to derive the first proof of convergence of the PSGLA for non-convex
potentials. We empirically validate our methodology on synthetic data and in
the context of imaging inverse problems. In particular, we observe that PSGLA
exhibits faster convergence rates than Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm
for posterior sampling while preserving its restoration properties.

Conclusion: 通过两步调制机制和协同优化，显著提升了NVC的性能。

Abstract: Efficient video coding is highly dependent on exploiting the temporal
redundancy, which is usually achieved by extracting and leveraging the temporal
context in the emerging conditional coding-based neural video codec (NVC).
Although the latest NVC has achieved remarkable progress in improving the
compression performance, the inherent temporal context propagation mechanism
lacks the ability to sufficiently leverage the reference information, limiting
further improvement. In this paper, we address the limitation by modulating the
temporal context with the reference frame in two steps. Specifically, we first
propose the flow orientation to mine the inter-correlation between the
reference frame and prediction frame for generating the additional oriented
temporal context. Moreover, we introduce the context compensation to leverage
the oriented context to modulate the propagated temporal context generated from
the propagated reference feature. Through the synergy mechanism and decoupling
loss supervision, the irrelevant propagated information can be effectively
eliminated to ensure better context modeling. Experimental results demonstrate
that our codec achieves on average 22.7% bitrate reduction over the advanced
traditional video codec H.266/VVC, and offers an average 10.1% bitrate saving
over the previous state-of-the-art NVC DCVC-FM. The code is available at

Conclusion: SuperMapNet通过多模态协同和元素交互显著提升了矢量高清地图的构建精度和范围。

Abstract: Vectorized HD map is essential for autonomous driving. Remarkable work has
been achieved in recent years, but there are still major issues: (1) in the
generation of the BEV features, single modality-based methods are of limited
perception capability, while direct concatenation-based multi-modal methods
fail to capture synergies and disparities between different modalities,
resulting in limited ranges with feature holes; (2) in the classification and
localization of map elements, only point information is used without the
consideration of element infor-mation and neglects the interaction between
point information and element information, leading to erroneous shapes and
element entanglement with low accuracy. To address above issues, we introduce
SuperMapNet for long-range and high-accuracy vectorized HD map construction. It
uses both camera images and LiDAR point clouds as input, and first tightly
couple semantic information from camera images and geometric information from
LiDAR point clouds by a cross-attention based synergy enhancement module and a
flow-based disparity alignment module for long-range BEV feature generation.
And then, local features from point queries and global features from element
queries are tightly coupled by three-level interactions for high-accuracy
classification and localization, where Point2Point interaction learns local
geometric information between points of the same element and of each point,
Element2Element interaction learns relation constraints between different
elements and semantic information of each elements, and Point2Element
interaction learns complement element information for its constituent points.
Experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate superior
performances, surpassing SOTAs over 14.9/8.8 mAP and 18.5/3.1 mAP under
hard/easy settings, respectively. The code is made publicly available1.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of 3D scenes is essential for autonomous

a central role by providing a general representation of drivable and occupied
space. However, most existing occupancy estimation methods rely on LiDAR or
cameras, which perform poorly in degraded environments such as smoke, rain,
snow, and fog. In this paper, we propose 4D-ROLLS, the first weakly supervised
occupancy estimation method for 4D radar using the LiDAR point cloud as the
supervisory signal. Specifically, we introduce a method for generating
pseudo-LiDAR labels, including occupancy queries and LiDAR height maps, as
multi-stage supervision to train the 4D radar occupancy estimation model. Then
the model is aligned with the occupancy map produced by LiDAR, fine-tuning its
accuracy in occupancy estimation. Extensive comparative experiments validate
the exceptional performance of 4D-ROLLS. Its robustness in degraded
environments and effectiveness in cross-dataset training are qualitatively
demonstrated. The model is also seamlessly transferred to downstream tasks BEV
segmentation and point cloud occupancy prediction, highlighting its potential
for broader applications. The lightweight network enables 4D-ROLLS model to
achieve fast inference speeds at about 30 Hz on a 4060 GPU. The code of

Abstract: Depth estimation plays a great potential role in obstacle avoidance and
navigation for further Mars exploration missions. Compared to traditional
stereo matching, learning-based stereo depth estimation provides a data-driven
approach to infer dense and precise depth maps from stereo image pairs.
However, these methods always suffer performance degradation in environments
with sparse textures and lacking geometric constraints, such as the
unstructured terrain of Mars. To address these challenges, we propose M3Depth,
a depth estimation model tailored for Mars rovers. Considering the sparse and
smooth texture of Martian terrain, which is primarily composed of low-frequency
features, our model incorporates a convolutional kernel based on wavelet
transform that effectively captures low-frequency response and expands the
receptive field. Additionally, we introduce a consistency loss that explicitly
models the complementary relationship between depth map and surface normal map,
utilizing the surface normal as a geometric constraint to enhance the accuracy
of depth estimation. Besides, a pixel-wise refinement module with mutual

Abstract: Tactile perception is profoundly influenced by the surface properties of
objects in contact. However, despite their crucial role in shaping tactile
experiences, these material characteristics have been largely neglected in
existing tactile representation learning methods. Most approaches primarily
focus on aligning tactile data with visual or textual information, overlooking
the richness of tactile feedback that comes from understanding the materials'
inherent properties. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting the
tactile representation learning framework and incorporating material-aware
priors into the learning process. These priors, which represent pre-learned
characteristics specific to different materials, allow tactile models to better
capture and generalize the nuances of surface texture. Our method enables more
accurate, contextually rich tactile feedback across diverse materials and
textures, improving performance in real-world applications such as robotics,
haptic feedback systems, and material editing.

Result: 在六种数据集和两种面部匹配器上，新方法比现有最优方法性能提升≥59.46%。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了跨技术和风格的泛化，显著提升了实用性和性能。

Abstract: A face morph is created by combining two (or more) face images corresponding
to two (or more) identities to produce a composite that successfully matches
the constituent identities. Reference-free (RF) demorphing reverses this
process using only the morph image, without the need for additional reference
images. Previous RF demorphing methods were overly constrained, as they rely on
assumptions about the distributions of training and testing morphs such as the
morphing technique used, face style, and images used to create the morph. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach that effectively
disentangles component images from a composite morph image with high visual
fidelity. Our method is the first to generalize across morph techniques and
face styles, beating the current state of the art by $\geq 59.46\%$ under a
common training protocol across all datasets tested. We train our method on
morphs created using synthetically generated face images and test on real
morphs, thereby enhancing the practicality of the technique. Experiments on six
datasets and two face matchers establish the utility and efficacy of our
method.

Conclusion: CP-GS为3D场景个性化提供了高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Personalizing 3D scenes from a single reference image enables intuitive
user-guided editing, which requires achieving both multi-view consistency
across perspectives and referential consistency with the input image. However,
these goals are particularly challenging due to the viewpoint bias caused by
the limited perspective provided in a single image. Lacking the mechanisms to
effectively expand reference information beyond the original view, existing
methods of image-conditioned 3DGS personalization often suffer from this
viewpoint bias and struggle to produce consistent results. Therefore, in this
paper, we present Consistent Personalization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (CP-GS),
a framework that progressively propagates the single-view reference appearance
to novel perspectives. In particular, CP-GS integrates pre-trained image-to-3D
generation and iterative LoRA fine-tuning to extract and extend the reference
appearance, and finally produces faithful multi-view guidance images and the
personalized 3DGS outputs through a view-consistent generation process guided
by geometric cues. Extensive experiments on real-world scenes show that our
CP-GS effectively mitigates the viewpoint bias, achieving high-quality
personalization that significantly outperforms existing methods. The code will
be released at https://github.com/Yuxuan-W/CP-GS.

Abstract: Surface-based cortical analysis is valuable for a variety of neuroimaging
tasks, such as spatial normalization, parcellation, and gray matter (GM)
thickness estimation. However, most tools for estimating cortical surfaces work
exclusively on scans with at least 1 mm isotropic resolution and are tuned to a
specific magnetic resonance (MR) contrast, often T1-weighted (T1w). This
precludes application using most clinical MR scans, which are very
heterogeneous in terms of contrast and resolution. Here, we use synthetic
domain-randomized data to train the first neural network for explicit
estimation of cortical surfaces from scans of any contrast and resolution,
without retraining. Our method deforms a template mesh to the white matter (WM)
surface, which guarantees topological correctness. This mesh is further
deformed to estimate the GM surface. We compare our method to
recon-all-clinical (RAC), an implicit surface reconstruction method which is
currently the only other tool capable of processing heterogeneous clinical MR
scans, on ADNI and a large clinical dataset (n=1,332). We show a approximately
50 % reduction in cortical thickness error (from 0.50 to 0.24 mm) with respect
to RAC and better recovery of the aging-related cortical thinning patterns
detected by FreeSurfer on high-resolution T1w scans. Our method enables fast
and accurate surface reconstruction of clinical scans, allowing studies (1)
with sample sizes far beyond what is feasible in a research setting, and (2) of
clinical populations that are difficult to enroll in research studies. The code

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过结合神经场和去噪评分函数，显著提升了逆散射问题的成像效果。

Abstract: Inverse scattering is a fundamental challenge in many imaging applications,
ranging from microscopy to remote sensing. Solving this problem often requires
jointly estimating two unknowns -- the image and the scattering field inside
the object -- necessitating effective image prior to regularize the inference.
In this paper, we propose a regularized neural field (NF) approach which
integrates the denoising score function used in score-based generative models.
The neural field formulation offers convenient flexibility to performing joint
estimation, while the denoising score function imposes the rich structural
prior of images. Our results on three high-contrast simulated objects show that
the proposed approach yields a better imaging quality compared to the
state-of-the-art NF approach, where regularization is based on total variation.

Abstract: Advanced plant phenotyping technologies play a crucial role in targeted trait
improvement and accelerating intelligent breeding. Due to the species diversity
of plants, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale high-precision manually
annotated data. For self-occluded objects at the grain level, unsupervised
methods often prove ineffective. This study proposes IPENS, an interactive
unsupervised multi-target point cloud extraction method. The method utilizes
radiance field information to lift 2D masks, which are segmented by SAM2
(Segment Anything Model 2), into 3D space for target point cloud extraction. A
multi-target collaborative optimization strategy is designed to effectively
resolve the single-interaction multi-target segmentation challenge.
Experimental validation demonstrates that IPENS achieves a grain-level
segmentation accuracy (mIoU) of 63.72% on a rice dataset, with strong
phenotypic estimation capabilities: grain volume prediction yields R2 = 0.7697
(RMSE = 0.0025), leaf surface area R2 = 0.84 (RMSE = 18.93), and leaf length
and width predictions achieve R2 = 0.97 and 0.87 (RMSE = 1.49 and 0.21). On a
wheat dataset,IPENS further improves segmentation accuracy to 89.68% (mIoU),
with equally outstanding phenotypic estimation performance: spike volume
prediction achieves R2 = 0.9956 (RMSE = 0.0055), leaf surface area R2 = 1.00
(RMSE = 0.67), and leaf length and width predictions reach R2 = 0.99 and 0.92
(RMSE = 0.23 and 0.15). This method provides a non-invasive, high-quality
phenotyping extraction solution for rice and wheat. Without requiring annotated
data, it rapidly extracts grain-level point clouds within 3 minutes through
simple single-round interactions on images for multiple targets, demonstrating
significant potential to accelerate intelligent breeding efficiency.

Abstract: The ThinPrep Cytologic Test (TCT) is the most widely used method for cervical
cancer screening, and the sample quality directly impacts the accuracy of the
diagnosis. Traditional manual evaluation methods rely on the observation of
pathologist under microscopes. These methods exhibit high subjectivity, high
cost, long duration, and low reliability. With the development of
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), an automated quality assessment system that
performs at the level of a professional pathologist is necessary. To address
this need, we propose a fully automated quality assessment method for Cervical
Cytopathology Whole Slide Images (WSIs) based on The Bethesda System (TBS)
diagnostic standards, artificial intelligence algorithms, and the
characteristics of clinical data. The method analysis the context of WSIs to
quantify quality evaluation metrics which are focused by TBS such as staining
quality, cell counts and cell mass proportion through multiple models including
object detection, classification and segmentation. Subsequently, the XGBoost
model is used to mine the attention paid by pathologists to different quality
evaluation metrics when evaluating samples, thereby obtaining a comprehensive
WSI sample score calculation model. Experimental results on 100 WSIs
demonstrate that the proposed evaluation method has significant advantages in
terms of speed and consistency.

Abstract: The International Society of Ultrasound advocates Intrapartum Ultrasound (US)
Imaging in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) to monitor labour progression
through changes in fetal head position. Two reliable ultrasound-derived
parameters that are used to predict outcomes of instrumental vaginal delivery
are the angle of progression (AoP) and head-symphysis distance (HSD). In this
work, as part of the Intrapartum Ultrasounds Grand Challenge (IUGC) 2024, we
propose an automated fetal biometry measurement pipeline to reduce intra- and
inter-observer variability and improve measurement reliability. Our pipeline
consists of three key tasks: (i) classification of standard planes (SP) from US
videos, (ii) segmentation of fetal head and pubic symphysis from the detected
SPs, and (iii) computation of the AoP and HSD from the segmented regions. We
perform sparse sampling to mitigate class imbalances and reduce spurious
correlations in task (i), and utilize ensemble-based deep learning methods for
task (i) and (ii) to enhance generalizability under different US acquisition
settings. Finally, to promote robustness in task iii) with respect to the
structural fidelity of measurements, we retain the largest connected components
and apply ellipse fitting to the segmentations. Our solution achieved ACC:

Abstract: This paper introduces a discriminator-free adversarial-based approach termed
DDA-MLIC for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in the context of Multi-Label
Image Classification (MLIC). While recent efforts have explored
adversarial-based UDA methods for MLIC, they typically include an additional
discriminator subnet. Nevertheless, decoupling the classification and the
discrimination tasks may harm their task-specific discriminative power. Herein,
we address this challenge by presenting a novel adversarial critic directly
derived from the task-specific classifier. Specifically, we employ a
two-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to model both source and target
predictions, distinguishing between two distinct clusters. Instead of using the
traditional Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, our approach utilizes a
Deep Neural Network (DNN) to estimate the parameters of each GMM component.
Subsequently, the source and target GMM parameters are leveraged to formulate
an adversarial loss using the Fr\'echet distance. The proposed framework is
therefore not only fully differentiable but is also cost-effective as it avoids
the expensive iterative process usually induced by the standard EM method. The
proposed method is evaluated on several multi-label image datasets covering
three different types of domain shift. The obtained results demonstrate that
DDA-MLIC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision
while requiring a lower number of parameters. The code is made publicly

Conclusion: RLoT通过动态逻辑块选择和强化学习，显著提升LLM推理能力，并展示强泛化性。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), the token-level
autoregressive nature constrains their complex reasoning capabilities. To
enhance LLM reasoning, inference-time techniques, including
Chain/Tree/Graph-of-Thought(s), successfully improve the performance, as they
are fairly cost-effective by guiding reasoning through sophisticated logical
structures without modifying LLMs' parameters. However, these manually
predefined, task-agnostic frameworks are applied uniformly across diverse
tasks, lacking adaptability. To improve this, we propose RL-of-Thoughts (RLoT),
where we train a lightweight navigator model with reinforcement learning (RL)
to adaptively enhance LLM reasoning at inference time. Specifically, we design
five basic logic blocks from the perspective of human cognition. During the
reasoning process, the trained RL navigator dynamically selects the suitable
logic blocks and combines them into task-specific logical structures according
to problem characteristics. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks
(AIME, MATH, GPQA, etc.) with multiple LLMs (GPT, Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek)
illustrate that RLoT outperforms established inference-time techniques by up to
13.4%. Remarkably, with less than 3K parameters, our RL navigator is able to
make sub-10B LLMs comparable to 100B-scale counterparts. Moreover, the RL
navigator demonstrates strong transferability: a model trained on one specific
LLM-task pair can effectively generalize to unseen LLMs and tasks. Our code is
open-source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RL-LLM-Reasoning-1A30 for

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures within Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)

existing reasoning models often suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like
overthinking and underthinking. To address these limitations, we introduce a
novel inference-time steering methodology called Reinforcing Cognitive Experts
(RICE), designed to improve reasoning performance without additional training
or complex heuristics. Leveraging normalized Pointwise Mutual Information
(nPMI), we systematically identify specialized experts, termed ''cognitive
experts'' that orchestrate meta-level reasoning operations characterized by
tokens like ''<think>''. Empirical evaluations with leading MoE-based LRMs
(DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B) on rigorous quantitative and scientific reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate noticeable and consistent improvements in reasoning
accuracy, cognitive efficiency, and cross-domain generalization. Crucially, our
lightweight approach substantially outperforms prevalent reasoning-steering
techniques, such as prompt design and decoding constraints, while preserving
the model's general instruction-following skills. These results highlight
reinforcing cognitive experts as a promising, practical, and interpretable
direction to enhance cognitive efficiency within advanced reasoning models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transformative not only for daily activities
but also for engineering tasks. However, current evaluations of LLMs in
engineering exhibit two critical shortcomings: (i) the reliance on simplified
use cases, often adapted from examination materials where correctness is easily
verifiable, and (ii) the use of ad hoc scenarios that insufficiently capture
critical engineering competencies. Consequently, the assessment of LLMs on
complex, real-world engineering problems remains largely unexplored. This paper
addresses this gap by introducing a curated database comprising over 100
questions derived from authentic, production-oriented engineering scenarios,
systematically designed to cover core competencies such as product design,
prognosis, and diagnosis. Using this dataset, we evaluate four state-of-the-art
LLMs, including both cloud-based and locally hosted instances, to
systematically investigate their performance on complex engineering tasks. Our
results show that LLMs demonstrate strengths in basic temporal and structural
reasoning but struggle significantly with abstract reasoning, formal modeling,
and context-sensitive engineering logic.

Abstract: This study explores Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents for
real-world tasks, including freelance software development. This work presents
a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs on freelance programming and data analysis
tasks derived from economic data. We construct the benchmark using synthetic
tasks created from a Kaggle Freelancer dataset of job postings, with all job
prices standardized to USD (median fixed-project price around $250, and an
average of $306). Each task is accompanied by structured input-output test
cases and an estimated price tag, enabling automated correctness checking and a
monetary performance valuation. This approach is inspired by OpenAI's recent
SWE-Lancer benchmark (1,400 real Upwork tasks worth $1M total). Still, our
framework simplifies evaluation using programmatically testable tasks and
predicted price values, making it highly scalable and repeatable. On this
benchmark, we evaluate four modern LLMs - Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o-mini, Qwen
2.5, and Mistral. We report each model's accuracy (task success rate and
test-case pass rate) and the total "freelance earnings" it achieves (sum of
prices of solved tasks). Our results show that Claude 3.5 Haiku performs best,
earning approximately $1.52 million USD, followed closely by GPT-4o-mini at
$1.49 million, then Qwen 2.5 ($1.33M) and Mistral ($0.70M). We analyze the
distribution of errors per task and observe that the strongest models solve the
most tasks and rarely fail completely on any project. We discuss the
implications of these results for the feasibility of AI as a freelance
developer, the advantages and limitations of our automated benchmark approach,
and the gap between performance on structured tasks versus the true complexity

Abstract: Automatic prompt generation plays a crucial role in enabling general-purpose
multi-agent systems to perform diverse tasks autonomously. Existing methods
typically evaluate prompts based on their immediate task performance,
overlooking the intrinsic qualities that determine their reliability. This
outcome-centric view not only limits interpretability but also fails to account
for the inherent stochasticity of large language models (LLMs). In this work,
we bring attention to prompt stability-the consistency of model responses
across repeated executions-as a key factor for building robust and effective
prompt generation systems. To quantify this, we propose semantic stability as a
criterion for assessing the response consistency of prompts, and fine-tune a
LLaMA-based evaluator to measure it automatically across tasks. These
components have enabled us to develop the first stability-aware general-purpose
prompt generation system that leverages stability feedback to iteratively
enhance both prompt quality and system-level performance. Furthermore, we
establish a logical chain between prompt stability and task success by
analyzing the structural dependencies within our system, proving stability as a
necessary condition for effective system-level execution. Empirical results
across general and domain-specific tasks demonstrate that our stability-aware
framework improves both accuracy and output consistency. By shifting the focus
from one-off results to persistent reliability, our work offers a new
perspective on prompt design and contributes practical tools for building more
trustworthy general-purpose systems.

Result: LLMs的成功支持了语言对推理能力的显著提升，表明语言编码的抽象性和效率是关键。

Conclusion: 语言训练显著提升了AI系统的推理能力，这一结果也对人类生物思维中语言的作用提供了启示。

Abstract: Daniel Dennett speculated in *Kinds of Minds* 1996: "Perhaps the kind of mind
you get when you add language to it is so different from the kind of mind you
can have without language that calling them both minds is a mistake." Recent
work in AI can be seen as testing Dennett's thesis by exploring the performance
of AI systems with and without linguistic training. I argue that the success of
Large Language Models at inferential reasoning, limited though it may be,
supports Dennett's radical view about the effect of language on thought. I
suggest it is the abstractness and efficiency of linguistic encoding that lies
behind the capacity of LLMs to perform inferences across a wide range of
domains. In a slogan, language makes inference computationally tractable. I
assess what these results in AI indicate about the role of language in the
workings of our own biological minds.

Conclusion: 结构化搜索为语言模型推理提供了高效替代方案，未来可推动更高效的模型部署。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful alternative to parameter
scaling for improving language model performance on complex reasoning tasks.
While existing methods have shown strong performance gains under fixed compute
budgets, there has been little focus on optimally utilizing that budget during
inference. In this work, we introduce A*-decoding, a search-based
inference-time strategy that builds on the A* search algorithm to optimally
utilize a fixed compute budget by prioritizing high-quality reasoning paths
during generation. We frame language model decoding as a structured search in a
state space of partial solutions, applying the A* transition model to identify
promising continuations guided by an external process supervision signal. In
our experiments, A*-decoding reaches the performance levels of strong inference
scaling baselines like best-of-N and particle filtering while using up to 3x
fewer tokens and 30% fewer PRM passes under equivalent compute budgets. On the
MATH500 and AIME 2024 benchmarks, A*-decoding enables Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct to
match the performance of the 70x larger Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, and allows
Qwen3-1.7B to reach o1-like reasoning accuracy. These results highlight the
power of structured search in decoding, offering an alternative to brute-force
sampling or scale-driven gains. Our work demonstrates how thoughtful
inference-time strategies can enhance reasoning in SLMs, pointing toward future
advances in more efficient and scalable language model deployment.

Method: 两阶段训练：1) 使用玩具领域（K&K逻辑谜题）预热模型；2) 在预热模型上应用RLVR训练。

Result: 预热阶段提升泛化推理能力；预热后模型在小数据集上表现更优；保持跨领域泛化性；提升RLVR样本效率。

Conclusion: 预热策略在数据稀缺环境下构建稳健推理LLM具有潜力。

Abstract: Designing effective reasoning-capable LLMs typically requires training using
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) or distillation with
carefully curated Long Chain of Thoughts (CoT), both of which depend heavily on
extensive training data. This creates a major challenge when the amount of
quality training data is scarce. We propose a sample-efficient, two-stage
training strategy to develop reasoning LLMs under limited supervision. In the
first stage, we "warm up" the model by distilling Long CoTs from a toy domain,
namely, Knights \& Knaves (K\&K) logic puzzles to acquire general reasoning
skills. In the second stage, we apply RLVR to the warmed-up model using a
limited set of target-domain examples. Our experiments demonstrate that this
two-phase approach offers several benefits: $(i)$ the warmup phase alone
facilitates generalized reasoning, leading to performance improvements across a
range of tasks, including MATH, HumanEval$^{+}$, and MMLU-Pro. $(ii)$ When both
the base model and the warmed-up model are RLVR trained on the same small
dataset ($\leq100$ examples), the warmed-up model consistently outperforms the
base model; $(iii)$ Warming up before RLVR training allows a model to maintain
cross-domain generalizability even after training on a specific domain; $(iv)$
Introducing warmup in the pipeline improves not only accuracy but also overall
sample efficiency during RLVR training. The results in this paper highlight the
promise of warmup for building robust reasoning LLMs in data-scarce
environments.

Method: CHG通过学习软门控机制对注意力头进行分类，无需假设或标签，适用于任何数据集。还引入了对比CHG以隔离特定任务组件的子电路。

Result: 在Llama 3模型家族和多样任务中验证了CHG的有效性，发现LLMs包含稀疏且足够的子电路，头角色依赖于交互（低模块化），指令跟随和上下文学习依赖可分离机制。

Conclusion: CHG提供了一种直接且可扩展的方法来理解注意力头的因果作用，揭示了LLMs内部机制的复杂性。

Abstract: We present causal head gating (CHG), a scalable method for interpreting the
functional roles of attention heads in transformer models. CHG learns soft
gates over heads and assigns them a causal taxonomy - facilitating,
interfering, or irrelevant - based on their impact on task performance. Unlike
prior approaches in mechanistic interpretability, which are hypothesis-driven
and require prompt templates or target labels, CHG applies directly to any
dataset using standard next-token prediction. We evaluate CHG across multiple
large language models (LLMs) in the Llama 3 model family and diverse tasks,
including syntax, commonsense, and mathematical reasoning, and show that CHG
scores yield causal - not merely correlational - insight, validated via
ablation and causal mediation analyses. We also introduce contrastive CHG, a
variant that isolates sub-circuits for specific task components. Our findings
reveal that LLMs contain multiple sparse, sufficient sub-circuits, that
individual head roles depend on interactions with others (low modularity), and
that instruction following and in-context learning rely on separable
mechanisms.

Method: 采用神经科学启发的神经反馈范式，通过句子-标签对训练LLMs报告和控制其内部激活模式。

Result: LLMs能够学习报告和控制激活模式，但能力受示例数量、目标神经方向的语义可解释性和方差解释度影响。

Conclusion: LLMs的元认知能力有限，仅能监控部分神经机制，这对AI安全有重要启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes report the strategies they
actually use to solve tasks, but they can also fail to do so. This suggests
some degree of metacognition -- the capacity to monitor one's own cognitive
processes for subsequent reporting and self-control. Metacognitive abilities
enhance AI capabilities but raise safety concerns, as models might obscure
their internal processes to evade neural-activation-based oversight mechanisms
designed to detect harmful behaviors. Given society's increased reliance on
these models, it is critical that we understand the limits of their
metacognitive abilities, particularly their ability to monitor their internal
activations. To address this, we introduce a neuroscience-inspired
neurofeedback paradigm designed to quantify the ability of LLMs to explicitly
report and control their activation patterns. By presenting models with
sentence-label pairs where labels correspond to sentence-elicited internal
activations along specific directions in the neural representation space, we
demonstrate that LLMs can learn to report and control these activations. The
performance varies with several factors: the number of example pairs provided,
the semantic interpretability of the target neural direction, and the variance
explained by that direction. These results reveal a "metacognitive space" with
dimensionality much lower than the model's neural space, suggesting LLMs can
monitor only a subset of their neural mechanisms. Our findings provide
empirical evidence quantifying metacognitive capabilities in LLMs, with
significant implications for AI safety.

Motivation: 确保LRMs中间推理过程的忠实性对于可靠监控、解释和有效控制至关重要。

Method: 提出两种互补维度的评估方法：1）内部草案忠实性（评估推理步骤间的因果影响）；2）草案到答案的忠实性（评估最终答案与草案的逻辑一致性）。

Result: 实验表明，当前LRMs在中间推理步骤和草案结论的忠实性上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要进一步提升LRMs的忠实性和可解释性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities
in complex problem-solving by introducing a thinking draft that enables
multi-path Chain-of-Thought explorations before producing final answers.
Ensuring the faithfulness of these intermediate reasoning processes is crucial
for reliable monitoring, interpretation, and effective control. In this paper,
we propose a systematic counterfactual intervention framework to rigorously
evaluate thinking draft faithfulness. Our approach focuses on two complementary
dimensions: (1) Intra-Draft Faithfulness, which assesses whether individual
reasoning steps causally influence subsequent steps and the final draft
conclusion through counterfactual step insertions; and (2) Draft-to-Answer
Faithfulness, which evaluates whether final answers are logically consistent
with and dependent on the thinking draft, by perturbing the draft's concluding
logic. We conduct extensive experiments across six state-of-the-art LRMs. Our
findings show that current LRMs demonstrate selective faithfulness to
intermediate reasoning steps and frequently fail to faithfully align with the
draft conclusions. These results underscore the need for more faithful and
interpretable reasoning in advanced LRMs.

Result: 实验表明CoIn作为第三方审计工具，检测令牌计数膨胀的成功率高达94.7%。

Conclusion: CoIn能有效恢复LLM服务的账单透明度。

Abstract: As post-training techniques evolve, large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly augmented with structured multi-step reasoning abilities, often
optimized through reinforcement learning. These reasoning-enhanced models
outperform standard LLMs on complex tasks and now underpin many commercial LLM
APIs. However, to protect proprietary behavior and reduce verbosity, providers
typically conceal the reasoning traces while returning only the final answer.
This opacity introduces a critical transparency gap: users are billed for
invisible reasoning tokens, which often account for the majority of the cost,
yet have no means to verify their authenticity. This opens the door to token
count inflation, where providers may overreport token usage or inject
synthetic, low-effort tokens to inflate charges. To address this issue, we
propose CoIn, a verification framework that audits both the quantity and
semantic validity of hidden tokens. CoIn constructs a verifiable hash tree from
token embedding fingerprints to check token counts, and uses embedding-based
relevance matching to detect fabricated reasoning content. Experiments
demonstrate that CoIn, when deployed as a trusted third-party auditor, can
effectively detect token count inflation with a success rate reaching up to
94.7%, showing the strong ability to restore billing transparency in opaque LLM
services. The dataset and code are available at

Conclusion: Vittle通过追求最小充分表示学习，为MLLMs在分布偏移下的鲁棒性提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite widespread adoption, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) suffer
performance degradation when encountering unfamiliar queries under distribution
shifts. Existing methods to improve MLLM generalization typically require
either more instruction data or larger advanced model architectures, both of
which incur non-trivial human labor or computational costs. In this work, we
take an alternative approach to enhance the robustness of MLLMs under
distribution shifts, from a representation learning perspective. Inspired by
the information bottleneck (IB) principle, we derive a variational lower bound
of the IB for MLLMs and devise a practical implementation, Visual Instruction
Bottleneck Tuning (Vittle). We then provide a theoretical justification of
Vittle by revealing its connection to an information-theoretic robustness
metric of MLLM. Empirical validation of three MLLMs on open-ended and
closed-form question answering and object hallucination detection tasks over 45
datasets, including 30 shift scenarios, demonstrates that Vittle consistently
improves the MLLM's robustness under shifts by pursuing the learning of a
minimal sufficient representation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems empower large language models

trade-offs when scaling to large knowledge graphs. Existing approaches often
rely on monolithic graph retrieval, incurring unnecessary latency for simple
queries and fragmented reasoning for complex multi-hop questions. To address
these challenges, this paper propose SPLIT-RAG, a multi-agent RAG framework
that addresses these limitations with question-driven semantic graph
partitioning and collaborative subgraph retrieval. The innovative framework
first create Semantic Partitioning of Linked Information, then use the
Type-Specialized knowledge base to achieve Multi-Agent RAG. The attribute-aware
graph segmentation manages to divide knowledge graphs into semantically
coherent subgraphs, ensuring subgraphs align with different query types, while
lightweight LLM agents are assigned to partitioned subgraphs, and only relevant
partitions are activated during retrieval, thus reduce search space while
enhancing efficiency. Finally, a hierarchical merging module resolves
inconsistencies across subgraph-derived answers through logical verifications.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements
compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems empower large language models

enabled LLMs to act as search agents via reinforcement learning (RL), improving
information acquisition through multi-turn interactions with retrieval engines.
However, existing approaches either optimize retrieval using search-only
metrics (e.g., NDCG) that ignore downstream utility or fine-tune the entire LLM
to jointly reason and retrieve-entangling retrieval with generation and
limiting the real search utility and compatibility with frozen or proprietary
models. In this work, we propose s3, a lightweight, model-agnostic framework
that decouples the searcher from the generator and trains the searcher using a
Gain Beyond RAG reward: the improvement in generation accuracy over naive RAG.
s3 requires only 2.4k training samples to outperform baselines trained on over
70x more data, consistently delivering stronger downstream performance across
six general QA and five medical QA benchmarks.

reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). SHARP encompasses a
strategic set of self-alignment principles -- targeting graduate and
Olympiad-level difficulty, rigorous logical consistency, and unambiguous,
verifiable answers -- and a structured three-phase framework (Alignment,
Instantiation, Inference) that ensures thematic diversity and fine-grained
control over problem generation. We implement SHARP by leveraging a
state-of-the-art LRM to infer and verify challenging STEM questions, then
employ a reinforcement learning loop to refine the model's reasoning through
verifiable reward signals. Experiments on benchmarks such as GPQA demonstrate
that SHARP-augmented training substantially outperforms existing methods,
markedly improving complex reasoning accuracy and pushing LRM performance
closer to expert-level proficiency. Our contributions include the SHARP
strategy, framework design, end-to-end implementation, and experimental
evaluation of its effectiveness in elevating LRM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown promising performance in
generating code for solving complex data science problems. Recent studies
primarily focus on enhancing in-context learning through improved search,
sampling, and planning techniques, while overlooking the importance of the
order in which problems are tackled during inference. In this work, we develop
a novel inference-time optimization framework, referred to as DSMentor, which
leverages curriculum learning -- a strategy that introduces simpler task first
and progressively moves to more complex ones as the learner improves -- to
enhance LLM agent performance in challenging data science tasks. Our
mentor-guided framework organizes data science tasks in order of increasing
difficulty and incorporates a growing long-term memory to retain prior
experiences, guiding the agent's learning progression and enabling more
effective utilization of accumulated knowledge. We evaluate DSMentor through
extensive experiments on DSEval and QRData benchmarks. Experiments show that
DSMentor using Claude-3.5-Sonnet improves the pass rate by up to 5.2% on DSEval
and QRData compared to baseline agents. Furthermore, DSMentor demonstrates
stronger causal reasoning ability, improving the pass rate by 8.8% on the
causality problems compared to GPT-4 using Program-of-Thoughts prompts. Our
work underscores the importance of developing effective strategies for
accumulating and utilizing knowledge during inference, mirroring the human
learning process and opening new avenues for improving LLM performance through
curriculum-based inference optimization.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) enhances overall accuracy but fails to improve capability, while
distillation can improve both. In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms
behind these phenomena. First, we demonstrate that RLVR does not improve
capability because it focuses on improving the accuracy of the less-difficult
questions to the detriment of the accuracy of the most difficult questions,
thereby leading to no improvement in capability. Second, we find that RLVR does
not merely increase the success probability for the less difficult questions,
but in our small model settings produces quality responses that were absent in
its output distribution before training. In addition, we show these responses
are neither noticeably longer nor feature more reflection-related keywords,
underscoring the need for more reliable indicators of response quality. Third,
we show that while distillation reliably improves accuracy by learning strong
reasoning patterns, it only improves capability when new knowledge is
introduced. Moreover, when distilling only with reasoning patterns and no new
knowledge, the accuracy of the less-difficult questions improves to the
detriment of the most difficult questions, similar to RLVR. Together, these
findings offer a clearer understanding of how RLVR and distillation shape
reasoning behavior in language models.

challenges: (1) identifying true causal indicators rather than surface
correlations, and (2) preventing advanced models from deception -- deliberately
evading monitoring systems. Hence, we approach this problem from an
unsupervised lens by drawing parallels to human deception: just as humans
exhibit physical indicators while lying, we investigate whether LLMs display
distinct internal behavioral signatures when generating harmful content. Our
study addresses two critical challenges: 1) designing monitoring systems that
capture true causal indicators rather than superficial correlations; and
2)preventing intentional evasion by increasingly capable "Future models''. Our
findings show that models can produce harmful content through causal mechanisms
and can become deceptive by: (a) alternating between linear and non-linear
representations, and (b) modifying feature relationships. To counter this, we
developed Safety-Net -- a multi-detector framework that monitors different
representation dimensions, successfully detecting harmful behavior even when
information is shifted across representational spaces to evade individual
monitors. Our evaluation shows 96% accuracy in detecting harmful cases using
our unsupervised ensemble approach.

Abstract: Many studies focus on data annotation techniques for training effective PRMs.
However, current methods encounter a significant issue when applied to long CoT
reasoning processes: they tend to focus solely on the first incorrect step and
all preceding steps, assuming that all subsequent steps are incorrect. These
methods overlook the unique self-correction and reflection mechanisms inherent
in long CoT, where correct reasoning steps may still occur after initial
reasoning mistakes. To address this issue, we propose a novel data annotation
method for PRMs specifically designed to score the long CoT reasoning process.
Given that under the reflection pattern, correct and incorrect steps often
alternate, we introduce the concepts of Error Propagation and Error Cessation,
enhancing PRMs' ability to identify both effective self-correction behaviors
and reasoning based on erroneous steps. Leveraging an LLM-based judger for
annotation, we collect 1.7 million data samples to train a 7B PRM and evaluate
it at both solution and step levels. Experimental results demonstrate that
compared to existing open-source PRMs and PRMs trained on open-source datasets,
our PRM achieves superior performance across various metrics, including search
guidance, BoN, and F1 scores. Compared to widely used MC-based annotation
methods, our annotation approach not only achieves higher data efficiency but
also delivers superior performance. Detailed analysis is also conducted to
demonstrate the stability and generalizability of our method.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed code
generation from natural language queries. However, despite their extensive
knowledge and ability to produce high-quality code, LLMs often struggle with
contextual accuracy, particularly in evolving codebases. Current code search
and retrieval methods frequently lack robustness in both the quality and
contextual relevance of retrieved results, leading to suboptimal code
generation. This paper introduces a novel knowledge graph-based approach to
improve code search and retrieval leading to better quality of code generation
in the context of repository-level tasks. The proposed approach represents code
repositories as graphs, capturing structural and relational information for
enhanced context-aware code generation. Our framework employs a hybrid approach
for code retrieval to improve contextual relevance, track inter-file modular
dependencies, generate more robust code and ensure consistency with the
existing codebase. We benchmark the proposed approach on the Evolutionary Code
Benchmark (EvoCodeBench) dataset, a repository-level code generation benchmark,
and demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baseline
approach. These findings suggest that knowledge graph based code generation
could advance robust, context-sensitive coding assistance tools.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift
from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of
rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets
becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable
components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary
existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply
equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential
learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy
Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline
RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2)
consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and
3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps
within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms
baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the
same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating
robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.

Abstract: Effective prompt engineering remains a central challenge in fully harnessing

performance, crafting them typically demands expert intuition and a nuanced

subtle semantic cues, ones that may elude human perception but are crucial for
guiding LLM behavior. In this paper, we introduce PRL (Prompts from

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have demonstrated promising results in
mathematical reasoning, but existing process annotation approaches, whether
through human annotations or Monte Carlo simulations, remain computationally
expensive. In this paper, we introduce Step COmpression for Process Estimation

annotation costs. We first translate natural language reasoning steps into code
and normalize them through Abstract Syntax Tree, then merge equivalent steps to
construct a prefix tree. Unlike simulation-based methods that waste numerous
samples on estimation, SCOPE leverages a compression-based prefix tree where
each root-to-leaf path serves as a training sample, reducing the complexity
from $O(NMK)$ to $O(N)$. We construct a large-scale dataset containing 196K

strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a
proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1)
we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a
formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping
the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly
improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both
analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More
broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could
dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking
complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require
trustworthiness.

Abstract: Despite their strengths, large language models (LLMs) often fail to
communicate their confidence accurately, making it difficult to assess when
they might be wrong and limiting their reliability. In this work, we
demonstrate that reasoning models-LLMs that engage in extended chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning-exhibit superior performance not only in problem-solving but
also in accurately expressing their confidence. Specifically, we benchmark six
reasoning models across six datasets and find that they achieve strictly better
confidence calibration than their non-reasoning counterparts in 33 out of the
36 settings. Our detailed analysis reveals that these gains in calibration stem
from the slow thinking behaviors of reasoning models-such as exploring
alternative approaches and backtracking-which enable them to adjust their
confidence dynamically throughout their CoT, making it progressively more
accurate. In particular, we find that reasoning models become increasingly
better calibrated as their CoT unfolds, a trend not observed in non-reasoning
models. Moreover, removing slow thinking behaviors from the CoT leads to a
significant drop in calibration. Lastly, we show that these gains are not
exclusive to reasoning models-non-reasoning models also benefit when guided to
perform slow thinking via in-context learning.

Conclusion: 挑战了依赖LLM的自动路由，推荐WideMLP和fastText作为实用选择。

Abstract: Query routing, the task to route user queries to different large language
model (LLM) endpoints, can be considered as a text classification problem.
However, out-of-distribution queries must be handled properly, as those could
be questions about unrelated domains, queries in other languages, or even
contain unsafe text. Here, we thus study a \emph{guarded} query routing
problem, for which we first introduce the Guarded Query Routing Benchmark
(GQR-Bench), which covers three exemplary target domains (law, finance, and
healthcare), and seven datasets to test robustness against out-of-distribution
queries. We then use GQR-Bench to contrast the effectiveness and efficiency of
LLM-based routing mechanisms (GPT-4o-mini, Llama-3.2-3B, and Llama-3.1-8B),
standard LLM-based guardrail approaches (LlamaGuard and NVIDIA NeMo
Guardrails), continuous bag-of-words classifiers (WideMLP, fastText), and
traditional machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost). Our results show that
WideMLP, enhanced with out-of-domain detection capabilities, yields the best
trade-off between accuracy (88\%) and speed (<4ms). The embedding-based
fastText excels at speed (<1ms) with acceptable accuracy (80\%), whereas LLMs
yield the highest accuracy (91\%) but are comparatively slow (62ms for local
Llama-3.1:8B and 669ms for remote GPT-4o-mini calls). Our findings challenge
the automatic reliance on LLMs for (guarded) query routing and provide concrete
recommendations for practical applications. GQR-Bench will be released as a
Python package -- \texttt{gqr}.

Conclusion: SBT框架有效解决了过度推理问题，减少了计算开销，为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have
significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities by generating longer chains
of thought, demonstrating outstanding performance across a variety of tasks.
However, this performance gain comes at the cost of a substantial increase in
redundant reasoning during the generation process, leading to high
computational overhead and exacerbating the issue of overthinking. Although
numerous existing approaches aim to address the problem of overthinking, they
often rely on external interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, Self-Braking Tuning (SBT), which tackles overthinking from the
perspective of allowing the model to regulate its own reasoning process, thus
eliminating the reliance on external control mechanisms. We construct a set of
overthinking identification metrics based on standard answers and design a
systematic method to detect redundant reasoning. This method accurately
identifies unnecessary steps within the reasoning trajectory and generates
training signals for learning self-regulation behaviors. Building on this
foundation, we develop a complete strategy for constructing data with adaptive
reasoning lengths and introduce an innovative braking prompt mechanism that
enables the model to naturally learn when to terminate reasoning at an
appropriate point. Experiments across mathematical benchmarks (AIME, AMC,
MATH500, GSM8K) demonstrate that our method reduces token consumption by up to
60% while maintaining comparable accuracy to unconstrained models.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain expertise across diverse domains and
modalities, scalable oversight becomes increasingly challenging, particularly
when their capabilities may surpass human evaluators. Debate has emerged as a
promising mechanism for enabling such oversight. In this work, we extend the
debate paradigm to a multimodal setting, exploring its potential for weaker
models to supervise and enhance the performance of stronger models. We focus on
visual question answering (VQA), where two "sighted" expert vision-language
models debate an answer, while a "blind" (text-only) judge adjudicates based
solely on the quality of the arguments. In our framework, the experts defend
only answers aligned with their beliefs, thereby obviating the need for
explicit role-playing and concentrating the debate on instances of expert
disagreement. Experiments on several multimodal tasks demonstrate that the
debate framework consistently outperforms individual expert models. Moreover,
judgments from weaker LLMs can help instill reasoning capabilities in
vision-language models through finetuning.

failing to stay within strict budgets. In this paper, we introduce
Cost-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (CATS), a novel approach that brings
explicit cost-awareness into LLM-guided planning. Tight cost constraints push
the planner to quickly identify infeasible solutions, while looser constraints
encourage optimization for minimal cost. We benchmark top LLMs such as GPT-4.1,
Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1, against our CATS planner to evaluate their
performance in cost-sensitive scenarios. Our experiments suggest that raw LLMs
such as GPT-4.1 often falter under tight budgets, whereas CATS consistently

the start of their reasoning, in response to harmful prompts, while leaving the
rest of the reasoning process unsupervised. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks indicate that SAFEPATH effectively reduces harmful outputs while
maintaining reasoning performance. Specifically, SAFEPATH reduces harmful
responses by up to 90.0% and blocks 83.3% of jailbreak attempts in the
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model, while requiring 295.9x less compute than
Direct Refusal and 314.1x less than SafeChain. We further introduce a zero-shot

proactive notifications, leading to suboptimal user intent understanding and
limited functionality for proactive service. In this paper, we introduce
ContextAgent, the first context-aware proactive agent that incorporates
extensive sensory contexts to enhance the proactive capabilities of LLM agents.
ContextAgent first extracts multi-dimensional contexts from massive sensory
perceptions on wearables (e.g., video and audio) to understand user intentions.
ContextAgent then leverages the sensory contexts and the persona contexts from
historical data to predict the necessity for proactive services. When proactive
assistance is needed, ContextAgent further automatically calls the necessary
tools to assist users unobtrusively. To evaluate this new task, we curate
ContextAgentBench, the first benchmark for evaluating context-aware proactive
LLM agents, covering 1,000 samples across nine daily scenarios and twenty

baselines by achieving up to 8.5% and 6.0% higher accuracy in proactive

Abstract: Identifying subtle technical errors within complex scientific and technical
documents, especially those requiring multimodal interpretation (e.g., formulas
in images), presents a significant hurdle for Large Language Models (LLMs)
whose inherent error-correction tendencies can mask inaccuracies. This
exploratory proof-of-concept (PoC) study investigates structured LLM context
conditioning, informed by Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP) principles, as a
methodological strategy to modulate this LLM behavior at inference time. The
approach is designed to enhance the reliability of readily available,
general-purpose LLMs (specifically Gemini 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) for
precise validation tasks, crucially relying only on their standard chat
interfaces without API access or model modifications. To explore this
methodology, we focused on validating chemical formulas within a single,
complex test paper with known textual and image-based errors. Several prompting
strategies were evaluated: while basic prompts proved unreliable, an approach
adapting PWP structures to rigorously condition the LLM's analytical mindset
appeared to improve textual error identification with both models. Notably,
this method also guided Gemini 2.5 Pro to repeatedly identify a subtle
image-based formula error previously overlooked during manual review, a task
where ChatGPT Plus o3 failed in our tests. These preliminary findings highlight
specific LLM operational modes that impede detail-oriented validation and
suggest that PWP-informed context conditioning offers a promising and highly
accessible technique for developing more robust LLM-driven analytical
workflows, particularly for tasks requiring meticulous error detection in
scientific and technical documents. Extensive validation beyond this limited

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的控制和编排方法存在局限性，Pel旨在提供更安全、高效的解决方案。

Method: Pel结合了Lisp、Elixir、Gleam和Haskell的优点，设计了一种语法简单、语义丰富的语言，支持复杂操作、控制流和代理间通信。

Result: Pel提供了强大的功能，如线性组合、闭包支持、自然语言条件评估和自动并行化，显著提升了LLM的编排能力。

Conclusion: Pel为LLM编排提供了更健壮、安全和表达丰富的范式，推动了更复杂可靠的AI代理框架的发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in
computing, yet controlling and orchestrating their capabilities beyond simple
text generation remains a challenge. Current methods, such as function/tool
calling and direct code generation, suffer from limitations in expressiveness,
scalability, cost, security, and the ability to enforce fine-grained control.
This paper introduces Pel, a novel programming language specifically designed
to bridge this gap. Inspired by the strengths of Lisp, Elixir, Gleam, and
Haskell, Pel provides a syntactically simple, homoiconic, and semantically rich
platform for LLMs to express complex actions, control flow, and inter-agent
communication safely and efficiently. Pel's design emphasizes a minimal, easily
modifiable grammar suitable for constrained LLM generation, eliminating the
need for complex sandboxing by enabling capability control at the syntax level.
Key features include a powerful piping mechanism for linear composition,
first-class closures enabling easy partial application and functional patterns,
built-in support for natural language conditions evaluated by LLMs, and an
advanced Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPeL) with Common Lisp-style restarts and
LLM-powered helper agents for automated error correction. Furthermore, Pel
incorporates automatic parallelization of independent operations via static
dependency analysis, crucial for performant agentic systems. We argue that Pel
offers a more robust, secure, and expressive paradigm for LLM orchestration,
paving the way for more sophisticated and reliable AI agentic frameworks.

Conclusion: 分层方法显著提升了LLM在复杂规划任务中的表现，同时构建了高质量的领域模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable planning from natural language
instructions using implicit world knowledge, but often produce flawed plans
that require refinement. Instead of directly predicting plans, recent methods
aim to learn a problem domain that can be solved for different goal states
using classical planners. However, these approaches require significant human
feedback to obtain useful models. We address this shortcoming by learning
hierarchical domains, where low-level predicates and actions are composed into
higher-level counterparts, and by leveraging simulation to validate their
preconditions and effects. This hierarchical approach is particularly powerful
for long-horizon planning, where LLM-based planning approaches typically
struggle. Furthermore, we introduce a central error reasoner to ensure
consistency among the different planning levels. Evaluation on two challenging
International Planning Competition (IPC) domains and a long-horizon robot
manipulation task demonstrates higher planning success rates than
state-of-the-art domain synthesis and LLM-modulo planning methods, while
constructing high-quality models of the domain. Resources, videos and detailed

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in diverse task scenarios.
Nonetheless, existing agentic systems typically rely on predefined agent-role
design spaces and static communication structures, limiting their adaptability
as well as flexibility in complex interaction environments and leading to
subpar performance on highly specialized and expert-level tasks. To address
these issues, we introduce HALO, a multi-agent collaboration framework based on
a hierarchical reasoning architecture. Specifically, we incorporate a
high-level planning agent for task decomposition, mid-level role-design agents
for subtask-specific agent instantiation, and low-level inference agents for
subtask execution. Particularly, subtask execution is reformulated as a
structured workflow search problem, where Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
systematically explores the agentic action space to construct optimal reasoning
trajectories. Additionally, as the majority of users lack expertise in prompt
engineering, we leverage an Adaptive Prompt Refinement module to transform raw
queries into task-specific prompts. Empirical evaluations on Code Generation
(HumanEval), General Reasoning (MMLU), and Arithmetic Reasoning (MATH)
benchmark datasets highlight the effectiveness of HALO, yielding a 14.4%
average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, HALO achieves up
to 13.3% performance gain on the Moral Scenarios subject in the MMLU benchmark
and up to 19.6% performance gain on the Algebra subarea in the MATH benchmark,
indicating its advanced proficiency in tackling highly specialized and
expert-level tasks. The code repository is available at

Result: 生成12,310个基于Schwartz价值理论的问题，对16个LLMs进行基准测试，验证了方法的有效性和区分能力。

Conclusion: AdAEM能动态跟踪LLMs的价值演变，为价值研究提供更丰富的信息。

Abstract: Assessing Large Language Models (LLMs)' underlying value differences enables
comprehensive comparison of their misalignment, cultural adaptability, and
biases. Nevertheless, current value measurement datasets face the
informativeness challenge: with often outdated, contaminated, or generic test
questions, they can only capture the shared value orientations among different
LLMs, leading to saturated and thus uninformative results. To address this
problem, we introduce AdAEM, a novel, self-extensible assessment framework for
revealing LLMs' inclinations. Distinct from previous static benchmarks, AdAEM
can automatically and adaptively generate and extend its test questions. This
is achieved by probing the internal value boundaries of a diverse set of LLMs
developed across cultures and time periods in an in-context optimization
manner. The optimization process theoretically maximizes an
information-theoretic objective to extract the latest or culturally
controversial topics, providing more distinguishable and informative insights
about models' value differences. In this way, AdAEM is able to co-evolve with
the development of LLMs, consistently tracking their value dynamics. Using
AdAEM, we generate 12,310 questions grounded in Schwartz Value Theory, conduct
an extensive analysis to manifest our method's validity and effectiveness, and
benchmark the values of 16 LLMs, laying the groundwork for better value
research.

RAGXplain converts raw scores into coherent narratives identifying performance

Conclusion: knowornot为LLM在RAG中的OOKB鲁棒性评估提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: While the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have progressed
significantly, their use in high-stakes applications have been limited due to
risks of hallucination. One key approach in reducing hallucination is
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), but even in such setups, LLMs may still
hallucinate when presented with questions outside of the knowledge base. Such
behavior is unacceptable in high-stake applications where LLMs are expected to
abstain from answering queries it does not have sufficient context on. In this
work, we present a novel methodology for systematically evaluating
out-of-knowledge base (OOKB) robustness of LLMs (whether LLMs know or do not
know) in the RAG setting, without the need for manual annotation of gold
standard answers. We implement our methodology in knowornot, an open-source
library that enables users to develop their own customized evaluation data and
pipelines for OOKB robustness. knowornot comprises four main features. Firstly,
it provides a unified, high-level API that streamlines the process of setting
up and running robustness benchmarks. Secondly, its modular architecture
emphasizes extensibility and flexibility, allowing users to easily integrate
their own LLM clients and RAG settings. Thirdly, its rigorous data modeling
design ensures experiment reproducibility, reliability and traceability.
Lastly, it implements a comprehensive suite of tools for users to customize
their pipelines. We demonstrate the utility of knowornot by developing a
challenging benchmark, PolicyBench, which spans four Question-Answer (QA)
chatbots on government policies, and analyze its OOKB robustness. The source

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and task planning
capabilities but remain fundamentally limited in physical interaction modeling.
Existing approaches integrate perception via Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or
adaptive decision-making through Reinforcement Learning (RL), but they fail to
capture dynamic object interactions or require task-specific training, limiting
their real-world applicability. We introduce APEX (Anticipatory
Physics-Enhanced Execution), a framework that equips LLMs with physics-driven
foresight for real-time task planning. APEX constructs structured graphs to
identify and model the most relevant dynamic interactions in the environment,
providing LLMs with explicit physical state updates. Simultaneously, APEX
provides low-latency forward simulations of physically feasible actions,
allowing LLMs to select optimal strategies based on predictive outcomes rather
than static observations. We evaluate APEX on three benchmarks designed to
assess perception, prediction, and decision-making: (1) Physics Reasoning
Benchmark, testing causal inference and object motion prediction; (2) Tetris,
evaluating whether physics-informed prediction enhances decision-making
performance in long-horizon planning tasks; (3) Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance,
assessing the immediate integration of perception and action feasibility
analysis. APEX significantly outperforms standard LLMs and VLM-based models,
demonstrating the necessity of explicit physics reasoning for bridging the gap
between language-based intelligence and real-world task execution. The source

Conclusion: 需要结合预定义安全机制和实时语义分解的混合安全策略来增强LLM的安全性。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements,
their security remains a pressing concern. One major threat is jailbreak
attacks, where adversarial prompts bypass model safeguards to generate harmful
or objectionable content. Researchers study jailbreak attacks to understand
security and robustness of LLMs. However, existing jailbreak attack methods
face two main challenges: (1) an excessive number of iterative queries, and (2)
poor generalization across models. In addition, recent jailbreak evaluation
datasets focus primarily on question-answering scenarios, lacking attention to
text generation tasks that require accurate regeneration of toxic content. To
tackle these challenges, we propose two contributions: (1) ICE, a novel
black-box jailbreak method that employs Intent Concealment and divErsion to
effectively circumvent security constraints. ICE achieves high attack success
rates (ASR) with a single query, significantly improving efficiency and
transferability across different models. (2) BiSceneEval, a comprehensive
dataset designed for assessing LLM robustness in question-answering and
text-generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ICE outperforms
existing jailbreak techniques, revealing critical vulnerabilities in current
defense mechanisms. Our findings underscore the necessity of a hybrid security
strategy that integrates predefined security mechanisms with real-time semantic
decomposition to enhance the security of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to protect sensitive
user data. However, current LLM-based privacy solutions assume that these
models can reliably detect personally identifiable information (PII),
particularly named entities. In this paper, we challenge that assumption by
revealing systematic failures in LLM-based privacy tasks. Specifically, we show
that modern LLMs regularly overlook human names even in short text snippets due
to ambiguous contexts, which cause the names to be misinterpreted or
mishandled. We propose AMBENCH, a benchmark dataset of seemingly ambiguous
human names, leveraging the name regularity bias phenomenon, embedded within
concise text snippets along with benign prompt injections. Our experiments on
modern LLMs tasked to detect PII as well as specialized tools show that recall
of ambiguous names drops by 20--40% compared to more recognizable names.
Furthermore, ambiguous human names are four times more likely to be ignored in
supposedly privacy-preserving summaries generated by LLMs when benign prompt
injections are present. These findings highlight the underexplored risks of
relying solely on LLMs to safeguard user privacy and underscore the need for a
more systematic investigation into their privacy failure modes.

produce incorrect answers while showing undue confidence, raising concerns
about their factual reliability. In this work, we identify two pathological
reasoning patterns characterized by overthinking that contribute to the
overconfident and incorrect answers: last-minute guessing and second-thought
spiraling. To address these issues, we propose BARREL-a novel framework that
promotes concise and boundary-aware factual reasoning. Our experiments show
that BARREL-training increases the reliability of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B

Abstract: Reliable causal inference is essential for making decisions in high-stakes
areas like medicine, economics, and public policy. However, it remains unclear
whether large language models (LLMs) can handle rigorous and trustworthy
statistical causal inference. Current benchmarks usually involve simplified
tasks. For example, these tasks might only ask LLMs to identify semantic causal
relationships or draw conclusions directly from raw data. As a result, models
may overlook important statistical pitfalls, such as Simpson's paradox or
selection bias. This oversight limits the applicability of LLMs in the real
world. To address these limitations, we propose CausalPitfalls, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the capability of LLMs in overcoming
common causal inference pitfalls. Our benchmark features structured challenges
across multiple difficulty levels, each paired with grading rubrics. This
approach allows us to quantitatively measure both causal reasoning capabilities
and the reliability of LLMs' responses. We evaluate models using two protocols:
(1) direct prompting, which assesses intrinsic causal reasoning, and (2)
code-assisted prompting, where models generate executable code for explicit
statistical analysis. Additionally, we validate the effectiveness of this judge
by comparing its scoring with assessments from human experts. Our results
reveal significant limitations in current LLMs when performing statistical
causal inference. The CausalPitfalls benchmark provides essential guidance and
quantitative metrics to advance the development of trustworthy causal reasoning
systems.

Abstract: Mathematical modeling is a cornerstone of scientific discovery and
engineering practice, enabling the translation of real-world problems into
formal systems across domains such as physics, biology, and economics. Unlike
mathematical reasoning, which assumes a predefined formulation, modeling
requires open-ended problem analysis, abstraction, and principled
formalization. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning
capabilities, they fall short in rigorous model construction, limiting their
utility in real-world problem-solving. To this end, we formalize the task of
LLM-powered real-world mathematical modeling, where agents must analyze
problems, construct domain-appropriate formulations, and generate complete
end-to-end solutions. We introduce MM-Bench, a curated benchmark of 111
problems from the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM), spanning the
years 2000 to 2025 and across ten diverse domains such as physics, biology, and
economics. To tackle this task, we propose MM-Agent, an expert-inspired
framework that decomposes mathematical modeling into four stages: open-ended
problem analysis, structured model formulation, computational problem solving,
and report generation. Experiments on MM-Bench show that MM-Agent significantly
outperforms baseline agents, achieving an 11.88\% improvement over human expert
solutions while requiring only 15 minutes and \$0.88 per task using GPT-4o.
Furthermore, under official MCM/ICM protocols, MM-Agent assisted two

Abstract: Causal world models are systems that can answer counterfactual questions
about an environment of interest, i.e. predict how it would have evolved if an
arbitrary subset of events had been realized differently. It requires
understanding the underlying causes behind chains of events and conducting
causal inference for arbitrary unseen distributions. So far, this task eludes
foundation models, notably large language models (LLMs), which do not have
demonstrated causal reasoning capabilities beyond the memorization of existing
causal relationships. Furthermore, evaluating counterfactuals in real-world
applications is challenging since only the factual world is observed, limiting
evaluation to synthetic datasets. We address these problems by explicitly
extracting and modeling causal relationships and propose the Causal
Cartographer framework. First, we introduce a graph retrieval-augmented
generation agent tasked to retrieve causal relationships from data. This
approach allows us to construct a large network of real-world causal
relationships that can serve as a repository of causal knowledge and build
real-world counterfactuals. In addition, we create a counterfactual reasoning
agent constrained by causal relationships to perform reliable step-by-step
causal inference. We show that our approach can extract causal knowledge and
improve the robustness of LLMs for causal reasoning tasks while reducing
inference costs and spurious correlations.

Abstract: We introduce SATBench, a benchmark for evaluating the logical reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through logical puzzles derived
from Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. Unlike prior work that focuses on
inference rule-based reasoning, which often involves deducing conclusions from
a set of premises, our approach leverages the search-based nature of SAT
problems, where the objective is to find a solution that fulfills a specified
set of logical constraints. Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT
formula, then translated into a story context and conditions using LLMs. The
generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by
varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both
LLM-assisted and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a
subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini,
achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random
baseline of 50%. SATBench exposes fundamental limitations in the search-based
logical reasoning abilities of current LLMs and provides a scalable testbed for

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于OCR和单一学习算法的表单数据提取方法存在系统改进潜力有限的问题，需要更灵活、自适应的解决方案。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，结合任务特定提示和强化学习策略，通过奖励和惩罚机制指导元提示智能体从错误中学习并改进。

Conclusion: 该框架能够自动化处理多样化文档和布局，减少人工干预，提升信息提取的准确性。

Abstract: Extracting alphanumeric data from form-like documents such as invoices,
purchase orders, bills, and financial documents is often performed via vision
(OCR) and learning algorithms or monolithic pipelines with limited potential
for systemic improvements. We propose an agentic AI system that leverages Large
Language Model (LLM) agents and a reinforcement learning (RL) driver agent to
automate consistent, self-improving extraction under LLM inference uncertainty.
Our work highlights the limitations of monolithic LLM-based extraction and
introduces a modular, multi-agent framework with task-specific prompts and an
RL policy of rewards and penalties to guide a meta-prompting agent to learn
from past errors and improve prompt-based actor agents. This self-corrective
adaptive system handles diverse documents, file formats, layouts, and LLMs,
aiming to automate accurate information extraction without the need for human
intervention. Results as reported on two benchmark datasets of SOIRE, and CORD,
are promising for the agentic AI framework.

TL;DR: NExT-Search proposes a new paradigm to integrate fine-grained feedback into generative AI search, addressing the disconnect in feedback loops by enabling user intervention and AI-assisted feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI search lacks fine-grained feedback for improvement, unlike traditional Web search. This paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Introduces NExT-Search with User Debug Mode and Shadow User Mode, leveraging online adaptation and offline updates for continuous improvement.

Result: A feedback-rich AI search system that evolves with human input, enhancing each stage of the search pipeline.

Conclusion: NExT-Search is a promising direction for continuous improvement in generative AI search through human feedback.

Abstract: Generative AI search is reshaping information retrieval by offering
end-to-end answers to complex queries, reducing users' reliance on manually
browsing and summarizing multiple web pages. However, while this paradigm
enhances convenience, it disrupts the feedback-driven improvement loop that has
historically powered the evolution of traditional Web search. Web search can
continuously improve their ranking models by collecting large-scale,
fine-grained user feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell time) at the document level. In
contrast, generative AI search operates through a much longer search pipeline,
spanning query decomposition, document retrieval, and answer generation, yet
typically receives only coarse-grained feedback on the final answer. This
introduces a feedback loop disconnect, where user feedback for the final output
cannot be effectively mapped back to specific system components, making it
difficult to improve each intermediate stage and sustain the feedback loop. In
this paper, we envision NExT-Search, a next-generation paradigm designed to
reintroduce fine-grained, process-level feedback into generative AI search.
NExT-Search integrates two complementary modes: User Debug Mode, which allows
engaged users to intervene at key stages; and Shadow User Mode, where a
personalized user agent simulates user preferences and provides AI-assisted
feedback for less interactive users. Furthermore, we envision how these
feedback signals can be leveraged through online adaptation, which refines
current search outputs in real-time, and offline update, which aggregates
interaction logs to periodically fine-tune query decomposition, retrieval, and
generation models. By restoring human control over key stages of the generative
AI search pipeline, we believe NExT-Search offers a promising direction for
building feedback-rich AI search systems that can evolve continuously alongside
human feedback.

Method: 通过模拟招聘决策的受控实验，分阶段测试参与者在不同条件下的决策行为。

Result: 参与者70%的时间遵循AI推荐，但很少发现偏见；反事实解释能逆转偏见影响。

Conclusion: 需校准可解释AI以避免行为偏差，确保公平决策。

Abstract: Although the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into everyday tasks
improves efficiency and objectivity, it also risks transmitting bias to human
decision-making. In this study, we conducted a controlled experiment that
simulated hiring decisions to examine how biased AI recommendations - augmented
with or without counterfactual explanations - influence human judgment over
time. Participants, acting as hiring managers, completed 60 decision trials
divided into a baseline phase without AI, followed by a phase with biased (X)AI
recommendations (favoring either male or female candidates), and a final
post-interaction phase without AI. Our results indicate that the participants
followed the AI recommendations 70% of the time when the qualifications of the
given candidates were comparable. Yet, only a fraction of participants detected
the gender bias (8 out of 294). Crucially, exposure to biased AI altered
participants' inherent preferences: in the post-interaction phase,
participants' independent decisions aligned with the bias when no
counterfactual explanations were provided before, but reversed the bias when
explanations were given. Reported trust did not differ significantly across
conditions. Confidence varied throughout the study phases after exposure to
male-biased AI, indicating nuanced effects of AI bias on decision certainty.
Our findings point to the importance of calibrating XAI to avoid unintended
behavioral shifts in order to safeguard equitable decision-making and prevent
the adoption of algorithmic bias.

in attributing institutional responsibility for AI and sustainability

Abstract: The scarcity of data depicting dangerous situations presents a major obstacle
to training AI systems for safety-critical applications, such as construction
safety, where ethical and logistical barriers hinder real-world data
collection. This creates an urgent need for an end-to-end framework to generate
synthetic data that can bridge this gap. While existing methods can produce
synthetic scenes, they often lack the semantic depth required for scene
simulations, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose a novel
multi-agent framework that employs an iterative, in-the-loop collaboration
between two agents: an Evaluator Agent, acting as an LLM-based judge to enforce
semantic consistency and safety-specific constraints, and an Editor Agent,
which generates and refines scenes based on this guidance. Powered by LLM's
capabilities to reasoning and common-sense knowledge, this collaborative design
produces synthetic images tailored to safety-critical scenarios. Our
experiments suggest this design can generate useful scenes based on realistic
specifications that address the shortcomings of prior approaches, balancing
safety requirements with visual semantics. This iterative process holds promise
for delivering robust, aesthetically sound simulations, offering a potential
solution to the data scarcity challenge in multimedia safety applications.

Abstract: Financial tasks are pivotal to global economic stability; however, their
execution faces challenges including labor intensive processes, low error
tolerance, data fragmentation, and tool limitations. Although large language
models (LLMs) have succeeded in various natural language processing tasks and
have shown potential in automating workflows through reasoning and contextual
understanding, current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in finance lack
sufficient domain-specific data, have simplistic task design, and incomplete
evaluation frameworks. To address these gaps, this article presents FinMaster,
a comprehensive financial benchmark designed to systematically assess the
capabilities of LLM in financial literacy, accounting, auditing, and
consulting. Specifically, FinMaster comprises three main modules: i) FinSim,
which builds simulators that generate synthetic, privacy-compliant financial
data for companies to replicate market dynamics; ii) FinSuite, which provides
tasks in core financial domains, spanning 183 tasks of various types and
difficulty levels; and iii) FinEval, which develops a unified interface for
evaluation. Extensive experiments over state-of-the-art LLMs reveal critical
capability gaps in financial reasoning, with accuracy dropping from over 90% on
basic tasks to merely 40% on complex scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning.
This degradation exhibits the propagation of computational errors, where
single-metric calculations initially demonstrating 58% accuracy decreased to
37% in multimetric scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, FinMaster is the
first benchmark that covers full-pipeline financial workflows with challenging
tasks. We hope that FinMaster can bridge the gap between research and industry
practitioners, driving the adoption of LLMs in real-world financial practices
to enhance efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: 结论强调了在稳定条件下保持最小适应性激活的重要性，并提出了抵抗信息压力下刚性的认知架构设计原则。

Abstract: This study explores the emergence of counter-inferential behavior in natural
and artificial cognitive systems, that is, patterns in which agents
misattribute empirical success or suppress adaptation, leading to epistemic
rigidity or maladaptive stability. We analyze archetypal scenarios in which
such behavior arises: reinforcement of stability through reward imbalance,
meta-cognitive attribution of success to internal superiority, and protective
reframing under perceived model fragility. Rather than arising from noise or
flawed design, these behaviors emerge through structured interactions between
internal information models, empirical feedback, and higher-order evaluation
mechanisms. Drawing on evidence from artificial systems, biological cognition,
human psychology, and social dynamics, we identify counter-inferential behavior
as a general cognitive vulnerability that can manifest even in otherwise
well-adapted systems. The findings highlight the importance of preserving
minimal adaptive activation under stable conditions and suggest design
principles for cognitive architectures that can resist rigidity under
informational stress.

Abstract: In the field of AI4Science, large-scale language models (LLMs) show great
potential to parse complex scientific semantics, integrate cross-disciplinary
knowledge, and assist critical task research. However, in the field of drug
discovery, despite the optimization through professional data pre-training,
context window expansion, and internet search, the existing LLMs are still
facing challenges such as massive multi-modal and heterogeneous data
processing, domain knowledge dynamic updating delay, and insufficient
confidence in predicting the results of complex computational tasks. To address
these challenges, we propose the DrugPilot, an LLM-based agent with
parameterized reasoning for drug discovery. DrugPilot addresses key limitations
of traditional end-to-end LLM prediction approaches through its parametric
inference architecture. This agent system supports major phases of the drug
discovery pipeline, facilitating automated planning and execution of
multi-stage research tasks. To address the critical challenge of multi-modal
drug data analysis (incorporating both public datasets and user-submitted
data), we developed an interactive parameterized memory pool. This innovative
component standardizes real-world drug data into parametric representations,
simultaneously enabling efficient knowledge retrieval in multi-turn dialogue
while mitigating the information loss inherent in text-based data transmission.
Additionally, we created a drug instruct dataset across 8 essential drug
discovery tasks for model fine-tuning and evaluation. Based on the Berkeley
function calling evaluation framework, DrugPilot demonstrated the most advanced
tool calling capabilities on our drug discovery tool instruction dataset,
outperforming existing agents (e.g., ReAct, LoT). Specifically, it achieves
task completion rates of 98.0%, 93.5%, and 64.0% on simple, multiple, and
multi-turn tasks, respectively.

Motivation: 随着多模态代理在图形用户界面（GUI）中的使用增加，间接提示注入攻击的威胁日益严重，需要一种动态适应的方法来测试和改进代理的安全性。

Method: EVA通过持续监控代理在GUI上的注意力分布，动态更新对抗性提示（如关键词、措辞和布局），形成一个闭环优化过程。

Result: 在六种广泛使用的GUI代理上测试，EVA显著提高了攻击成功率，并显示出跨模型的攻击模式可转移性。

Conclusion: EVA不仅是一种有效的红队工具，还能揭示多模态代理决策中的共同漏洞。

Abstract: As multimodal agents are increasingly trained to operate graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) to complete user tasks, they face a growing threat from
indirect prompt injection, attacks in which misleading instructions are
embedded into the agent's visual environment, such as popups or chat messages,
and misinterpreted as part of the intended task. A typical example is
environmental injection, in which GUI elements are manipulated to influence
agent behavior without directly modifying the user prompt. To address these
emerging attacks, we propose EVA, a red teaming framework for indirect prompt
injection which transforms the attack into a closed loop optimization by
continuously monitoring an agent's attention distribution over the GUI and
updating adversarial cues, keywords, phrasing, and layout, in response.
Compared with prior one shot methods that generate fixed prompts without regard
for how the model allocates visual attention, EVA dynamically adapts to
emerging attention hotspots, yielding substantially higher attack success rates
and far greater transferability across diverse GUI scenarios. We evaluate EVA
on six widely used generalist and specialist GUI agents in realistic settings
such as popup manipulation, chat based phishing, payments, and email
composition. Experimental results show that EVA substantially improves success
rates over static baselines. Under goal agnostic constraints, where the
attacker does not know the agent's task intent, EVA still discovers effective
patterns. Notably, we find that injection styles transfer well across models,
revealing shared behavioral biases in GUI agents. These results suggest that
evolving indirect prompt injection is a powerful tool not only for red teaming
agents, but also for uncovering common vulnerabilities in their multimodal
decision making.

divides documents into coherent regions covering continuous components. We

Abstract: AI agents have become increasingly adept at complex tasks such as coding,
reasoning, and multimodal understanding. However, building generalist systems
requires moving beyond individual agents to collective inference -- a paradigm
where multi-agent systems with diverse, task-specialized agents complement one
another through structured communication and collaboration. Today, coordination
is usually handled with imprecise, ad-hoc natural language, which limits
complex interaction and hinders interoperability with domain-specific agents.
We introduce Agent context protocols (ACPs): a domain- and agent-agnostic
family of structured protocols for agent-agent communication, coordination, and
error handling. ACPs combine (i) persistent execution blueprints -- explicit
dependency graphs that store intermediate agent outputs -- with (ii)
standardized message schemas, enabling robust and fault-tolerant multi-agent
collective inference. ACP-powered generalist systems reach state-of-the-art
performance: 28.3 % accuracy on AssistantBench for long-horizon web assistance
and best-in-class multimodal technical reports, outperforming commercial AI
systems in human evaluation. ACPs are highly modular and extensible, allowing
practitioners to build top-tier generalist agents quickly.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are widely used in

integration, hindering evaluation in scenarios requiring both textual data and
external information. To address this, we present AMAQA, a new open-access QA
dataset designed to evaluate tasks combining text and metadata. The integration
of metadata is especially important in fields that require rapid analysis of
large volumes of data, such as cybersecurity and intelligence, where timely
access to relevant information is critical. AMAQA includes about 1.1 million
English messages collected from 26 public Telegram groups, enriched with
metadata such as timestamps, topics, emotional tones, and toxicity indicators,
which enable precise and contextualized queries by filtering documents based on
specific criteria. It also includes 450 high-quality QA pairs, making it a
valuable resource for advancing research on metadata-driven QA and RAG systems.
To the best of our knowledge, AMAQA is the first single-hop QA benchmark to
incorporate metadata and labels such as topics covered in the messages. We
conduct extensive tests on the benchmark, establishing a new standard for
future research. We show that leveraging metadata boosts accuracy from 0.12 to
0.61, highlighting the value of structured context. Building on this, we
explore several strategies to refine the LLM input by iterating over provided
context and enriching it with noisy documents, achieving a further 3-point gain
over the best baseline and a 14-point improvement over simple metadata
filtering. The dataset is available at

Abstract: In many real-world applications, deployed models encounter inputs that differ
from the data seen during training. Out-of-distribution detection identifies
whether an input stems from an unseen distribution, while open-world
recognition flags such inputs to ensure the system remains robust as
ever-emerging, previously $unknown$ categories appear and must be addressed
without retraining. Foundation and vision-language models are pre-trained on
large and diverse datasets with the expectation of broad generalization across
domains, including medical imaging. However, benchmarking these models on test
sets with only a few common outlier types silently collapses the evaluation
back to a closed-set problem, masking failures on rare or truly novel
conditions encountered in clinical use.
  We therefore present $NOVA$, a challenging, real-life $evaluation-only$
benchmark of $\sim$900 brain MRI scans that span 281 rare pathologies and

narratives and double-blinded expert bounding-box annotations. Together, these
enable joint assessment of anomaly localisation, visual captioning, and
diagnostic reasoning. Because NOVA is never used for training, it serves as an
$extreme$ stress-test of out-of-distribution generalisation: models must bridge
a distribution gap both in sample appearance and in semantic space. Baseline
results with leading vision-language models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and
Qwen2.5-VL-72B) reveal substantial performance drops across all tasks,
establishing NOVA as a rigorous testbed for advancing models that can detect,
localize, and reason about truly unknown anomalies.

Abstract: Existing AutoML systems have advanced the automation of machine learning
(ML); however, they still require substantial manual configuration and expert
input, particularly when handling multimodal data. We introduce MLZero, a novel
multi-agent framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that enables
end-to-end ML automation across diverse data modalities with minimal human
intervention. A cognitive perception module is first employed, transforming raw
multimodal inputs into perceptual context that effectively guides the
subsequent workflow. To address key limitations of LLMs, such as hallucinated
code generation and outdated API knowledge, we enhance the iterative code
generation process with semantic and episodic memory. MLZero demonstrates
superior performance on MLE-Bench Lite, outperforming all competitors in both
success rate and solution quality, securing six gold medals. Additionally, when
evaluated on our Multimodal AutoML Agent Benchmark, which includes 25 more
challenging tasks spanning diverse data modalities, MLZero outperforms the
competing methods by a large margin with a success rate of 0.92 (+263.6\%) and
an average rank of 2.28. Our approach maintains its robust effectiveness even
with a compact 8B LLM, outperforming full-size systems from existing solutions.

Conclusion: LLaCTR提供了一种高效且有效的LLM增强CTR预测方法。

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a fundamental task in modern
recommender systems. In recent years, the integration of large language models
(LLMs) has been shown to effectively enhance the performance of traditional CTR
methods. However, existing LLM-enhanced methods often require extensive
processing of detailed textual descriptions for large-scale instances or
user/item entities, leading to substantial computational overhead. To address
this challenge, this work introduces LLaCTR, a novel and lightweight
LLM-enhanced CTR method that employs a field-level enhancement paradigm.
Specifically, LLaCTR first utilizes LLMs to distill crucial and lightweight
semantic knowledge from small-scale feature fields through self-supervised
field-feature fine-tuning. Subsequently, it leverages this field-level semantic
knowledge to enhance both feature representation and feature interactions. In
our experiments, we integrate LLaCTR with six representative CTR models across
four datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in terms of both
effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing LLM-enhanced methods. Our

Result: 实验表明，AudioJailbreak在多种LALMs上表现出高有效性，且适用于更广泛的攻击场景。

Conclusion: AudioJailbreak揭示了LALMs的安全隐患，并为其安全鲁棒性改进提供了实际参考。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks to Large audio-language models (LALMs) are studied
recently, but they achieve suboptimal effectiveness, applicability, and
practicability, particularly, assuming that the adversary can fully manipulate
user prompts. In this work, we first conduct an extensive experiment showing
that advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end
LALMs via text-to speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AudioJailbreak, a
novel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audio
does not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal
jailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is
effective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into
perturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak
audios will not raise the awareness of victims by proposing various intent
concealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios
remain effective when being played over the air by incorporating the
reverberation distortion effect with room impulse response into the generation
of the perturbations. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot
offer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, or over-the-air robustness.
Moreover, AudioJailbreak is also applicable to the adversary who cannot fully
manipulate user prompts, thus has a much broader attack scenario. Extensive
experiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of
AudioJailbreak. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications
of audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving
their security robustness. The implementation and audio samples are available
at our website https://audiojailbreak.github.io/AudioJailbreak.

Conclusion: Abacus显著提升了语义操作符系统的性能，尤其在多约束优化场景中表现突出。

Abstract: LLMs enable an exciting new class of data processing applications over large
collections of unstructured documents. Several new programming frameworks have
enabled developers to build these applications by composing them out of
semantic operators: a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with
natural language specifications. These include LLM-powered maps, filters,
joins, etc. used for document processing tasks such as information extraction,
summarization, and more. While systems of semantic operators have achieved
strong performance on benchmarks, they can be difficult to optimize. An
optimizer for this setting must determine how to physically implement each
semantic operator in a way that optimizes the system globally. Existing
optimizers are limited in the number of optimizations they can apply, and most
(if not all) cannot optimize system quality, cost, or latency subject to
constraint(s) on the other dimensions. In this paper we present Abacus, an
extensible, cost-based optimizer which searches for the best implementation of
a semantic operator system given a (possibly constrained) optimization
objective. Abacus estimates operator performance by leveraging a minimal set of
validation examples and, if available, prior beliefs about operator
performance. We evaluate Abacus on document processing workloads in the
biomedical and legal domains (BioDEX; CUAD) and multi-modal question answering
(MMQA). We demonstrate that systems optimized by Abacus achieve 18.7%-39.2%
better quality and up to 23.6x lower cost and 4.2x lower latency than the next
best system.

heuristics that can generalize across problem instances. However, integrating
external knowledge that will steer combinatorial optimization problem solutions

this paper, we propose the first RL solution that uses constrained action
spaces to guide the normalized cut problem towards pre-defined template
instances. Using transportation networks as an example domain, we create a
Wedge and Ring Transformer that results in graph partitions that are shaped in
form of Wedges and Rings and which are likely to be closer to natural optimal
partitions. However, our approach is general as it is based on principles that
can be generalized to other domains.

Conclusion: ProMind-LLM offers a more dependable, interpretable, and scalable solution for mental health risk assessment.

Abstract: Mental health risk is a critical global public health challenge,
necessitating innovative and reliable assessment methods. With the development
of large language models (LLMs), they stand out to be a promising tool for
explainable mental health care applications. Nevertheless, existing approaches
predominantly rely on subjective textual mental records, which can be distorted

predictions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces ProMind-LLM.
We investigate an innovative approach integrating objective behavior data as
complementary information alongside subjective mental records for robust mental
health risk assessment. Specifically, ProMind-LLM incorporates a comprehensive
pipeline that includes domain-specific pretraining to tailor the LLM for mental
health contexts, a self-refine mechanism to optimize the processing of
numerical behavioral data, and causal chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance the
reliability and interpretability of its predictions. Evaluations of two

proposed methods, achieving substantial improvements over general LLMs. We
anticipate that ProMind-LLM will pave the way for more dependable,
interpretable, and scalable mental health case solutions.

Conclusion: NeuralLTO框架有效解决了多维连续域泛化问题，为复杂数据分布下的模型泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Real-world data distributions often shift continuously across multiple latent
factors such as time, geography, and socioeconomic context. However, existing
domain generalization approaches typically treat domains as discrete or
evolving along a single axis (e.g., time), which fails to capture the complex,
multi-dimensional nature of real-world variation. This paper introduces the
task of Continuous Domain Generalization (CDG), which aims to generalize
predictive models to unseen domains defined by arbitrary combinations of
continuous variation descriptors. We present a principled framework grounded in
geometric and algebraic theory, showing that optimal model parameters across
domains lie on a low-dimensional manifold. To model this structure, we propose
a Neural Lie Transport Operator (NeuralLTO), which enables structured parameter
transitions by enforcing geometric continuity and algebraic consistency. To
handle noisy or incomplete domain descriptors, we introduce a gating mechanism
to suppress irrelevant dimensions and a local chart-based strategy for robust
generalization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets-including remote sensing, scientific documents, and traffic
forecasting-demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
baselines in generalization accuracy and robustness under descriptor
imperfections.

Abstract: Textbook question answering (TQA) is a complex task, requiring the
interpretation of complex multimodal context. Although recent advances have
improved overall performance, they often encounter difficulties in educational
settings where accurate semantic alignment and task-specific document retrieval
are essential. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to multimodal
textbook question answering by introducing a mechanism for enhancing semantic
representations through multi-objective joint training. Our model, Joint
Embedding Training With Ranking Supervision for Textbook Question Answering
(JETRTQA), is a multimodal learning framework built on a retriever--generator
architecture that uses a retrieval-augmented generation setup, in which a
multimodal large language model generates answers. JETRTQA is designed to
improve the relevance of retrieved documents in complex educational contexts.
Unlike traditional direct scoring approaches, JETRTQA learns to refine the
semantic representations of questions and documents through a supervised signal
that combines pairwise ranking and implicit supervision derived from answers.
We evaluate our method on the CK12-QA dataset and demonstrate that it
significantly improves the discrimination between informative and irrelevant
documents, even when they are long, complex, and multimodal. JETRTQA
outperforms the previous state of the art, achieving a 2.4\% gain in accuracy
on the validation set and 11.1\% on the test set.

Abstract: Information extraction (IE) from Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) containing
layout features along with text is a critical and well-studied task.
Specialized non-LLM NLP-based solutions typically involve training models using
both textual and geometric information to label sequences/tokens as named
entities or answers to specific questions. However, these approaches lack
reasoning, are not able to infer values not explicitly present in documents,
and do not generalize well to new formats. Generative LLM-based approaches
proposed recently are capable of reasoning, but struggle to comprehend clues
from document layout especially in previously unseen document formats, and do
not show competitive performance in heterogeneous VRD benchmark datasets. In
this paper, we propose BLOCKIE, a novel LLM-based approach that organizes VRDs
into localized, reusable semantic textual segments called $\textit{semantic
blocks}$, which are processed independently. Through focused and more
generalizable reasoning,our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on public
VRD benchmarks by 1-3% in F1 scores, is resilient to document formats

Abstract: Just-in-time Information Recommendation (JIR) is a service designed to

decision-making and efficiency in daily life. Advances in device-efficient
deployment of foundation models and the growing use of intelligent wearable
devices have made always-on JIR assistants feasible. However, there has been no
systematic effort to formally define JIR tasks or establish evaluation
frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present the first mathematical definition of
JIR tasks and associated evaluation metrics. Additionally, we introduce
JIR-Arena, a multimodal benchmark dataset featuring diverse,
information-request-intensive scenarios to evaluate JIR systems across critical
dimensions: i) accurately inferring user information needs, ii) delivering
timely and relevant recommendations, and iii) avoiding irrelevant content that
may distract users.
  Developing a JIR benchmark dataset poses challenges due to subjectivity in
estimating user information needs and uncontrollable system variables affecting
reproducibility. To address these, JIR-Arena: i) combines input from multiple
humans and large AI models to approximate information need distributions; ii)
assesses JIR quality through information retrieval outcomes using static
knowledge base snapshots; and iii) employs a multi-turn, multi-entity
validation framework to improve objectivity and generality. Furthermore, we
implement a baseline JIR system capable of processing real-time information
streams aligned with user inputs. Our evaluation of this baseline system on
JIR-Arena indicates that while foundation model-based JIR systems simulate user
needs with reasonable precision, they face challenges in recall and effective
content retrieval. To support future research in this new area, we fully
release our code and data.

comprehensive understanding of learners' knowledge states. In this paper, we
propose TransKT, a contrastive cross-course knowledge tracing method that
leverages concept graph guided knowledge transfer to model the relationships
between learning behaviors across different courses, thereby enhancing
knowledge state estimation. Specifically, TransKT constructs a cross-course
concept graph by leveraging zero-shot Large Language Model (LLM) prompts to
establish implicit links between related concepts across different courses.
This graph serves as the foundation for knowledge transfer, enabling the model
to integrate and enhance the semantic features of learners' interactions across
courses. Furthermore, TransKT includes an LLM-to-LM pipeline for incorporating
summarized semantic features, which significantly improves the performance of
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) used for knowledge transfer. Additionally,
TransKT employs a contrastive objective that aligns single-course and
cross-course knowledge states, thereby refining the model's ability to provide
a more robust and accurate representation of learners' overall knowledge
states.

TL;DR: ADALog是一个基于Transformer的自适应无监督异常检测框架，用于处理异构日志数据，无需依赖日志解析或标记数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件系统生成大量异构日志数据，传统方法依赖日志解析或标记数据，难以适应动态格式和碎片化事件序列。

Method: 使用预训练的双向编码器（基于Transformer）和掩码语言建模任务，提取日志上下文关系，并通过自适应阈值检测异常。

Result: 在BGL、Thunderbird和Spirit数据集上表现优异，优于现有监督和无监督方法。

Conclusion: ADALog能动态适应系统行为变化，避免传统方法的刚性阈值，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern software systems generate extensive heterogeneous log data with
dynamic formats, fragmented event sequences, and varying temporal patterns,
making anomaly detection both crucial and challenging. To address these
complexities, we propose ADALog, an adaptive, unsupervised anomaly detection
framework designed for practical applicability across diverse real-world
environments. Unlike traditional methods reliant on log parsing, strict
sequence dependencies, or labeled data, ADALog operates on individual
unstructured logs, extracts intra-log contextual relationships, and performs
adaptive thresholding on normal data. The proposed approach utilizes a
transformer-based, pretrained bidirectional encoder with a masked language
modeling task, fine-tuned on normal logs to capture domain-specific syntactic
and semantic patterns essential for accurate anomaly detection. Anomalies are
identified via token-level reconstruction probabilities, aggregated into
log-level scores, with adaptive percentile-based thresholding calibrated only
on normal data. This allows the model to dynamically adapt to evolving system
behaviors while avoiding rigid, heuristic-based thresholds common in
traditional systems. We evaluate ADALog on benchmark datasets BGL, Thunderbird,
and Spirit, showing strong generalization and competitive performance compared
to state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Additional ablation
studies examine the effects of masking, fine-tuning, and token positioning on
model behavior and interpretability.

Method: 采用基于Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs)的结构化推理方法，结合专用智能体和法官智能体，并使用多样化的few-shot示例增强多样性。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理模糊查询，适合生产环境部署，并展现出跨领域和语言的强泛化能力。

Abstract: Modern applications require accurate and efficient retrieval of information
in response to user queries. Mapping user utterances to the most relevant
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) is a crucial component of these systems.
Traditional approaches often rely on a single model or technique, which may not
capture the nuances of diverse user inquiries. In this paper, we introduce a
multi-agent framework for FAQ annotation that combines multiple specialized
agents with different approaches and a judge agent that reranks candidates to
produce optimal results. Our agents utilize a structured reasoning approach
inspired by Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs), which guides them through
systematic reasoning steps using targeted, task-specific JSON queries. Our
framework features a specialized few-shot example strategy, where each agent
receives different few-shots, enhancing ensemble diversity and coverage of the
query space. We evaluate our framework on a real-world banking dataset as well
as public benchmark datasets (LCQMC and FiQA), demonstrating significant
improvements over single-agent approaches across multiple metrics, including a
14% increase in Top-1 accuracy, an 18% increase in Top-5 accuracy, and a 12%
improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank on our dataset, and similar gains on public
benchmarks when compared with traditional single agent annotation techniques.
Our framework is particularly effective at handling ambiguous queries, making
it well-suited for deployment in production applications while showing strong
generalization capabilities across different domains and languages.

Result: ESWM表现出高效性和适应性，仅需少量观察即可构建稳健的环境表示，并能快速适应环境变化。

Conclusion: ESWM为从稀疏记忆中构建空间模型提供了有效方法，支持探索和导航任务。

Abstract: Many animals possess a remarkable capacity to rapidly construct flexible
mental models of their environments. These world models are crucial for
ethologically relevant behaviors such as navigation, exploration, and planning.
The ability to form episodic memories and make inferences based on these sparse
experiences is believed to underpin the efficiency and adaptability of these
models in the brain. Here, we ask: Can a neural network learn to construct a
spatial model of its surroundings from sparse and disjoint episodic memories?
We formulate the problem in a simulated world and propose a novel framework,
the Episodic Spatial World Model (ESWM), as a potential answer. We show that
ESWM is highly sample-efficient, requiring minimal observations to construct a
robust representation of the environment. It is also inherently adaptive,
allowing for rapid updates when the environment changes. In addition, we
demonstrate that ESWM readily enables near-optimal strategies for exploring
novel environments and navigating between arbitrary points, all without the
need for additional training.

Abstract: We compare three methods of familiarizing a human with an artificial
intelligence (AI) teammate ("agent") prior to operation in a collaborative,
fast-paced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) environment. In
a between-subjects user study (n=60), participants either read documentation
about the agent, trained alongside the agent prior to the mission, or were
given no familiarization. Results showed that the most valuable information
about the agent included details of its decision-making algorithms and its
relative strengths and weaknesses compared to the human. This information
allowed the familiarization groups to form sophisticated team strategies more
quickly than the control group. Documentation-based familiarization led to the
fastest adoption of these strategies, but also biased participants towards
risk-averse behavior that prevented high scores. Participants familiarized
through direct interaction were able to infer much of the same information
through observation, and were more willing to take risks and experiment with
different control modes, but reported weaker understanding of the agent's
internal processes. Significant differences were seen between individual
participants' risk tolerance and methods of AI interaction, which should be
considered when designing human-AI control interfaces. Based on our findings,
we recommend a human-AI team familiarization method that combines AI
documentation, structured in-situ training, and exploratory interaction.

Abstract: Evaluating ecological time series is critical for benchmarking model
performance in many important applications, including predicting greenhouse gas
fluxes, capturing carbon-nitrogen dynamics, and monitoring hydrological cycles.
Traditional numerical metrics (e.g., R-squared, root mean square error) have
been widely used to quantify the similarity between modeled and observed
ecosystem variables, but they often fail to capture domain-specific temporal
patterns critical to ecological processes. As a result, these methods are often
accompanied by expert visual inspection, which requires substantial human labor
and limits the applicability to large-scale evaluation. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates metric learning with
large language model (LLM)-based natural language policy extraction to develop
interpretable evaluation criteria. The proposed method processes pairwise
annotations and implements a policy optimization mechanism to generate and
combine different assessment metrics. The results obtained on multiple datasets
for evaluating the predictions of crop gross primary production and carbon
dioxide flux have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method in
capturing target assessment preferences, including both synthetically generated
and expert-annotated model comparisons. The proposed framework bridges the gap
between numerical metrics and expert knowledge while providing interpretable
evaluation policies that accommodate the diverse needs of different ecosystem
modeling studies.

Conclusion: 通过整合自主视频搜索、实时交互和内容生成三大核心能力，推动视频理解从被动感知向智能代理的转变。

Abstract: Modern video understanding systems excel at tasks such as scene
classification, object detection, and short video retrieval. However, as video
analysis becomes increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a
growing need for proactive video agents for the systems that not only interpret
video streams but also reason about events and take informed actions. A key
obstacle in this direction is temporal reasoning: while deep learning models
have made remarkable progress in recognizing patterns within individual frames
or short clips, they struggle to understand the sequencing and dependencies of
events over time, which is critical for action-driven decision-making.
Addressing this limitation demands moving beyond conventional deep learning
approaches. We posit that tackling this challenge requires a neuro-symbolic
perspective, where video queries are decomposed into atomic events, structured
into coherent sequences, and validated against temporal constraints. Such an
approach can enhance interpretability, enable structured reasoning, and provide
stronger guarantees on system behavior, all key properties for advancing
trustworthy video agents. To this end, we present a grand challenge to the
research community: developing the next generation of intelligent video agents
that integrate three core capabilities: (1) autonomous video search and
analysis, (2) seamless real-world interaction, and (3) advanced content
generation. By addressing these pillars, we can transition from passive
perception to intelligent video agents that reason, predict, and act, pushing
the boundaries of video understanding.

Abstract: Despite advances in deep learning for education, student knowledge tracing

inadequate modeling of diverse learning activities (especially non-assessed
materials), and overlooking the interplay between knowledge acquisition and
behavioral patterns. Practical limitations, such as fixed-size sequence
segmentation, frequently lead to the loss of contextual information vital for
personalized learning. Moreover, reliance on student performance on assessed
materials limits the modeling scope, excluding non-assessed interactions like
lectures. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose Knowledge Modeling and
Material Prediction (KMaP), a stateful multi-task approach designed for
personalized and simultaneous modeling of student knowledge and behavior. KMaP
employs clustering-based student profiling to create personalized student
representations, improving predictions of future learning resource preferences.
Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets confirm significant behavioral
differences across student clusters and validate the efficacy of the KMaP

Conclusion: SPlanner通过规划模块显著提升了移动GUI代理的任务执行能力。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents execute user commands by directly interacting with the
graphical user interface (GUI) of mobile devices, demonstrating significant
potential to enhance user convenience. However, these agents face considerable
challenges in task planning, as they must continuously analyze the GUI and
generate operation instructions step by step. This process often leads to
difficulties in making accurate task plans, as GUI agents lack a deep
understanding of how to effectively use the target applications, which can
cause them to become "lost" during task execution. To address the task planning
issue, we propose SPlanner, a plug-and-play planning module to generate
execution plans that guide vision language model(VLMs) in executing tasks. The
proposed planning module utilizes extended finite state machines (EFSMs) to
model the control logits and configurations of mobile applications. It then
decomposes a user instruction into a sequence of primary function modeled in
EFSMs, and generate the execution path by traversing the EFSMs. We further
refine the execution path into a natural language plan using an LLM. The final
plan is concise and actionable, and effectively guides VLMs to generate
interactive GUI actions to accomplish user tasks. SPlanner demonstrates strong
performance on dynamic benchmarks reflecting real-world mobile usage. On the
AndroidWorld benchmark, SPlanner achieves a 63.8% task success rate when paired
with Qwen2.5-VL-72B as the VLM executor, yielding a 28.8 percentage point
improvement compared to using Qwen2.5-VL-72B without planning assistance.

to distinctly model common and unique task characteristics, thereby avoiding
parameter conflicts. Additionally, inspired by low-rank structures in the
Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, we design low-rank expert networks to
reduce parameter and computational overhead as the number of experts increases.
Extensive experiments on the CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI benchmarks demonstrate that
MMoLRE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MSA task and competitive

Abstract: In this work, we present the first general logic of attention. Attention is a
powerful cognitive ability that allows agents to focus on potentially complex
information, such as logically structured propositions, higher-order beliefs,
or what other agents pay attention to. This ability is a strength, as it helps
to ignore what is irrelevant, but it can also introduce biases when some types
of information or agents are systematically ignored. Existing dynamic epistemic
logics for attention cannot model such complex attention scenarios, as they
only model attention to atomic formulas. Additionally, such logics quickly
become cumbersome, as their size grows exponentially in the number of agents
and announced literals. Here, we introduce a logic that overcomes both
limitations. First, we generalize edge-conditioned event models, which we show
to be as expressive as standard event models yet exponentially more succinct
(generalizing both standard event models and generalized arrow updates).
Second, we extend attention to arbitrary formulas, allowing agents to also
attend to other agents' beliefs or attention. Our work treats attention as a
modality, like belief or awareness. We introduce attention principles that
impose closure properties on that modality and that can be used in its
axiomatization. Throughout, we illustrate our framework with examples of AI
agents reasoning about human attentional biases, demonstrating how such agents
can discover attentional biases.

Abstract: As financial institutions increasingly rely on machine learning models to

This paper explores the tradeoff between enforcing fairness constraints (such
as demographic parity or equal opportunity) and maximizing lender
profitability. Through simulations on synthetic data that reflects real-world
lending patterns, we quantify how different fairness interventions impact
profit margins and default rates. Our results demonstrate that equal
opportunity constraints typically impose lower profit costs than demographic
parity, but surprisingly, removing protected attributes from the model
(fairness through unawareness) outperforms explicit fairness interventions in
both fairness and profitability metrics. We further identify the specific
economic conditions under which fair lending becomes profitable and analyze the
feature-specific drivers of unfairness. These findings offer practical guidance
for designing lending algorithms that balance ethical considerations with
business objectives.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, the proliferation of
autonomous agents has introduced new challenges in interoperability,
scalability, and coordination. The Internet of Agents (IoA) aims to
interconnect heterogeneous agents through standardized communication protocols,
enabling seamless collaboration and intelligent task execution. However,
existing agent communication protocols such as MCP, A2A, and ANP remain
fragmented and scenario-specific. To address this gap, we propose Agent
Collaboration Protocols (ACPs), a comprehensive protocol suite for the IoA.
ACPs include registration, discovery, interaction, and tooling protocols to
support trustable access, capability orchestration, and workflow construction.
We present the architecture, key technologies, and application workflows of
ACPs, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a collaborative restaurant booking
scenario. ACPs lay the foundation for building a secure, open, and scalable
agent internet infrastructure.

TL;DR: 论文提出GA-LLM框架，通过地理坐标注入模块和POI对齐模块增强LLM在空间任务中的表现，解决了LLM在POI推荐中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在语义理解和上下文推理方面表现优异，但在空间任务（如下一个POI推荐）中面临地理坐标建模和POI关系捕获的挑战。

Method: GA-LLM框架包含两个模块：1) 地理坐标注入模块（GCIM），通过分层和傅里叶位置编码将GPS坐标转化为空间表示；2) POI对齐模块（PAM），将POI转移关系融入LLM的语义空间。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，GA-LLM达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GA-LLM通过增强LLM的地理感知能力，成功解决了空间任务中的挑战，为POI推荐提供了新思路。

Abstract: The next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict users'
next destinations based on their historical movement data and plays a key role
in location-based services and personalized applications. Accurate next POI
recommendation depends on effectively modeling geographic information and POI
transition relations, which are crucial for capturing spatial dependencies and
user movement patterns. While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong
capabilities in semantic understanding and contextual reasoning, applying them
to spatial tasks like next POI recommendation remains challenging. First, the
infrequent nature of specific GPS coordinates makes it difficult for LLMs to
model precise spatial contexts. Second, the lack of knowledge about POI
transitions limits their ability to capture potential POI-POI relationships. To
address these issues, we propose GA-LLM (Geography-Aware Large Language Model),
a novel framework that enhances LLMs with two specialized components. The
Geographic Coordinate Injection Module (GCIM) transforms GPS coordinates into
spatial representations using hierarchical and Fourier-based positional
encoding, enabling the model to understand geographic features from multiple
perspectives. The POI Alignment Module (PAM) incorporates POI transition
relations into the LLM's semantic space, allowing it to infer global POI
relationships and generalize to unseen POIs. Experiments on three real-world
datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of GA-LLM.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的代理带来新型威胁，凸显现代推荐系统需加强防御。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are increasingly vulnerable to shilling attacks,
where adversaries inject fake user profiles to manipulate system outputs.
Traditional attack strategies often rely on simplistic heuristics, require
access to internal RS data, and overlook the manipulation potential of textual
reviews. In this work, we introduce Agent4SR, a novel framework that leverages
Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to perform low-knowledge, high-impact
shilling attacks through both rating and review generation. Agent4SR simulates
realistic user behavior by orchestrating adversarial interactions, selecting
items, assigning ratings, and crafting reviews, while maintaining behavioral
plausibility. Our design includes targeted profile construction, hybrid memory
retrieval, and a review attack strategy that propagates target item features
across unrelated reviews to amplify manipulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets and RS architectures demonstrate that Agent4SR outperforms
existing low-knowledge baselines in both effectiveness and stealth. Our
findings reveal a new class of emergent threats posed by LLM-driven agents,
underscoring the urgent need for enhanced defenses in modern recommender
systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), known for its self-evolution capability, offers
a promising approach to training high-level autonomous driving systems.
However, handling constraints remains a significant challenge for existing RL
algorithms, particularly in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose
a new safety-oriented training technique called harmonic policy iteration
(HPI). At each RL iteration, it first calculates two policy gradients
associated with efficient driving and safety constraints, respectively. Then, a
harmonic gradient is derived for policy updating, minimizing conflicts between
the two gradients and consequently enabling a more balanced and stable training
process. Furthermore, we adopt the state-of-the-art DSAC algorithm as the
backbone and integrate it with our HPI to develop a new safe RL algorithm,
DSAC-H. Extensive simulations in multi-lane scenarios demonstrate that DSAC-H
achieves efficient driving performance with near-zero safety constraint
violations.

Abstract: Learning in games is a fundamental problem in machine learning and artificial
intelligence, with numerous
applications~\citep{silver2016mastering,schrittwieser2020mastering}. This work
investigates two-player zero-sum matrix games with an unknown payoff matrix and
bandit feedback, where each player observes their actions and the corresponding
noisy payoff. Prior studies have proposed algorithms for this
setting~\citep{o2021matrix,maiti2023query,cai2024uncoupled}, with
\citet{o2021matrix} demonstrating the effectiveness of deterministic optimism
(e.g., \ucb) in achieving sublinear regret. However, the potential of
randomised optimism in matrix games remains theoretically unexplored.
  We propose Competitive Co-evolutionary Bandit Learning (\coebl), a novel
algorithm that integrates evolutionary algorithms (EAs) into the bandit
framework to implement randomised optimism through EA variation operators. We
prove that \coebl achieves sublinear regret, matching the performance of
deterministic optimism-based methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first theoretical regret analysis of an evolutionary bandit learning algorithm
in matrix games.
  Empirical evaluations on diverse matrix game benchmarks demonstrate that
\coebl not only achieves sublinear regret but also consistently outperforms
classical bandit algorithms, including \exptr~\citep{auer2002nonstochastic},
the variant \exptrni~\citep{cai2024uncoupled}, and \ucb~\citep{o2021matrix}.
These results highlight the potential of evolutionary bandit learning,
particularly the efficacy of randomised optimism via evolutionary algorithms in
game-theoretic settings.

Result: 提供了一个完整的流程，支持为任何知识图谱生成参考查询集。

Conclusion: Q²Forge是一个通用、可扩展的工具，能够显著提升知识图谱查询的可用性和质量。

Abstract: The SPARQL query language is the standard method to access knowledge graphs
(KGs). However, formulating SPARQL queries is a significant challenge for
non-expert users, and remains time-consuming for the experienced ones. Best
practices recommend to document KGs with competency questions and example
queries to contextualise the knowledge they contain and illustrate their
potential applications. In practice, however, this is either not the case or
the examples are provided in limited numbers. Large Language Models (LLMs) are
being used in conversational agents and are proving to be an attractive
solution with a wide range of applications, from simple question-answering
about common knowledge to generating code in a targeted programming language.
However, training and testing these models to produce high quality SPARQL
queries from natural language questions requires substantial datasets of
question-query pairs. In this paper, we present Q${}^2$Forge that addresses the
challenge of generating new competency questions for a KG and corresponding
SPARQL queries. It iteratively validates those queries with human feedback and
LLM as a judge. Q${}^2$Forge is open source, generic, extensible and modular,
meaning that the different modules of the application (CQ generation, query
generation and query refinement) can be used separately, as an integrated
pipeline, or replaced by alternative services. The result is a complete
pipeline from competency question formulation to query evaluation, supporting
the creation of reference query sets for any target KG.

Abstract: The next-coordinate prediction paradigm has emerged as the de facto standard
in current auto-regressive mesh generation methods. Despite their
effectiveness, there is no efficient measurement for the various tokenizers
that serialize meshes into sequences. In this paper, we introduce a new metric
Per-Token-Mesh-Entropy (PTME) to evaluate the existing mesh tokenizers
theoretically without any training. Building upon PTME, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenization technique called coordinate merging. It further
improves the compression ratios of existing tokenizers by rearranging and
merging the most frequent patterns of coordinates. Through experiments on
various tokenization methods like MeshXL, MeshAnything V2, and Edgerunner, we
further validate the performance of our method. We hope that the proposed PTME
and coordinate merging can enhance the existing mesh tokenizers and guide the
further development of native mesh generation.

Abstract: Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is critical for delivering reliable, secure,
and efficient software products. The Software Quality Assurance Process aims to
provide assurance that work products and processes comply with predefined
provisions and plans. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs)
present new opportunities to enhance existing SQA processes by automating tasks
like requirement analysis, code review, test generation, and compliance checks.
Simultaneously, established standards such as ISO/IEC 12207, ISO/IEC 25010,
ISO/IEC 5055, ISO 9001/ISO/IEC 90003, CMMI, and TMM provide structured
frameworks for ensuring robust quality practices. This paper surveys the
intersection of LLM-based SQA methods and these recognized standards,
highlighting how AI-driven solutions can augment traditional approaches while
maintaining compliance and process maturity. We first review the foundational
software quality standards and the technical fundamentals of LLMs in software
engineering. Next, we explore various LLM-based SQA applications, including
requirement validation, defect detection, test generation, and documentation
maintenance. We then map these applications to key software quality frameworks,
illustrating how LLMs can address specific requirements and metrics within each
standard. Empirical case studies and open-source initiatives demonstrate the
practical viability of these methods. At the same time, discussions on
challenges (e.g., data privacy, model bias, explainability) underscore the need
for deliberate governance and auditing. Finally, we propose future directions
encompassing adaptive learning, privacy-focused deployments, multimodal
analysis, and evolving standards for AI-driven software quality.

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are widely used for solving complex optimization
problems, yet their effectiveness is often constrained by fixed structures and
the need for extensive tuning. The Polymorphic Metaheuristic Framework (PMF)
addresses this limitation by introducing a self-adaptive metaheuristic
switching mechanism driven by real-time performance feedback and dynamic
algorithmic selection. PMF leverages the Polymorphic Metaheuristic Agent (PMA)
and the Polymorphic Metaheuristic Selection Agent (PMSA) to dynamically select
and transition between metaheuristic algorithms based on key performance
indicators, ensuring continuous adaptation. This approach enhances convergence
speed, adaptability, and solution quality, outperforming traditional
metaheuristics in high-dimensional, dynamic, and multimodal environments.
Experimental results on benchmark functions demonstrate that PMF significantly
improves optimization efficiency by mitigating stagnation and balancing
exploration-exploitation strategies across various problem landscapes. By
integrating AI-driven decision-making and self-correcting mechanisms, PMF paves
the way for scalable, intelligent, and autonomous optimization frameworks, with
promising applications in engineering, logistics, and complex decision-making
systems.

navigation policies via Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs). By assigning
acceptable uncertainty levels to different locations, TSUMs enable robots to

learning, GUIDE learns policies that balance task completion and uncertainty
management without extensive reward engineering. Real-world tests show
significant performance gains over methods lacking task-specific uncertainty

Abstract: Autonomous robots must navigate and operate in diverse environments, from
terrestrial and aquatic settings to aerial and space domains. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in training policies for specific
autonomous robots, existing benchmarks are often constrained to unique
platforms, limiting generalization and fair comparisons across different
mobility systems. In this paper, we present NavBench, a multi-domain benchmark
for training and evaluating RL-based navigation policies across diverse robotic
platforms and operational environments. Built on IsaacLab, our framework
standardizes task definitions, enabling different robots to tackle various
navigation challenges without the need for ad-hoc task redesigns or custom
evaluation metrics. Our benchmark addresses three key challenges: (1) Unified
cross-medium benchmarking, enabling direct evaluation of diverse actuation
methods (thrusters, wheels, water-based propulsion) in realistic environments;
(2) Scalable and modular design, facilitating seamless robot-task
interchangeability and reproducible training pipelines; and (3) Robust
sim-to-real validation, demonstrated through successful policy transfer to
multiple real-world robots, including a satellite robotic simulator, an
unmanned surface vessel, and a wheeled ground vehicle. By ensuring consistency
between simulation and real-world deployment, NavBench simplifies the
development of adaptable RL-based navigation strategies. Its modular design
allows researchers to easily integrate custom robots and tasks by following the
framework's predefined templates, making it accessible for a wide range of
applications. Our code is publicly available at NavBench.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has led to considerable progress in Speaker
Verification (SV). The standard framework uses same-utterance positive sampling
and data-augmentation to generate anchor-positive pairs of the same speaker.
This is a major limitation, as this strategy primarily encodes channel
information from the recording condition, shared by the anchor and positive. We
propose a new positive sampling technique to address this bottleneck:
Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS). For a given anchor, SSPS aims to find
an appropriate positive, i.e., of the same speaker identity but a different
recording condition, in the latent space using clustering assignments and a
memory queue of positive embeddings. SSPS improves SV performance for both
SimCLR and DINO, reaching 2.57% and 2.53% EER, outperforming SOTA SSL methods
on VoxCeleb1-O. In particular, SimCLR-SSPS achieves a 58% EER reduction by
lowering intra-speaker variance, providing comparable performance to DINO-SSPS.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of complex designs while
minimizing waste, but faces challenges related to defects and process
anomalies. This study presents a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation-based framework that automates anomaly detection across various
Additive Manufacturing processes leveraging retrieved information from
literature, including images and descriptive text, rather than training
datasets. This framework integrates text and image retrieval from scientific
literature and multimodal generation models to perform zero-shot anomaly
identification, classification, and explanation generation in a Laser Powder
Bed Fusion setting. The proposed framework is evaluated on four L-PBF
manufacturing datasets from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, featuring various
printer makes, models, and materials. This evaluation demonstrates the
framework's adaptability and generalizability across diverse images without
requiring additional training. Comparative analysis using Qwen2-VL-2B and
GPT-4o-mini as MLLM within the proposed framework highlights that GPT-4o-mini
outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B and proportional random baseline in manufacturing
anomalies classification. Additionally, the evaluation of the RAG system
confirms that incorporating retrieval mechanisms improves average accuracy by
12% by reducing the risk of hallucination and providing additional information.
The proposed framework can be continuously updated by integrating emerging
research, allowing seamless adaptation to the evolving landscape of AM
technologies. This scalable, automated, and zero-shot-capable framework

Abstract: The selection of base station sites is a critical challenge in 5G network
planning, which requires efficient optimization of coverage, cost, user
satisfaction, and practical constraints. Traditional manual methods, reliant on
human expertise, suffer from inefficiencies and are limited to an unsatisfied
planning-construction consistency. Existing AI tools, despite improving
efficiency in certain aspects, still struggle to meet the dynamic network
conditions and multi-objective needs of telecom operators' networks. To address
these challenges, we propose TelePlanNet, an AI-driven framework tailored for
the selection of base station sites, integrating a three-layer architecture for
efficient planning and large-scale automation. By leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for real-time user input processing and intent alignment with
base station planning, combined with training the planning model using the
improved group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning, the
proposed TelePlanNet can effectively address multi-objective optimization,
evaluates candidate sites, and delivers practical solutions. Experiments
results show that the proposed TelePlanNet can improve the consistency to 78%,
which is superior to the manual methods, providing telecom operators with an
efficient and scalable tool that significantly advances cellular network
planning.

While many of these are plausible, they lack an underlying unifying

general method for extending serial iterated belief revision operators to
handle parallel change. This method, based on a family of order aggregators
known as TeamQueue aggregators, provides a principled way to recover the
independently plausible properties that can be found in the literature, without

Conclusion: VeRecycle为随机动力系统的安全认证提供了一种高效的新方法。

Abstract: Autonomous systems operating in the real world encounter a range of
uncertainties. Probabilistic neural Lyapunov certification is a powerful
approach to proving safety of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. When
faced with changes beyond the modeled uncertainties, e.g., unidentified
obstacles, probabilistic certificates must be transferred to the new system
dynamics. However, even when the changes are localized in a known part of the
state space, state-of-the-art requires complete re-certification, which is
particularly costly for neural certificates. We introduce VeRecycle, the first
framework to formally reclaim guarantees for discrete-time stochastic dynamical
systems. VeRecycle efficiently reuses probabilistic certificates when the
system dynamics deviate only in a given subset of states. We present a general
theoretical justification and algorithmic implementation. Our experimental
evaluation shows scenarios where VeRecycle both saves significant computational
effort and achieves competitive probabilistic guarantees in compositional
neural control.

Conclusion: DiMNet通过解耦和动态控制语义特征，显著提升了TKG推理能力。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), as an extension of static Knowledge Graphs
(KGs), incorporate the temporal feature to express the transience of knowledge
by describing when facts occur. TKG extrapolation aims to infer possible future
facts based on known history, which has garnered significant attention in
recent years. Some existing methods treat TKG as a sequence of independent
subgraphs to model temporal evolution patterns, demonstrating impressive
reasoning performance. However, they still have limitations: 1) In modeling
subgraph semantic evolution, they usually neglect the internal structural
interactions between subgraphs, which are actually crucial for encoding TKGs.
2) They overlook the potential smooth features that do not lead to semantic
changes, which should be distinguished from the semantic evolution process.
Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Multi-span Evolutionary Network
(DiMNet) for TKG reasoning. Specifically, we design a multi-span evolution
strategy that captures local neighbor features while perceiving historical
neighbor semantic information, thus enabling internal interactions between
subgraphs during the evolution process. To maximize the capture of semantic
change patterns, we design a disentangle component that adaptively separates
nodes' active and stable features, used to dynamically control the influence of
historical semantics on future evolution. Extensive experiments conducted on
four real-world TKG datasets show that DiMNet demonstrates substantial
performance in TKG reasoning, and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 22.7%
in MRR.

Abstract: Adversarial Patrolling games form a subclass of Security games where a
Defender moves between locations, guarding vulnerable targets. The main
algorithmic problem is constructing a strategy for the Defender that minimizes
the worst damage an Attacker can cause. We focus on the class of finite-memory
(also known as regular) Defender's strategies that experimentally outperformed
other competing classes. A finite-memory strategy can be seen as a positional
strategy on a finite set of states. Each state consists of a pair of a location
and a certain integer value--called memory. Existing algorithms improve the
transitional probabilities between the states but require that the available
memory size itself is assigned at each location manually. Choosing the right
memory assignment is a well-known open and hard problem that hinders the
usability of finite-memory strategies. We solve this issue by developing a
general method that iteratively changes the memory assignment. Our algorithm
can be used in connection with \emph{any} black-box strategy optimization tool.
We evaluate our method on various experiments and show its robustness by
solving instances of various patrolling models.

Conclusion: 动态重新规划框架能有效利用实时数据优化公共交通出行。

Abstract: Delays in public transport are common, often impacting users through
prolonged travel times and missed transfers. Existing solutions for handling
delays remain limited; backup plans based on historical data miss opportunities
for earlier arrivals, while snapshot planning accounts for current delays but
not future ones. With the growing availability of live delay data, users can
adjust their journeys in real-time. However, the literature lacks a framework
that fully exploits this advantage for system-scale dynamic replanning. To
address this, we formalise the dynamic replanning problem in public transport
routing and propose two solutions: a "pull" approach, where users manually
request replanning, and a novel "push" approach, where the server proactively
monitors and adjusts journeys. Our experiments show that the push approach
outperforms the pull approach, achieving significant speedups. The results also
reveal substantial arrival time savings enabled by dynamic replanning.

Abstract: Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly
impacts travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time
signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic
patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across
multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a
simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections
with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability.
A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal
operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations
and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a
baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time
and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically
significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved
throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies
hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency.
More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world
implementation challenges.

Conclusion: 对话结构对情绪同步有重要影响，为多模态情感对齐的时空动态提供了新见解。

Abstract: Understanding how humans express and synchronize emotions across multiple
communication channels particularly facial expressions and speech has
significant implications for emotion recognition systems and human computer
interaction. Motivated by the notion that non-overlapping speech promotes
clearer emotional coordination, while overlapping speech disrupts synchrony,
this study examines how these conversational dynamics shape the spatial and
temporal alignment of arousal and valence across facial and vocal modalities.
Using dyadic interactions from the IEMOCAP dataset, we extracted continuous
emotion estimates via EmoNet (facial video) and a Wav2Vec2-based model (speech
audio). Segments were categorized based on speech overlap, and emotional
alignment was assessed using Pearson correlation, lag adjusted analysis, and
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Across analyses, non overlapping speech was
associated with more stable and predictable emotional synchrony than
overlapping speech. While zero-lag correlations were low and not statistically
different, non overlapping speech showed reduced variability, especially for
arousal. Lag adjusted correlations and best-lag distributions revealed clearer,
more consistent temporal alignment in these segments. In contrast, overlapping
speech exhibited higher variability and flatter lag profiles, though DTW
indicated unexpectedly tighter alignment suggesting distinct coordination
strategies. Notably, directionality patterns showed that facial expressions
more often preceded speech during turn-taking, while speech led during
simultaneous vocalizations. These findings underscore the importance of
conversational structure in regulating emotional communication and provide new
insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of multimodal affective
alignment in real world interaction.

Abstract: Imbalanced data poses a significant obstacle in machine learning, as an
unequal distribution of class labels often results in skewed predictions and
diminished model accuracy. To mitigate this problem, various resampling
strategies have been developed, encompassing both oversampling and
undersampling techniques aimed at modifying class proportions. Conventional
oversampling approaches like SMOTE enhance the representation of the minority
class, whereas undersampling methods focus on trimming down the majority class.
Advances in deep learning have facilitated the creation of more complex
solutions, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs), which are capable of producing high-quality synthetic
examples. This paper reviews a broad spectrum of data balancing methods,
classifying them into categories including synthetic oversampling, adaptive
techniques, generative models, ensemble-based strategies, hybrid approaches,
undersampling, and neighbor-based methods. Furthermore, it highlights current
developments in resampling techniques and discusses practical implementations
and case studies that validate their effectiveness. The paper concludes by

Conclusion: 该方法为临床应用中计算资源受限的场景提供了一种实用的改进方案。

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is essential in medical imaging, and the
Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm is a popular choice for reconstruction due
to its efficiency. However, FDK is susceptible to noise and artifacts. While
recent deep learning methods offer improved image quality, they often increase
computational complexity and lack the interpretability of traditional methods.
In this paper, we introduce an enhanced FDK-based neural network that maintains
the classical algorithm's interpretability by selectively integrating trainable
elements into the cosine weighting and filtering stages. Recognizing the
challenge of a large parameter space inherent in 3D CBCT data, we leverage
wavelet transformations to create sparse representations of the cosine weights
and filters. This strategic sparsification reduces the parameter count by
$93.75\%$ without compromising performance, accelerates convergence, and
importantly, maintains the inference computational cost equivalent to the
classical FDK algorithm. Our method not only ensures volumetric consistency and
boosts robustness to noise, but is also designed for straightforward
integration into existing CT reconstruction pipelines. This presents a
pragmatic enhancement that can benefit clinical applications, particularly in
environments with computational limitations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses both significant risks and valuable

principles such as autonomy, fairness, and trust; and the AI's Positive
Contributions to Democracy (AIPD) taxonomy, which highlights AI's potential to
enhance transparency, participation, efficiency, and evidence-based
policymaking.
  Grounded in the European Union's approach to ethical AI governance, and
particularly the seven Trustworthy AI requirements proposed by the European
Commission's High-Level Expert Group on AI, each identified risk is aligned
with mitigation strategies based on EU regulatory and normative frameworks. Our
analysis underscores the transversal importance of transparency and societal
well-being across all risk categories and offers a structured lens for aligning
AI systems with democratic values.
  By integrating democratic theory with practical governance tools, this paper
offers a normative and actionable framework to guide research, regulation, and
institutional design to support trustworthy, democratic AI. It provides
scholars with a conceptual foundation to evaluate the democratic implications
of AI, equips policymakers with structured criteria for ethical oversight, and
helps technologists align system design with democratic principles. In doing

Abstract: We present a model for predicting articulatory features from surface
electromyography (EMG) signals during speech production. The proposed model
integrates convolutional layers and a Transformer block, followed by separate
predictors for articulatory features. Our approach achieves a high prediction
correlation of approximately 0.9 for most articulatory features. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that these predicted articulatory features can be decoded into
intelligible speech waveforms. To our knowledge, this is the first method to
decode speech waveforms from surface EMG via articulatory features, offering a
novel approach to EMG-based speech synthesis. Additionally, we analyze the
relationship between EMG electrode placement and articulatory feature
predictability, providing knowledge-driven insights for optimizing EMG
electrode configurations. The source code and decoded speech samples are
publicly available.

Abstract: Achieving coordinated teamwork among legged robots requires both fine-grained
locomotion control and long-horizon strategic decision-making. Robot soccer
offers a compelling testbed for this challenge, combining dynamic, competitive,
and multi-agent interactions. In this work, we present a hierarchical
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables fully
autonomous and decentralized quadruped robot soccer. First, a set of highly
dynamic low-level skills is trained for legged locomotion and ball
manipulation, such as walking, dribbling, and kicking. On top of these, a
high-level strategic planning policy is trained with Multi-Agent Proximal
Policy Optimization (MAPPO) via Fictitious Self-Play (FSP). This learning
framework allows agents to adapt to diverse opponent strategies and gives rise
to sophisticated team behaviors, including coordinated passing, interception,
and dynamic role allocation. With an extensive ablation study, the proposed
learning method shows significant advantages in the cooperative and competitive
multi-agent soccer game. We deploy the learned policies to real quadruped
robots relying solely on onboard proprioception and decentralized localization,
with the resulting system supporting autonomous robot-robot and robot-human
soccer matches on indoor and outdoor soccer courts.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of using acoustic features of segmental

because of their close relationship with human articulatory processes and are
expected to be more difficult for deepfake models to replicate. The results
demonstrate that certain segmental features commonly used in forensic voice

audio deepfake detection differently for forensic voice comparison and offer a
new perspective on leveraging segmental features for this purpose.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems demand the high levels of safety assurance.
Despite significant advancements in AD demonstrated on open-source benchmarks
like Longest6 and Bench2Drive, existing datasets still lack
regulatory-compliant scenario libraries for closed-loop testing to
comprehensively evaluate the functional safety of AD. Meanwhile, real-world AD
accidents are underrepresented in current driving datasets. This scarcity leads
to inadequate evaluation of AD performance, posing risks to safety validation
and practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose Safety2Drive,
a safety-critical scenario library designed to evaluate AD systems.
Safety2Drive offers three key contributions. (1) Safety2Drive comprehensively
covers the test items required by standard regulations and contains 70 AD
function test items. (2) Safety2Drive supports the safety-critical scenario
generalization. It has the ability to inject safety threats such as natural
environment corruptions and adversarial attacks cross camera and LiDAR sensors.
(3) Safety2Drive supports multi-dimensional evaluation. In addition to the
evaluation of AD systems, it also supports the evaluation of various perception
tasks, such as object detection and lane detection. Safety2Drive provides a
paradigm from scenario construction to validation, establishing a standardized
test framework for the safe deployment of AD.

Abstract: Effective workplace communication is essential for managerial success, yet
many managers lack access to tailored and sustained training. Although
AI-assisted communication systems may offer scalable training solutions, little
is known about how managers envision the role of AI in helping them improve
their communication skills. To investigate this, we designed a conversational
role-play system, CommCoach, as a functional probe to understand how managers
anticipate using AI to practice their communication skills. Through
semi-structured interviews, participants emphasized the value of adaptive,
low-risk simulations for practicing difficult workplace conversations. They
also highlighted opportunities, including human-AI teaming, transparent and
context-aware feedback, and greater control over AI-generated personas.
AI-assisted communication training should balance personalization, structured
learning objectives, and adaptability to different user styles and contexts.
However, achieving this requires carefully navigating tensions between adaptive
and consistent AI feedback, realism and potential bias, and the open-ended
nature of AI conversations versus structured workplace discourse.

Conclusion: 本文提出的可信声誉博弈为设计经济鲁棒的声誉系统提供了理论基础，并具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Reputation systems play an essential role in the Internet era, as they enable
people to decide whom to trust, by collecting and aggregating data about users'
behavior. Recently, several works proposed the use of reputation for the design
and scalability improvement of decentralized (blockchain) ledgers; however,
such systems are prone to manipulation and to our knowledge no game-theoretic
treatment exists that can support their economic robustness.
  In this work we put forth a new model for the design of what we call, {\em
trustworthy reputation systems}. Concretely, we describe a class of games,
which we term {\em trustworthy reputation games}, that enable a set of users to
report a function of their beliefs about the trustworthiness of each server in
a set -- i.e., their estimate of the probability that this server will behave
according to its specified strategy -- in a way that satisfies the following
properties:
  1. It is $(\epsilon$-)best response for any rational user in the game to play
a prescribed (truthful) strategy according to their true belief.
  2. Assuming that the users' beliefs are not too far from the {\em true}
trustworthiness of the servers, playing the above ($\epsilon-$)Nash equilibrium
allows anyone who observes the users' strategies to estimate the relative
trustworthiness of any two servers.
  Our utilities and decoding function build on a connection between the well
known PageRank algorithm and the problem of trustworthiness discovery, which
can be of independent interest. Finally, we show how the above games are
motivated by and can be leveraged in proof-of-reputation (PoR) blockchains.

Conclusion: 该启发式方法为MIRP问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，并展示了在MIRPLib基准上的潜力。

Abstract: Maritime Inventory Routing Problem (MIRP) plays a crucial role in the
integration of global maritime commerce levels. However, there are still no
well-established methodologies capable of efficiently solving large MIRP
instances or their variants due to the high complexity of the problem. The
adoption of exact methods, typically based on Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
for daily operations is nearly impractical due to the CPU time required, as
planning must be executed multiple times while ensuring high-quality results
within acceptable time limits. Non-MIP-based heuristics are less frequently
applied due to the highly constrained nature of the problem, which makes even
the construction of an effective initial solution challenging. Papageorgiou et
al. (2014) introduced a single-product MIRP as the foundation for MIRPLib,
aiming to provide a collection of publicly available benchmark instances.
However, only a few studies that propose new methodologies have been published
since then. To encourage the use of MIRPLib and facilitate result comparisons,
this study presents a heuristic approach that does not rely on mathematical
optimization techniques to solve a deterministic, finite-horizon,
single-product MIRP. The proposed heuristic combines a variation of a Beam
Search algorithm with an Iterated Local Search procedure. Among the 72
instances tested, the developed methodology can improve the best-known solution
for ten instances within an acceptable CPU time.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and missile
technologies, perimeter-defense game between attackers and defenders for the
protection of critical regions have become increasingly complex and
strategically significant across a wide range of domains. However, existing
studies predominantly focus on small-scale, simplified two-dimensional
scenarios, often overlooking realistic environmental perturbations, motion
dynamics, and inherent heterogeneity--factors that pose substantial challenges
to real-world applicability. To bridge this gap, we investigate large-scale
heterogeneous perimeter-defense game in a three-dimensional setting,
incorporating realistic elements such as motion dynamics and wind fields. We
derive the Nash equilibrium strategies for both attackers and defenders,
characterize the victory regions, and validate our theoretical findings through
extensive simulations. To tackle large-scale heterogeneous control challenges
in defense strategies, we propose an Embedded Mean-Field Actor-Critic (EMFAC)
framework. EMFAC leverages representation learning to enable high-level action
aggregation in a mean-field manner, supporting scalable coordination among
defenders. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight agent-level attention
mechanism based on reward representation, which selectively filters
observations and mean-field information to enhance decision-making efficiency
and accelerate convergence in large-scale tasks. Extensive simulations across
varying scales demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of EMFAC, which
outperforms established baselines in both convergence speed and overall
performance. To further validate practicality, we test EMFAC in small-scale
real-world experiments and conduct detailed analyses, offering deeper insights
into the framework's effectiveness in complex scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML)
have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum
machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex
challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires
expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption
of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding
strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the
performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often
neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that
may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We
propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum
system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an
end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous
optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized
observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum
observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network,
allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream.
Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum
circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably,
it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification
accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML
models.

Conclusion: 选择合适的数据编码方法对QML模型性能有显著影响，但缺乏通用规则，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Data encoding plays a fundamental and distinctive role in Quantum Machine
Learning (QML). While classical approaches process data directly as vectors,
QML may require transforming classical data into quantum states through
encoding circuits, known as quantum feature maps or quantum embeddings. This
step leverages the inherently high-dimensional and non-linear nature of Hilbert
space, enabling more efficient data separation in complex feature spaces that
may be inaccessible to classical methods. This encoding part significantly
affects the performance of the QML model, so it is important to choose the
right encoding method for the dataset to be encoded. However, this choice is
generally arbitrary, since there is no "universal" rule for knowing which
encoding to choose based on a specific set of data. There are currently a
variety of encoding methods using different quantum logic gates. We studied the
most commonly used types of encoding methods and benchmarked them using
different datasets.

Abstract: Voting methods are instrumental design element of democracies. Citizens use
them to express and aggregate their preferences to reach a collective decision.
However, voting outcomes can be as sensitive to voting rules as they are to
people's voting choices. Despite the significance and inter-disciplinary
scientific progress on voting methods, several democracies keep relying on
outdated voting methods that do not fit modern, pluralistic societies well,
while lacking social innovation. Here, we demonstrate how one can upgrade
real-world democracies, namely by using alternative preferential voting methods
such as cumulative voting and the method of equal shares designed for a
proportional representation of voters' preferences. By rigorously assessing a
new participatory budgeting approach applied in the city of Aarau, Switzerland,
we unravel the striking voting outcomes of fair voting methods: more winning
projects with the same budget and broader geographic and preference
representation of citizens by the elected projects, in particular for voters
who used to be under-represented, while promoting novel project ideas. We
provide profound causal evidence showing that citizens prefer proportional
voting methods, which possess strong legitimacy without the need of very
technical specialized explanations. We also reveal strong underlying democratic
values exhibited by citizens who support fair voting methods such as altruism
and compromise. These findings come with a global momentum to unleash a new and
long-awaited participation blueprint of how to upgrade democracies.

Abstract: The characteristics of a sound field are intrinsically linked to the
geometric and spatial properties of the environment surrounding a sound source
and a listener. The physics of sound propagation is captured in a time-domain
signal known as a room impulse response (RIR). Prior work using neural fields
(NFs) has allowed learning spatially-continuous representations of RIRs from
finite RIR measurements. However, previous NF-based methods have focused on
monaural omnidirectional or at most binaural listeners, which does not
precisely capture the directional characteristics of a real sound field at a
single point. We propose a direction-aware neural field (DANF) that more
explicitly incorporates the directional information by Ambisonic-format RIRs.
While DANF inherently captures spatial relations between sources and listeners,
we further propose a direction-aware loss. In addition, we investigate the
ability of DANF to adapt to new rooms in various ways including low-rank
adaptation.

Abstract: Pulmonary segment segmentation is crucial for cancer localization and
surgical planning. However, the pixel-wise annotation of pulmonary segments is
laborious, as the boundaries between segments are indistinguishable in medical
images. To this end, we propose a weakly supervised learning (WSL) method,
termed Anatomy-Hierarchy Supervised Learning (AHSL), which consults the precise
clinical anatomical definition of pulmonary segments to perform pulmonary
segment segmentation. Since pulmonary segments reside within the lobes and are
determined by the bronchovascular tree, i.e., artery, airway and vein, the
design of the loss function is founded on two principles. First, segment-level
labels are utilized to directly supervise the output of the pulmonary segments,
ensuring that they accurately encompass the appropriate bronchovascular tree.
Second, lobe-level supervision indirectly oversees the pulmonary segment,
ensuring their inclusion within the corresponding lobe. Besides, we introduce a
two-stage segmentation strategy that incorporates bronchovascular priori
information. Furthermore, a consistency loss is proposed to enhance the
smoothness of segment boundaries, along with an evaluation metric designed to
measure the smoothness of pulmonary segment boundaries. Visual inspection and
evaluation metrics from experiments conducted on a private dataset demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: We study Transformers through the perspective of optimal control theory,
using tools from continuous-time formulations to derive actionable insights
into training and architecture design. This framework improves the performance
of existing Transformer models while providing desirable theoretical
guarantees, including generalization and robustness. Our framework is designed
to be plug-and-play, enabling seamless integration with established Transformer
models and requiring only slight changes to the implementation. We conduct
seven extensive experiments on tasks motivated by text generation, sentiment
analysis, image classification, and point cloud classification. Experimental
results show that the framework improves the test performance of the baselines,
while being more parameter-efficient. On character-level text generation with
nanoGPT, our framework achieves a 46% reduction in final test loss while using
42% fewer parameters. On GPT-2, our framework achieves a 5.6% reduction in
final test loss, demonstrating scalability to larger models. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that applies optimal control theory to both
the training and architecture of Transformers. It offers a new foundation for
systematic, theory-driven improvements and moves beyond costly trial-and-error
approaches.

TL;DR: LoRASuite是一种模块化方法，用于高效利用现有LoRA权重适应新版LLM，避免从头训练，显著提升性能并减少资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM频繁更新，传统从头训练LoRA权重的方式成本高、耗时长且不环保，需高效利用现有权重适应新模型。

Method: 通过计算新旧LLM参数的转移矩阵，基于对齐和相似性指标分配层和注意力头，并进行小规模微调。

Result: LoRASuite在MiniCPM和Qwen等LLM上表现优于小规模LoRA方法，甚至超越全规模LoRA训练，数学任务平均提升1.4和6.6分，内存减少5.5GB，计算时间缩短78.23%。

Conclusion: LoRASuite提供了一种高效、资源友好的方式，使LoRA权重适应新版LLM，具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently updated, LoRA weights trained
on earlier versions quickly become obsolete. The conventional practice of
retraining LoRA weights from scratch on the latest model is costly,
time-consuming, and environmentally detrimental, particularly as the diversity
of LLMs and downstream tasks expands. This motivates a critical question: "How
can we efficiently leverage existing LoRA weights to adapt to newer model
versions?" To address this, we propose LoRASuite, a modular approach tailored
specifically to various types of LLM updates. First, we compute a transfer
matrix utilizing known parameters from both old and new LLMs. Next, we allocate
corresponding layers and attention heads based on centered kernel alignment and
cosine similarity metrics, respectively. A subsequent small-scale, skillful
fine-tuning step ensures numerical stability. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that LoRASuite consistently surpasses small-scale vanilla LoRA
methods. Notably, on backbone LLMs such as MiniCPM and Qwen, LoRASuite even
exceeds the performance of full-scale LoRA retraining, with average
improvements of +1.4 and +6.6 points on math tasks, respectively. Additionally,
LoRASuite significantly reduces memory consumption by 5.5 GB and computational
time by 78.23%.

Motivation: Transformer的KV缓存随序列长度线性增长，成为推理效率的瓶颈。MTLA旨在进一步压缩KV缓存，提升推理速度和内存效率。

Method: MTLA采用超网络动态合并时间相邻的KV缓存向量，并提出步长感知因果掩码以解决压缩KV缓存与序列长度不匹配的问题。

Result: 在语音翻译等任务中，MTLA相比标准多头注意力（MHA）实现了5.3倍的速度提升和8.3倍的内存节省，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: MTLA是一种高效的自注意力推理方法，显著提升了推理速度和内存效率，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: While Transformer self-attention offers strong parallelism, the Key-Value
(KV) cache grows linearly with sequence length and becomes a bottleneck for
inference efficiency. Multi-head latent attention was recently developed to
compress the KV cache into a low-rank latent space. This paper proposes
Multi-head Temporal Latent Attention (MTLA), which further reduces the KV cache
size along the temporal dimension, greatly lowering the memory footprint of
self-attention inference. MTLA employs a hyper-network to dynamically merge
temporally adjacent KV cache vectors. To address the mismatch between the
compressed KV cache and processed sequence lengths, a stride-aware causal mask
is proposed to ensure efficient parallel training and consistency with
inference behaviour. Experiments across tasks, including speech translation,
speech recognition, speech understanding and text summarisation, demonstrate
that MTLA achieves competitive performance compared to standard Multi-Head
Attention (MHA), while greatly improving inference speed and GPU memory usage.
For example, on a English-German speech translation task, MTLA achieves a 5.3x
speedup and a reduction in GPU memory usage by a factor of 8.3 compared to MHA,
while maintaining translation quality.

Conclusion: FedPrLLM为隐私敏感领域的LLM剪枝提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLM pruning has emerged as a promising technology for compressing LLMs,
enabling their deployment on resource-limited devices. However, current
methodologies typically require access to public calibration samples, which can
be challenging to obtain in privacy-sensitive domains. To address this issue,
we introduce FedPrLLM, a comprehensive federated pruning framework designed for
the privacy-preserving compression of LLMs. In FedPrLLM, each client only needs
to calculate a pruning mask matrix based on its local calibration data and
share it with the server to prune the global model. This approach allows for
collaborative pruning of the global model with the knowledge of each client
while maintaining local data privacy. Additionally, we conduct extensive
experiments to explore various possibilities within the FedPrLLM framework,
including different comparison groups, pruning strategies, and the decision to
scale weights. Our extensive evaluation reveals that one-shot pruning with
layer comparison and no weight scaling is the optimal choice within the
FedPrLLM framework. We hope our work will help guide future efforts in pruning
LLMs in privacy-sensitive fields. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有delta压缩方法在存储和性能上的不足，提出无需数据的高效压缩方案。

Method: 结合方差稀疏分配、分布感知压缩和迹范数重缩放，优化delta权重压缩。

Result: 在LLM、NLP、视觉和多模态模型中，UltraDelta压缩率高达133x-800x，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UltraDelta在超高压缩下仍能保持模型性能，为多任务模型存储提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rise of the fine-tuned--pretrained paradigm, storing numerous
fine-tuned models for multi-tasking creates significant storage overhead. Delta
compression alleviates this by storing only the pretrained model and the highly
compressed delta weights (the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained
model weights). However, existing methods fail to maintain both high
compression and performance, and often rely on data. To address these
challenges, we propose UltraDelta, the first data-free delta compression
pipeline that achieves both ultra-high compression and strong performance.
UltraDelta is designed to minimize redundancy, maximize information, and
stabilize performance across inter-layer, intra-layer, and global dimensions,
using three key components: (1) Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation
assigns sparsity based on variance, giving lower sparsity to high-variance
layers to preserve inter-layer information. (2) Distribution-Aware Compression
applies uniform quantization and then groups parameters by value, followed by
group-wise pruning, to better preserve intra-layer distribution. (3)
Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling uses the trace norm of delta weights to estimate a
global rescaling factor, improving model stability under higher compression.
Extensive experiments across (a) large language models (fine-tuned on LLaMA-2
7B and 13B) with up to 133x, (b) general NLP models (RoBERTa-base, T5-base)
with up to 800x, (c) vision models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14) with up to 400x, and
(d) multi-modal models (BEiT-3) with 40x compression ratio, demonstrate that
UltraDelta consistently outperforms existing methods, especially under
ultra-high compression.

Motivation: 传统运营研究和管理科学方法依赖于特定任务的解析模型，缺乏通用性和数据驱动的灵活性。OMGPT旨在利用预训练数据和Transformer架构，实现更通用和强大的序列决策建模。

Method: 提出通用序列建模框架，将多种运营任务（如动态定价、库存管理）视为序列预测问题；训练基于Transformer的OMGPT模型，无需假设解析模型结构。

Conclusion: OMGPT为运营研究和管理科学任务提供了一种新的通用数据驱动方法，展示了Transformer架构在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: We build a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model from scratch to
solve sequential decision making tasks arising in contexts of operations
research and management science which we call OMGPT. We first propose a general
sequence modeling framework to cover several operational decision making tasks
as special cases, such as dynamic pricing, inventory management, resource
allocation, and queueing control. Under the framework, all these tasks can be
viewed as a sequential prediction problem where the goal is to predict the
optimal future action given all the historical information. Then we train a
transformer-based neural network model (OMGPT) as a natural and powerful
architecture for sequential modeling. This marks a paradigm shift compared to
the existing methods for these OR/OM tasks in that (i) the OMGPT model can take
advantage of the huge amount of pre-trained data; (ii) when tackling these
problems, OMGPT does not assume any analytical model structure and enables a
direct and rich mapping from the history to the future actions. Either of these
two aspects, to the best of our knowledge, is not achieved by any existing
method. We establish a Bayesian perspective to theoretically understand the
working mechanism of the OMGPT on these tasks, which relates its performance
with the pre-training task diversity and the divergence between the testing
task and pre-training tasks. Numerically, we observe a surprising performance
of the proposed model across all the above tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities
but remain prone to inconsistencies and hallucinations. We introduce Peer
Elicitation Games (PEG), a training-free, game-theoretic framework for aligning
LLMs through a peer elicitation mechanism involving a generator and multiple
discriminators instantiated from distinct base models. Discriminators interact
in a peer evaluation setting, where rewards are computed using a
determinant-based mutual information score that provably incentivizes truthful
reporting without requiring ground-truth labels. We establish theoretical
guarantees showing that each agent, via online learning, achieves sublinear
regret in the sense their cumulative performance approaches that of the best
fixed truthful strategy in hindsight. Moreover, we prove last-iterate
convergence to a truthful Nash equilibrium, ensuring that the actual policies
used by agents converge to stable and truthful behavior over time. Empirical
evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in
factual accuracy. These results position PEG as a practical approach for
eliciting truthful behavior from LLMs without supervision or fine-tuning.

Result: 实验表明监督微调（含正负样本）性能与GRPO相当，且RL的结构假设可能误导性地鼓励生成长序列。

Conclusion: RL虽可能提升LLM推理能力，但当前的结构假设和框架存在局限性，需重新审视其设计和解释。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based post-training of large language models (LLMs)
has recently gained attention, particularly following the release of DeepSeek
R1, which applied GRPO for fine-tuning. Amid the growing hype around improved
reasoning abilities attributed to RL post-training, we critically examine the
formulation and assumptions underlying these methods. We start by highlighting
the popular structural assumptions made in modeling LLM training as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP), and show how they lead to a degenerate MDP that doesn't
quite need the RL/GRPO apparatus. The two critical structural assumptions
include (1) making the MDP states be just a concatenation of the actions-with
states becoming the context window and the actions becoming the tokens in LLMs
and (2) splitting the reward of a state-action trajectory uniformly across the
trajectory. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that these
simplifying assumptions make the approach effectively equivalent to an
outcome-driven supervised learning. Our experiments on benchmarks including
GSM8K and Countdown using Qwen-2.5 base models show that iterative supervised
fine-tuning, incorporating both positive and negative samples, achieves
performance comparable to GRPO-based training. We will also argue that the
structural assumptions indirectly incentivize the RL to generate longer
sequences of intermediate tokens-which in turn feeds into the narrative of "RL
generating longer thinking traces." While RL may well be a very useful
technique for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs, our analysis shows
that the simplistic structural assumptions made in modeling the underlying MDP
render the popular LLM RL frameworks and their interpretations questionable.

Result: 发现最优权重衰减与批量大小线性相关，批量大小的最优和临界值与数据集大小呈幂律关系。

Conclusion: 提出的缩放规律可提前预测超参数，为大规模训练提供指导。

Abstract: Efficient LLM pre-training requires well-tuned hyperparameters (HPs),
including learning rate {\eta} and weight decay {\lambda}. We study scaling
laws for HPs: formulas for how to scale HPs as we scale model size N, dataset
size D, and batch size B. Recent work suggests the AdamW timescale,
B/({\eta}{\lambda}D), should remain constant across training settings, and we
verify the implication that optimal {\lambda} scales linearly with B, for a
fixed N,D. However, as N,D scale, we show the optimal timescale obeys a precise
power law in the tokens-per-parameter ratio, D/N. This law thus provides a
method to accurately predict {\lambda}opt in advance of large-scale training.
We also study scaling laws for optimal batch size Bopt (the B enabling lowest
loss at a given N,D) and critical batch size Bcrit (the B beyond which further
data parallelism becomes ineffective). In contrast with prior work, we find
both Bopt and Bcrit scale as power laws in D, independent of model size, N.
Finally, we analyze how these findings inform the real-world selection of
Pareto-optimal N and D under dual training time and compute objectives.

Abstract: This paper investigates a hybrid learning framework for reinforcement

online interactions to learn the optimal policy. We present a unified algorithm
and analysis and show that augmenting confidence-based online RL algorithms
with the offline dataset outperforms any pure online or offline algorithm alone
and achieves state-of-the-art results under two learning metrics, i.e.,
sub-optimality gap and online learning regret. Specifically, we show that our
algorithm achieves a sub-optimality gap
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^*|\rho)+N_1}) )$, where
$\mathtt{C}(\pi^*|\rho)$ is a new concentrability coefficient, $N_0$ and $N_1$
are the numbers of offline and online samples, respectively. For regret
minimization, we show that it achieves a constant $\tilde{O}(
\sqrt{N_1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^{-}|\rho)+N_1)} )$ speed-up compared to pure
online learning, where $\mathtt{C}(\pi^-|\rho)$ is the concentrability
coefficient over all sub-optimal policies. Our results also reveal an
interesting separation on the desired coverage properties of the offline
dataset for sub-optimality gap minimization and regret minimization. We further
validate our theoretical findings in several experiments in special RL models
such as linear contextual bandits and Markov decision processes (MDPs).

Abstract: Recent impressive results from large reasoning models have been interpreted
as a triumph of Chain of Thought (CoT), and especially of the process of
training on CoTs sampled from base LLMs in order to help find new reasoning
patterns. In this paper, we critically examine that interpretation by
investigating how the semantics of intermediate tokens-often anthropomorphized
as "thoughts" or reasoning traces and which are claimed to display behaviors
like backtracking, self-verification etc.-actually influence model performance.
We train transformer models on formally verifiable reasoning traces and
solutions, constraining both intermediate steps and final outputs to align with
those of a formal solver (in our case, A* search). By constructing a formal
interpreter of the semantics of our problems and intended algorithm, we
systematically evaluate not only solution accuracy but also the correctness of
intermediate traces, thus allowing us to evaluate whether the latter causally
influences the former. We notice that, despite significant improvements on the
solution-only baseline, models trained on entirely correct traces still produce
invalid reasoning traces when arriving at correct solutions. To further show
that trace accuracy is only loosely connected to solution accuracy, we then
train models on noisy, corrupted traces which have no relation to the specific
problem each is paired with, and find that not only does performance remain
largely consistent with models trained on correct data, but in some cases can
improve upon it and generalize more robustly on out-of-distribution tasks.
These results challenge the assumption that intermediate tokens or "Chains of
Thought" induce predictable reasoning behaviors and caution against
anthropomorphizing such outputs or over-interpreting them (despite their mostly
correct forms) as evidence of human-like or algorithmic behaviors in language
models.

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable, deceptive behaviors can undermine
evaluation and mislead users at deployment. Recent work has shown that lie
detectors can accurately classify deceptive behavior, but they are not
typically used in the training pipeline due to concerns around contamination
and objective hacking. We examine these concerns by incorporating a lie
detector into the labelling step of LLM post-training and evaluating whether
the learned policy is genuinely more honest, or instead learns to fool the lie
detector while remaining deceptive. Using DolusChat, a novel 65k-example
dataset with paired truthful/deceptive responses, we identify three key factors
that determine the honesty of learned policies: amount of exploration during
preference learning, lie detector accuracy, and KL regularization strength. We
find that preference learning with lie detectors and GRPO can lead to policies
which evade lie detectors, with deception rates of over 85\%. However, if the
lie detector true positive rate (TPR) or KL regularization is sufficiently
high, GRPO learns honest policies. In contrast, off-policy algorithms (DPO)
consistently lead to deception rates under 25\% for realistic TPRs. Our results
illustrate a more complex picture than previously assumed: depending on the
context, lie-detector-enhanced training can be a powerful tool for scalable
oversight, or a counterproductive method encouraging undetectable misalignment.

Conclusion: 上下文无关生成是一种简单且有效的方法，可用于缓解语言模型微调中的遗忘问题。

Abstract: Fine-tuning a language model often results in a degradation of its existing
performance on other tasks, due to a shift in the model parameters; this
phenomenon is often referred to as (catastrophic) forgetting. We are interested
in mitigating this, in settings where we only have access to the model weights
but no access to its training data/recipe. A natural approach is to penalize
the KL divergence between the original model and the new one. Our main
realization is that a simple process - which we term context-free generation -
allows for an approximate unbiased estimation of this KL divergence. We show
that augmenting a fine-tuning dataset with context-free generations mitigates
forgetting, in two settings: (a) preserving the zero-shot performance of
pretrained-only models, and (b) preserving the reasoning performance of
thinking models. We show that contextual synthetic data, and even a portion of
the pretraining data, are less effective. We also investigate the effect of
choices like generation temperature, data ratios etc. We present our results
for OLMo-1B for pretrained-only setting and R1-Distill-Llama-8B for the

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive training data through
memorization and membership inference attacks. Prior work has primarily focused
on strong adversarial assumptions, including attacker access to entire samples
or long, ordered prefixes, leaving open the question of how vulnerable LLMs are
when adversaries have only partial, unordered sample information. For example,
if an attacker knows a patient has "hypertension," under what conditions can
they query a model fine-tuned on patient data to learn the patient also has
"osteoarthritis?" In this paper, we introduce a more general threat model under
this weaker assumption and show that fine-tuned LLMs are susceptible to these
fragment-specific extraction attacks. To systematically investigate these
attacks, we propose two data-blind methods: (1) a likelihood ratio attack
inspired by methods from membership inference, and (2) a novel approach, PRISM,
which regularizes the ratio by leveraging an external prior. Using examples
from both medical and legal settings, we show that both methods are competitive
with a data-aware baseline classifier that assumes access to labeled
in-distribution data, underscoring their robustness.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）作为决策代理具有强大能力，但实际部署受限于高推理成本和大模型规模。

Conclusion: 分段对齐对高效且可部署的代理至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities as decision-making
agents by interleaving reasoning and actions, as seen in ReAct-style
frameworks. Yet, their practical deployment is constrained by high inference
costs and large model sizes. We propose Structured Agent Distillation, a
framework that compresses large LLM-based agents into smaller student models
while preserving both reasoning fidelity and action consistency. Unlike
standard token-level distillation, our method segments trajectories into
{[REASON]} and {[ACT]} spans, applying segment-specific losses to align each
component with the teacher's behavior. This structure-aware supervision enables
compact agents to better replicate the teacher's decision process. Experiments
on ALFWorld, HotPotQA-ReAct, and WebShop show that our approach consistently
outperforms token-level and imitation learning baselines, achieving significant
compression with minimal performance drop. Scaling and ablation results further
highlight the importance of span-level alignment for efficient and deployable
agents.

Conclusion: 该框架是约束函数的通用逼近器，无需迭代或运行时优化即可保证约束满足。

Abstract: Deep learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical tasks where
predictions must satisfy hard constraints, such as physical laws, fairness
requirements, or safety limits. However, standard architectures lack built-in
mechanisms to enforce such constraints, and existing approaches based on
regularization or projection are often limited to simple constraints,
computationally expensive, or lack feasibility guarantees. This paper proposes
a model-agnostic framework for enforcing input-dependent linear equality and
inequality constraints on neural network outputs. The architecture combines a
task network trained for prediction accuracy with a safe network trained using
decision rules from the stochastic and robust optimization literature to ensure
feasibility across the entire input space. The final prediction is a convex
combination of the two subnetworks, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction during
both training and inference without iterative procedures or runtime
optimization. We prove that the architecture is a universal approximator of
constrained functions and derive computationally tractable formulations based
on linear decision rules. Empirical results on benchmark regression tasks show
that our method consistently satisfies constraints while maintaining
competitive accuracy and low inference latency.

Conclusion: InfiFPO通过保留概率信息有效解决了偏好对齐阶段的融合问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Model fusion combines multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) with different
strengths into a more powerful, integrated model through lightweight training
methods. Existing works on model fusion focus primarily on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), leaving preference alignment (PA) --a critical phase for
enhancing LLM performance--largely unexplored. The current few fusion methods
on PA phase, like WRPO, simplify the process by utilizing only response outputs
from source models while discarding their probability information. To address
this limitation, we propose InfiFPO, a preference optimization method for
implicit model fusion. InfiFPO replaces the reference model in Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) with a fused source model that synthesizes
multi-source probabilities at the sequence level, circumventing complex
vocabulary alignment challenges in previous works and meanwhile maintaining the
probability information. By introducing probability clipping and max-margin
fusion strategies, InfiFPO enables the pivot model to align with human
preferences while effectively distilling knowledge from source models.
Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that InfiFPO
consistently outperforms existing model fusion and preference optimization
methods. When using Phi-4 as the pivot model, InfiFPO improve its average
performance from 79.95 to 83.33 on 11 benchmarks, significantly improving its
capabilities in mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks.

Method: 分析Llama 3.1和Qwen 3模型的残差流，比较子层输出，跳过层的影响，以及训练浅层到深层的线性映射。

Result: 深度模型的第二半层贡献较小，且未发现多跳任务中深度增加带来子结果组合的证据；深层模型仅将相同计算分散到更多层。

Conclusion: 深度增加并未带来新的计算类型，而是用于对残差进行更细粒度的调整，解释了Transformer架构规模扩大的收益递减现象。

Abstract: Modern LLMs are increasingly deep, and depth correlates with performance,
albeit with diminishing returns. However, do these models use their depth
efficiently? Do they compose more features to create higher-order computations
that are impossible in shallow models, or do they merely spread the same kinds
of computation out over more layers? To address these questions, we analyze the
residual stream of the Llama 3.1 and Qwen 3 family of models. We find: First,
comparing the output of the sublayers to the residual stream reveals that
layers in the second half contribute much less than those in the first half,
with a clear phase transition between the two halves. Second, skipping layers
in the second half has a much smaller effect on future computations and output
predictions. Third, for multihop tasks, we are unable to find evidence that
models are using increased depth to compose subresults in examples involving
many hops. Fourth, we seek to directly address whether deeper models are using
their additional layers to perform new kinds of computation. To do this, we
train linear maps from the residual stream of a shallow model to a deeper one.
We find that layers with the same relative depth map best to each other,
suggesting that the larger model simply spreads the same computations out over
its many layers. All this evidence suggests that deeper models are not using
their depth to learn new kinds of computation, but only using the greater depth
to perform more fine-grained adjustments to the residual. This may help explain
why increasing scale leads to diminishing returns for stacked Transformer
architectures.

framework that leverages reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)
to directly optimize world models for such metrics. Despite formulating world
modeling as autoregressive prediction of tokenized sequences, RLVR-World
evaluates metrics of decoded predictions as verifiable rewards. We demonstrate
substantial performance gains on both language- and video-based world models

Our work indicates that, beyond recent advances in reasoning language models,
RLVR offers a promising post-training paradigm for enhancing the utility of
generative models more broadly.

Abstract: This paper formalizes an emerging learning paradigm that uses a trained model
as a reference to guide and enhance the training of a target model through
strategic data selection or weighting, named $\textbf{model steering}$. While
ad-hoc methods have been used in various contexts, including the training of
large foundation models, its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose a
theory-driven framework for model steering called $\textbf{DRRho risk
minimization}$, which is rooted in Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO).
Through a generalization analysis, we provide theoretical insights into why
this approach improves generalization and data efficiency compared to training
without a reference model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
such theoretical insights are provided for the new learning paradigm, which
significantly enhance our understanding and practice of model steering.
Building on these insights and the connection between contrastive learning and
DRO, we introduce a novel method for Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP) with a reference model, termed DRRho-CLIP. Extensive experiments
validate the theoretical insights, reveal a superior scaling law compared to
CLIP without a reference model, and demonstrate its strength over existing
heuristic approaches.

Abstract: Adversarial training is one of the most effective adversarial defenses, but
it incurs a high computational cost. In this study, we show that transformers
adversarially pretrained on diverse tasks can serve as robust foundation models
and eliminate the need for adversarial training in downstream tasks.
Specifically, we theoretically demonstrate that through in-context learning, a
single adversarially pretrained transformer can robustly generalize to multiple
unseen tasks without any additional training, i.e., without any parameter
updates. This robustness stems from the model's focus on robust features and
its resistance to attacks that exploit non-predictive features. Besides these
positive findings, we also identify several limitations. Under certain
conditions (though unrealistic), no universally robust single-layer
transformers exist. Moreover, robust transformers exhibit an
accuracy--robustness trade-off and require a large number of in-context
demonstrations. The code is available at

Abstract: Steering methods have emerged as effective and targeted tools for guiding
large language models' (LLMs) behavior without modifying their parameters.
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), however, do not currently enjoy the
same suite of techniques, due in part to their recency and architectural
diversity. Inspired by this gap, we investigate whether MLLMs can be steered
using vectors derived from their text-only LLM backbone, via sparse
autoencoders (SAEs), mean shift, and linear probing. We find that text-derived
steering consistently enhances multimodal accuracy across diverse MLLM
architectures and visual tasks. In particular, mean shift boosts spatial
relationship accuracy on CV-Bench by up to +7.3% and counting accuracy by up to
+3.3%, outperforming prompting and exhibiting strong generalization to
out-of-distribution datasets. These results highlight textual steering vectors
as a powerful, efficient mechanism for enhancing grounding in MLLMs with
minimal additional data collection and computational overhead.

Result: TTMM性能随专家数量增加而提升，接近TTT，且1B参数模型下速度快100倍。

Conclusion: TTMM是一种高效扩展测试时训练的方法，成本效益显著。

Abstract: Mixture of expert (MoE) models are a promising approach to increasing model
capacity without increasing inference cost, and are core components of many
state-of-the-art language models. However, current MoE models typically use
only few experts due to prohibitive training and inference cost. We propose
Test-Time Model Merging (TTMM) which scales the MoE paradigm to an order of
magnitude more experts and uses model merging to avoid almost any test-time
overhead. We show that TTMM is an approximation of test-time training (TTT),
which fine-tunes an expert model for each prediction task, i.e., prompt. TTT
has recently been shown to significantly improve language models, but is
computationally expensive. We find that performance of TTMM improves with more
experts and approaches the performance of TTT. Moreover, we find that with a 1B
parameter base model, TTMM is more than 100x faster than TTT at test-time by
amortizing the cost of TTT at train-time. Thus, TTMM offers a promising
cost-effective approach to scale test-time training.

Result: 安全行为与不安全行为共享相同的子空间和表征，未发现选择性控制安全的子空间。

Conclusion: 安全对齐并非局部化，而是源于模型学习动态中的高影响组件，子空间防御可能面临根本限制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on safety alignment to produce socially
acceptable responses. This is typically achieved through instruction tuning and
reinforcement learning from human feedback. However, this alignment is known to
be brittle: further fine-tuning, even on benign or lightly contaminated data,
can degrade safety and reintroduce harmful behaviors. A growing body of work
suggests that alignment may correspond to identifiable geometric directions in
weight space, forming subspaces that could, in principle, be isolated or
preserved to defend against misalignment. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive empirical study of this geometric perspective. We examine whether
safety-relevant behavior is concentrated in specific subspaces, whether it can
be separated from general-purpose learning, and whether harmfulness arises from
distinguishable patterns in internal representations. Across both parameter and
activation space, our findings are consistent: subspaces that amplify safe
behaviors also amplify unsafe ones, and prompts with different safety
implications activate overlapping representations. We find no evidence of a
subspace that selectively governs safety. These results challenge the
assumption that alignment is geometrically localized. Rather than residing in
distinct directions, safety appears to emerge from entangled, high-impact
components of the model's broader learning dynamics. This suggests that
subspace-based defenses may face fundamental limitations and underscores the
need for alternative strategies to preserve alignment under continued training.
We corroborate these findings through multiple experiments on five open-source
LLMs. Our code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: FLASH-D是一种高效且硬件友好的注意力计算优化方法，适用于大规模模型训练和推理。

Abstract: The transformer's attention mechanism has revolutionized AI and machine
learning, with its efficient computation being crucial to its performance.
However, calculating attention involves matrix operations interspersed with
softmax rescaling, which inherently slows down computation and requires
processing the entire input sequence. Building on online softmax computation,
FlashAttention integrates softmax calculation with matrix arithmetic, enabling
tiled computation independent of sequence length. While optimized for GPUs,
FlashAttention's simplicity makes it amenable to direct hardware acceleration.
This work re-evaluates the core FlashAttention kernel, presenting FLASH-D a
mathematically equivalent, yet simplified, formulation that achieves: (a)
hiding softmax division within other non-linear function evaluations; (b)
inherently numerically stable computation of exponentials, eliminating the need
for maximum value subtraction; and (c) a reduction in computational cost
without introducing numerical approximations to the FlashAttention kernel.
Importantly, the essential FlashAttention properties that facilitate efficient
tiled implementation are fully preserved. Hardware implementation results at
28nm demonstrate that this proposed formulation achieves a 22.8% reduction in
area and a 20.3% reduction in power, on average, compared to state-of-the-art
parallel hardware architectures without any performance penalty.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
especially in scenarios where supervised fine-tuning (SFT) falls short due to
limited chain-of-thought (CoT) data. Among RL-based post-training methods,
group relative advantage estimation, as exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), has attracted considerable attention for eliminating the
dependency on the value model, thereby simplifying training compared to
traditional approaches like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, we
observe that exsiting group relative advantage estimation method still suffers
from training inefficiencies, particularly when the estimated advantage
approaches zero. To address this limitation, we propose Advantage-Augmented
Policy Optimization (AAPO), a novel RL algorithm that optimizes the
cross-entropy (CE) loss using advantages enhanced through a momentum-based
estimation scheme. This approach effectively mitigates the inefficiencies
associated with group relative advantage estimation. Experimental results on
multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance
of AAPO.

Conclusion: 研究为QAT的改进提供了关键见解，尤其是在权重和激活量化误差平衡方面。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory
resources, creating deployment challenges. Quantization-aware training (QAT)
addresses these challenges by reducing model precision while maintaining
performance. However, the scaling behavior of QAT, especially at 4-bit
precision (W4A4), is not well understood. Existing QAT scaling laws often
ignore key factors such as the number of training tokens and quantization
granularity, which limits their applicability. This paper proposes a unified
scaling law for QAT that models quantization error as a function of model size,
training data volume, and quantization group size. Through 268 QAT experiments,
we show that quantization error decreases as model size increases, but rises
with more training tokens and coarser quantization granularity. To identify the
sources of W4A4 quantization error, we decompose it into weight and activation
components. Both components follow the overall trend of W4A4 quantization
error, but with different sensitivities. Specifically, weight quantization
error increases more rapidly with more training tokens. Further analysis shows
that the activation quantization error in the FC2 layer, caused by outliers, is
the primary bottleneck of W4A4 QAT quantization error. By applying
mixed-precision quantization to address this bottleneck, we demonstrate that
weight and activation quantization errors can converge to similar levels.
Additionally, with more training data, weight quantization error eventually
exceeds activation quantization error, suggesting that reducing weight
quantization error is also important in such scenarios. These findings offer
key insights for improving QAT research and development.

Abstract: As language models become more powerful and sophisticated, it is crucial that
they remain trustworthy and reliable. There is concerning preliminary evidence
that models may attempt to deceive or keep secrets from their operators. To
explore the ability of current techniques to elicit such hidden knowledge, we
train a Taboo model: a language model that describes a specific secret word
without explicitly stating it. Importantly, the secret word is not presented to
the model in its training data or prompt. We then investigate methods to
uncover this secret. First, we evaluate non-interpretability (black-box)
approaches. Subsequently, we develop largely automated strategies based on
mechanistic interpretability techniques, including logit lens and sparse
autoencoders. Evaluation shows that both approaches are effective in eliciting
the secret word in our proof-of-concept setting. Our findings highlight the
promise of these approaches for eliciting hidden knowledge and suggest several
promising avenues for future work, including testing and refining these methods
on more complex model organisms. This work aims to be a step towards addressing
the crucial problem of eliciting secret knowledge from language models, thereby

Abstract: We propose a new interpretability method for neural networks, which is based
on a novel mathematico-philosophical theory of reasons. Our method computes a
vector for each neuron, called its reasons vector. We then can compute how
strongly this reasons vector speaks for various propositions, e.g., the
proposition that the input image depicts digit 2 or that the input prompt has a
negative sentiment. This yields an interpretation of neurons, and groups
thereof, that combines a logical and a Bayesian perspective, and accounts for
polysemanticity (i.e., that a single neuron can figure in multiple concepts).
We show, both theoretically and empirically, that this method is: (1) grounded
in a philosophically established notion of explanation, (2) uniform, i.e.,
applies to the common neural network architectures and modalities, (3)
scalable, since computing reason vectors only involves forward-passes in the
neural network, (4) faithful, i.e., intervening on a neuron based on its reason
vector leads to expected changes in model output, (5) correct in that the
model's reasons structure matches that of the data source, (6) trainable, i.e.,
neural networks can be trained to improve their reason strengths, (7) useful,
i.e., it delivers on the needs for interpretability by increasing, e.g.,
robustness and fairness.

Motivation: 传统Transformer的离散层设计效率低下，而连续层在图像生成中表现优越，因此探索连续层在LLM中的应用。

Method: LFT用单个学习的传输算子替代多个层，并通过Flow Walking (FW)算法解决耦合问题。

Result: 在Pythia-410M上，LFT压缩6层性能优于跳过2层，FW进一步压缩12层且性能接近跳过3层。

Conclusion: LFT展示了连续层在LLM中的可行性，缩小了自回归与流生成范式间的差距。

Abstract: Transformers, the standard implementation for large language models (LLMs),
typically consist of tens to hundreds of discrete layers. While more layers can
lead to better performance, this approach has been challenged as far from
efficient, especially given the superiority of continuous layers demonstrated
by diffusion and flow-based models for image generation. We propose the Latent
Flow Transformer (LFT), which replaces a block of layers with a single learned
transport operator trained via flow matching, offering significant compression
while maintaining compatibility with the original architecture. Additionally,
we address the limitations of existing flow-based methods in \textit{preserving
coupling} by introducing the Flow Walking (FW) algorithm. On the Pythia-410M
model, LFT trained with flow matching compresses 6 of 24 layers and outperforms
directly skipping 2 layers (KL Divergence of LM logits at 0.407 vs. 0.529),
demonstrating the feasibility of this design. When trained with FW, LFT further
distills 12 layers into one while reducing the KL to 0.736 surpassing that from
skipping 3 layers (0.932), significantly narrowing the gap between
autoregressive and flow-based generation paradigms.

Conclusion: STRL为复杂现实决策场景提供了一种高效、低成本的生物启发机器学习模型。

Abstract: Agent-based Transformers have been widely adopted in recent reinforcement
learning advances due to their demonstrated ability to solve complex tasks.
However, the high computational complexity of Transformers often results in
significant energy consumption, limiting their deployment in real-world
autonomous systems. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), with their biologically
inspired structure, offer an energy-efficient alternative for machine learning.
In this paper, a novel Spike-Transformer Reinforcement Learning (STRL)
algorithm that combines the energy efficiency of SNNs with the powerful
decision-making capabilities of reinforcement learning is developed.
Specifically, an SNN using multi-step Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons
and attention mechanisms capable of processing spatio-temporal patterns over
multiple time steps is designed. The architecture is further enhanced with
state, action, and reward encodings to create a Transformer-like structure
optimized for reinforcement learning tasks. Comprehensive numerical experiments
conducted on state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed SNN
Transformer achieves significantly improved policy performance compared to
conventional agent-based Transformers. With both enhanced energy efficiency and
policy optimality, this work highlights a promising direction for deploying
bio-inspired, low-cost machine learning models in complex real-world
decision-making scenarios.

Abstract: Huawei Cloud users leverage LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) as an efficient and
scalable method to fine-tune and customize large language models (LLMs) for
application-specific needs. However, tasks that require complex reasoning or
deep contextual understanding are often hindered by biases or interference from
the base model when using typical decoding methods like greedy or beam search.
These biases can lead to generic or task-agnostic responses from the base model
instead of leveraging the LoRA-specific adaptations. In this paper, we
introduce Contrastive LoRA Decoding (CoLD), a novel decoding framework designed
to maximize the use of task-specific knowledge in LoRA-adapted models,
resulting in better downstream performance. CoLD uses contrastive decoding by
scoring candidate tokens based on the divergence between the probability
distributions of a LoRA-adapted expert model and the corresponding base model.
This approach prioritizes tokens that better align with the LoRA's learned
representations, enhancing performance for specialized tasks. While effective,
a naive implementation of CoLD is computationally expensive because each
decoding step requires evaluating multiple token candidates across both models.
To address this, we developed an optimized kernel for Huawei's Ascend NPU. CoLD
achieves up to a 5.54% increase in task accuracy while reducing end-to-end
latency by 28% compared to greedy decoding. This work provides practical and
efficient decoding strategies for fine-tuned LLMs in resource-constrained
environments and has broad implications for applied data science in both cloud
and on-premises settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by optimizing their
policies with reward signals. Yet, RL's success relies on the reliability of
rewards, which are provided by verifiers. In this paper, we expose and analyze
a widespread problem--false negatives--where verifiers wrongly reject correct
model outputs. Our in-depth study of the Big-Math-RL-Verified dataset reveals
that over 38% of model-generated responses suffer from false negatives, where
the verifier fails to recognize correct answers. We show, both empirically and
theoretically, that these false negatives severely impair RL training by
depriving the model of informative gradient signals and slowing convergence. To
mitigate this, we propose tinyV, a lightweight LLM-based verifier that augments
existing rule-based methods, which dynamically identifies potential false
negatives and recovers valid responses to produce more accurate reward
estimates. Across multiple math-reasoning benchmarks, integrating TinyV boosts
pass rates by up to 10% and accelerates convergence relative to the baseline.
Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing verifier false
negatives and offer a practical approach to improve RL-based fine-tuning of
LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/uw-nsl/TinyV.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has been paralleled by
unprecedented increases in computational demands, with training costs for
state-of-the-art models doubling every few months. Training models directly in
low-precision arithmetic offers a solution, by improving both computational
throughput and energy efficiency. Specifically, NVIDIA's recent Blackwell
architecture facilitates extremely low-precision operations, specifically FP4
variants, promising substantial efficiency gains. Yet, current algorithms for
training LLMs in FP4 precision face significant accuracy degradation and often
rely on mixed-precision fallbacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate
hardware-supported FP4 training and introduce Quartet, a new approach enabling
accurate, end-to-end FP4 training with all the major computations (in e.g.
linear layers) being performed in low precision. Through extensive evaluations
on Llama-type models, we reveal a new low-precision scaling law that quantifies
performance trade-offs across varying bit-widths and allows us to identify a
"near-optimal" low-precision training technique in terms of
accuracy-vs-computation, called Quartet. We implement Quartet using optimized
CUDA kernels tailored for NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, and show that it can achieve
state-of-the-art accuracy for FP4 precision, successfully training
billion-scale models. Our method demonstrates that fully FP4-based training is
a competitive alternative to standard-precision and FP8 training. Our code is

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of pre-trained large language models (LLMs),
recent endeavors have leveraged the capabilities of LLMs in relevance modeling,
resulting in enhanced performance. This is usually done through the process of
fine-tuning LLMs on specifically annotated datasets to determine the relevance
between queries and items. However, there are two limitations when LLMs are
naively employed for relevance modeling through fine-tuning and inference.
First, it is not inherently efficient for performing nuanced tasks beyond
simple yes or no answers, such as assessing search relevance. It may therefore
tend to be overconfident and struggle to distinguish fine-grained degrees of
relevance (e.g., strong relevance, weak relevance, irrelevance) used in search
engines. Second, it exhibits significant performance degradation when
confronted with data distribution shift in real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel Distribution-Aware Robust Learning framework (DaRL) for
relevance modeling in Alipay Search. Specifically, we design an effective loss
function to enhance the discriminability of LLM-based relevance modeling across
various fine-grained degrees of query-item relevance. To improve the
generalizability of LLM-based relevance modeling, we first propose the
Distribution-Aware Sample Augmentation (DASA) module. This module utilizes
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection techniques to actively select appropriate
samples that are not well covered by the original training set for model
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-stage fine-tuning strategy to
simultaneously improve in-distribution (ID) and OOD performance, bridging the
performance gap between them. DaRL has been deployed online to serve the

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show human-level performance and their
specialized descendants, code generation models, play core roles in solving
complex tasks, including mathematical reasoning and software development. On
the downside, the hallucination of LLMs mainly hinders their applicability to
systems requiring higher safety standards, thus drawing the attention of the AI
community. However, the hallucination of code generation models is rarely
considered. One critical bottleneck in considering code hallucination is the
intricate property of code to identify whether generated code has the intended
functionality due to its un-natural form, different to natural languages.
Handful of unit tests have been considered to address this issue, but
scaling-up its size is extremely expensive. We address this core bottleneck by
automatically generating unit tests using dynamic code analysis tools, which
leverages the \emph{executable nature} of code. Given generated unit tests from
true code for measuring functional correctness of generated code, we propose to
learn a \emph{selective code generator}, which abstains from answering for
unsure generation, to control the rate of code hallucination among
non-abstaining answers in terms of a false discovery rate. This learning
algorithm provides a controllability guarantee, providing trustworthiness of
code generation. Finally, we propose to use generated unit tests in evaluation
as well as in learning for precise code evaluation, calling this evaluation
paradigm \emph{FuzzEval}. We demonstrate the efficacy of our selective code
generator over open and closed code generators, showing clear benefit of
leveraging generated unit tests along with the controllability of code
hallucination and reasonable selection efficiency via our selective code
generator.

Abstract: In recent years, model collapse has become a critical issue in language model
training, making it essential to understand the underlying mechanisms driving
this phenomenon. In this paper, we investigate recursive parametric model
training from a probabilistic perspective, aiming to characterize the
conditions under which model collapse occurs and, crucially, how it can be
mitigated. We conceptualize the recursive training process as a random walk of
the model estimate, highlighting how the sample size influences the step size
and how the estimation procedure determines the direction and potential bias of
the random walk. Under mild conditions, we rigorously show that progressively
increasing the sample size at each training step is necessary to prevent model
collapse. In particular, when the estimation is unbiased, the required growth
rate follows a superlinear pattern. This rate needs to be accelerated even
further in the presence of substantial estimation bias. Building on this
probabilistic framework, we also investigate the probability that recursive
training on synthetic data yields models that outperform those trained solely
on real data. Moreover, we extend these results to general parametric model
family in an asymptotic regime. Finally, we validate our theoretical results
through extensive simulations and a real-world dataset.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms, particularly within Transformer architectures and large

learning and artificial intelligence applications. To compute attention for
increasingly long sequences, specialized accelerators have been proposed to
execute key attention steps directly in hardware. Among the various recently
proposed architectures, those based on variants of the FlashAttention
algorithm, originally designed for GPUs, stand out due to their optimized
computation, tiling capabilities, and reduced memory traffic. In this work, we
focus on optimizing the kernel of floating-point-based FlashAttention using new
hardware operators that fuse the computation of exponentials and vector
multiplications, e.g., e^x, V. The proposed ExpMul hardware operators
significantly reduce the area and power costs of FlashAttention-based hardware

Conclusion: 研究表明，自上而下的调制在平衡稳定性和可塑性中起关键作用。

Abstract: Biological brains learn continually from a stream of unlabeled data, while
integrating specialized information from sparsely labeled examples without
compromising their ability to generalize. Meanwhile, machine learning methods
are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in this natural learning setting, as
supervised specialist fine-tuning degrades performance on the original task. We
introduce task-modulated contrastive learning (TMCL), which takes inspiration
from the biophysical machinery in the neocortex, using predictive coding
principles to integrate top-down information continually and without
supervision. We follow the idea that these principles build a view-invariant
representation space, and that this can be implemented using a contrastive
loss. Then, whenever labeled samples of a new class occur, new affine
modulations are learned that improve separation of the new class from all
others, without affecting feedforward weights. By co-opting the view-invariance
learning mechanism, we then train feedforward weights to match the unmodulated
representation of a data sample to its modulated counterparts. This introduces
modulation invariance into the representation space, and, by also using past
modulations, stabilizes it. Our experiments show improvements in both
class-incremental and transfer learning over state-of-the-art unsupervised
approaches, as well as over comparable supervised approaches, using as few as
1% of available labels. Taken together, our work suggests that top-down
modulations play a crucial role in balancing stability and plasticity.

Conclusion: ServerlessLoRA显著提升了LoRA LLM推理的效率和成本效益。

Abstract: Serverless computing has grown rapidly for serving Large Language Model (LLM)
inference due to its pay-as-you-go pricing, fine-grained GPU usage, and rapid
scaling. However, our analysis reveals that current serverless can effectively
serve general LLM but fail with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) inference due to
three key limitations: 1) massive parameter redundancy among functions where
99% of weights are unnecessarily duplicated, 2) costly artifact loading latency
beyond LLM loading, and 3) magnified resource contention when serving multiple
LoRA LLMs. These inefficiencies lead to massive GPU wastage, increased
Time-To-First-Token (TTFT), and high monetary costs.
  We propose ServerlessLoRA, a novel serverless inference system designed for
faster and cheaper LoRA LLM serving. ServerlessLoRA enables secure backbone LLM
sharing across isolated LoRA functions to reduce redundancy. We design a
pre-loading method that pre-loads comprehensive LoRA artifacts to minimize
cold-start latency. Furthermore, ServerlessLoRA employs contention aware
batching and offloading to mitigate GPU resource conflicts during bursty
workloads. Experiment on industrial workloads demonstrates that ServerlessLoRA
reduces TTFT by up to 86% and cuts monetary costs by up to 89% compared to
state-of-the-art LLM inference solutions.

Conclusion: LN层能显著提升神经网络在训练分布外数据上的稳定性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In spite of their prevalence, the behaviour of Neural Networks when
extrapolating far from the training distribution remains poorly understood,
with existing results limited to specific cases. In this work, we prove general
results -- the first of their kind -- by applying Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
theory to analyse infinitely-wide neural networks trained until convergence and
prove that the inclusion of just one Layer Norm (LN) fundamentally alters the
induced NTK, transforming it into a bounded-variance kernel. As a result, the
output of an infinitely wide network with at least one LN remains bounded, even
on inputs far from the training data. In contrast, we show that a broad class
of networks without LN can produce pathologically large outputs for certain
inputs. We support these theoretical findings with empirical experiments on
finite-width networks, demonstrating that while standard NNs often exhibit
uncontrolled growth outside the training domain, a single LN layer effectively
mitigates this instability. Finally, we explore real-world implications of this
extrapolatory stability, including applications to predicting residue sizes in
proteins larger than those seen during training and estimating age from facial
images of underrepresented ethnicities absent from the training set.

Abstract: This paper reviews the topological groundwork for the study of reinforcement

We begin by recalling key mathematical concepts such as complete metric spaces,
which form the foundation for expressing RL problems. By leveraging the Banach
contraction principle, we illustrate how the Banach fixed-point theorem
explains the convergence of RL algorithms and how Bellman operators, expressed
as operators on Banach spaces, ensure this convergence. The work serves as a
bridge between theoretical mathematics and practical algorithm design, offering
new approaches to enhance the efficiency of RL. In particular, we investigate
alternative formulations of Bellman operators and demonstrate their impact on
improving convergence rates and performance in standard RL environments such as
MountainCar, CartPole, and Acrobot. Our findings highlight how a deeper
mathematical understanding of RL can lead to more effective algorithms for
decision-making problems.

Conclusion: KIPPO通过线性化潜在空间表示，显著提升了PPO的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made significant strides in various domains,
and policy gradient methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have gained
popularity due to their balance in performance, training stability, and
computational efficiency. These methods directly optimize policies through
gradient-based updates. However, developing effective control policies for
environments with complex and non-linear dynamics remains a challenge. High
variance in gradient estimates and non-convex optimization landscapes often
lead to unstable learning trajectories. Koopman Operator Theory has emerged as
a powerful framework for studying non-linear systems through an
infinite-dimensional linear operator that acts on a higher-dimensional space of
measurement functions. In contrast with their non-linear counterparts, linear
systems are simpler, more predictable, and easier to analyze. In this paper, we
present Koopman-Inspired Proximal Policy Optimization (KIPPO), which learns an
approximately linear latent-space representation of the underlying system's
dynamics while retaining essential features for effective policy learning. This
is achieved through a Koopman-approximation auxiliary network that can be added
to the baseline policy optimization algorithms without altering the
architecture of the core policy or value function. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate consistent improvements over the PPO baseline with 6-60%
increased performance while reducing variability by up to 91% when evaluated on
various continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: 后修补防御是一种高效且实用的方法，显著改善了SLMs的安全性。

Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) enable natural interactions via spoken
instructions, which more effectively capture user intent by detecting nuances
in speech. The richer speech signal introduces new security risks compared to
text-based models, as adversaries can better bypass safety mechanisms by
injecting imperceptible noise to speech. We analyze adversarial attacks and
find that SLMs are substantially more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which
can achieve a perfect 100% attack success rate in some instances. To improve
security, we propose post-hoc patching defenses used to intervene during
inference by modifying the SLM's activations that improve robustness up to 99%
with (i) negligible impact on utility and (ii) without any re-training. We
conduct ablation studies to maximize the efficacy of our defenses and improve
the utility/security trade-off, validated with large-scale benchmarks unique to
SLMs.

Conclusion: 结论指出，在训练数据保护至关重要时，使用迁移学习分类器存在显著风险。

Abstract: Training data reconstruction attacks enable adversaries to recover portions
of a released model's training data. We consider the attacks where a
reconstructor neural network learns to invert the (random) mapping between
training data and model weights. Prior work has shown that an informed
adversary with access to released model's weights and all but one training data
point can achieve high-quality reconstructions in this way. However,
differential privacy can defend against such an attack with little to no loss
in model's utility when the amount of training data is sufficiently large. In
this work we consider a more realistic adversary who only knows the
distribution from which a small training dataset has been sampled and who
attacks a transfer-learned neural network classifier that has been trained on
this dataset. We exhibit an attack that works in this realistic threat model
and demonstrate that in the small-data regime it cannot be defended against by
DP-SGD without severely damaging the classifier accuracy. This raises
significant concerns about the use of such transfer-learned classifiers when
protection of training-data is paramount. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of our attack on VGG, EfficientNet and ResNet image classifiers
transfer-learned on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA respectively. Additionally, we
point out that the commonly used (true-positive) reconstruction success rate
metric fails to reliably quantify the actual reconstruction effectiveness.
Instead, we make use of the Neyman-Pearson lemma to construct the receiver
operating characteristic curve and consider the associated true-positive
reconstruction rate at a fixed level of the false-positive reconstruction rate.

Result: FlashKAT实现了86.5倍的训练速度提升，并减少了系数梯度的舍入误差。

Conclusion: FlashKAT有效解决了KAT的性能瓶颈，为其在大规模任务中的应用提供了可能。

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has been gaining popularity as an
alternative to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with its increased
expressiveness and interpretability. However, the KAN can be orders of
magnitude slower due to its increased computational cost and training
instability, limiting its applicability to larger-scale tasks. Recently, the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT) has been proposed, which can achieve FLOPs
similar to the traditional Transformer with MLPs by leveraging Group-Rational
KAN (GR-KAN). Unfortunately, despite the comparable FLOPs, our
characterizations reveal that the KAT is still 123x slower in training speeds,
indicating that there are other performance bottlenecks beyond FLOPs. In this
paper, we conduct a series of experiments to understand the root cause of the
slowdown in KAT. We uncover that the slowdown can be isolated to memory stalls
and, more specifically, in the backward pass of GR-KAN caused by inefficient
gradient accumulation. To address this memory bottleneck, we propose FlashKAT,
which builds on our restructured kernel that minimizes gradient accumulation
with atomic adds and accesses to slow memory. Evaluations demonstrate that
FlashKAT can achieve a training speedup of 86.5x compared with the
state-of-the-art KAT, while reducing rounding errors in the coefficient
gradients. Our code is available at https://github.com/OSU-STARLAB/FlashKAT.

Abstract: Numerous works have noted significant similarities in how machine learning
models represent the world, even across modalities. Although much effort has
been devoted to uncovering properties and metrics on which these models align,
surprisingly little work has explored causes of this similarity. To advance
this line of inquiry, this work explores how two possible causal factors --
dataset overlap and task overlap -- influence downstream model similarity. The
exploration of dataset overlap is motivated by the reality that large-scale
generative AI models are often trained on overlapping datasets of scraped
internet data, while the exploration of task overlap seeks to substantiate
claims from a recent work, the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, that task
similarity may drive model similarity. We evaluate the effects of both factors
through a broad set of experiments. We find that both positively correlate with
higher representational similarity and that combining them provides the
strongest effect. Our code and dataset are published.

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks learn remains a fundamental challenge
in modern machine learning. A growing body of evidence suggests that training
dynamics undergo a distinct phase transition, yet our understanding of this
transition is still incomplete. In this paper, we introduce an interval-wise
perspective that compares network states across a time window, revealing two
new phenomena that illuminate the two-phase nature of deep learning. i)
\textbf{The Chaos Effect.} By injecting an imperceptibly small parameter
perturbation at various stages, we show that the response of the network to the
perturbation exhibits a transition from chaotic to stable, suggesting there is
an early critical period where the network is highly sensitive to initial
conditions; ii) \textbf{The Cone Effect.} Tracking the evolution of the
empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (eNTK), we find that after this transition
point the model's functional trajectory is confined to a narrow cone-shaped
subset: while the kernel continues to change, it gets trapped into a tight
angular region. Together, these effects provide a structural, dynamical view of
how deep networks transition from sensitive exploration to stable refinement
during training.

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，该方法能有效提升模型对虚假偏差的鲁棒性，适用于多种数据集。

Conclusion: ShortcutProbe是一种高效且实用的工具，无需组标签即可改善模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning models often achieve high performance by inadvertently learning
spurious correlations between targets and non-essential features. For example,
an image classifier may identify an object via its background that spuriously
correlates with it. This prediction behavior, known as spurious bias, severely
degrades model performance on data that lacks the learned spurious
correlations. Existing methods on spurious bias mitigation typically require a
variety of data groups with spurious correlation annotations called group
labels. However, group labels require costly human annotations and often fail
to capture subtle spurious biases such as relying on specific pixels for
predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel post hoc spurious bias
mitigation framework without requiring group labels. Our framework, termed
ShortcutProbe, identifies prediction shortcuts that reflect potential
non-robustness in predictions in a given model's latent space. The model is
then retrained to be invariant to the identified prediction shortcuts for
improved robustness. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of the
framework and empirically demonstrate that it is an efficient and practical
tool for improving a model's robustness to spurious bias on diverse datasets.

Abstract: We say that a classifier is \emph{adversarially robust} to perturbations of
norm $r$ if, with high probability over a point $x$ drawn from the input
distribution, there is no point within distance $\le r$ from $x$ that is
classified differently. The \emph{boundary volume} is the probability that a
point falls within distance $r$ of a point with a different label. This work
studies the task of computationally efficient learning of hypotheses with small
boundary volume, where the input is distributed as a subgaussian isotropic
log-concave distribution over $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  Linear threshold functions are adversarially robust; they have boundary
volume proportional to $r$. Such concept classes are efficiently learnable by
polynomial regression, which produces a polynomial threshold function (PTF),
but PTFs in general may have boundary volume $\Omega(1)$, even for $r \ll 1$.
  We give an algorithm that agnostically learns linear threshold functions and
returns a classifier with boundary volume $O(r+\varepsilon)$ at radius of
perturbation $r$. The time and sample complexity of
$d^{\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ matches the complexity of polynomial
regression.
  Our algorithm augments the classic approach of polynomial regression with
three additional steps: a) performing the $\ell_1$-error regression under noise
sensitivity constraints, b) a structured partitioning and rounding step that
returns a Boolean classifier with error $\textsf{opt} + O(\varepsilon)$ and
noise sensitivity $O(r+\varepsilon)$ simultaneously, and c) a local corrector
that ``smooths'' a function with low noise sensitivity into a function that is
adversarially robust.

Abstract: Understanding how deep learning models represent data is currently difficult
due to the limited number of methodologies available. This paper demonstrates a
versatile and novel visualisation tool for determining the axis alignment of
embedded data at any layer in any deep learning model. In particular, it
evaluates the distribution around planes defined by the network's privileged
basis vectors. This method provides both an atomistic and a holistic, intuitive
metric for interpreting the distribution of activations across all planes. It
ensures that both positive and negative signals contribute, treating the
activation vector as a whole. Depending on the application, several variations
of this technique are presented, with a resolution scale hyperparameter to
probe different angular scales. Using this method, multiple examples are
provided that demonstrate embedded representations tend to be axis-aligned with
the privileged basis. This is not necessarily the standard basis, and it is
found that activation functions directly result in privileged bases. Hence, it
provides a direct causal link between functional form symmetry breaking and
representational alignment, explaining why representations have a tendency to
align with the neuron basis. Therefore, using this method, we begin to answer
the fundamental question of what causes the observed tendency of
representations to align with neurons. Finally, examples of so-called
grandmother neurons are found in a variety of networks.

Abstract: Though neural networks trained on large data sets have been successfully used
to describe and predict many physical phenomena, there is a sense among
scientists that, unlike traditional scientific models, where relationships come
packaged in the form of simple mathematical expressions, the findings of the
neural network cannot be integrated into the body of scientific knowledge.
Critics of ML's inability to produce human-understandable relationships have
converged on the concept of "interpretability" as its point of departure from
more traditional forms of science. As the growing interest in interpretability
has shown, researchers in the physical sciences seek not just predictive
models, but also to uncover the fundamental principles that govern a system of
interest. However, clarity around a definition of interpretability and the
precise role that it plays in science is lacking in the literature. In this
work, we argue that researchers in equation discovery and symbolic regression
tend to conflate the concept of sparsity with interpretability. We review key
papers on interpretable ML from outside the scientific community and argue
that, though the definitions and methods they propose can inform questions of
interpretability for SciML, they are inadequate for this new purpose. Noting
these deficiencies, we propose an operational definition of interpretability
for the physical sciences. Our notion of interpretability emphasizes
understanding of the mechanism over mathematical sparsity. Innocuous though it
may seem, this emphasis on mechanism shows that sparsity is often unnecessary.
It also questions the possibility of interpretable scientific discovery when
prior knowledge is lacking. We believe a precise and philosophically informed
definition of interpretability in SciML will help focus research efforts toward
the most significant obstacles to realizing a data-driven scientific future.

Motivation: 探索预训练基础模型在零样本时间序列预测中的潜力，特别是在死亡率预测任务中的应用，以减少对任务特定微调的依赖。

Method: 使用TimesFM和CHRONOS两种预训练基础模型，与传统方法（如ARIMA和Lee-Carter模型）以及机器学习方法（如随机森林）进行比较，评估其在5年、10年和20年三个预测时间范围内的表现。

Result: CHRONOS在短期预测中表现优于传统方法，而TimesFM表现不佳。微调CHRONOS显著提升了长期预测准确性，但随机森林模型整体表现最佳。

Conclusion: 零样本预测具有潜力，但需谨慎选择模型并进行领域特定适配。

Abstract: This study explores the potential of zero-shot time series forecasting, an
innovative approach leveraging pre-trained foundation models, to forecast
mortality rates without task-specific fine-tuning. We evaluate two
state-of-the-art foundation models, TimesFM and CHRONOS, alongside traditional
and machine learning-based methods across three forecasting horizons (5, 10,
and 20 years) using data from 50 countries and 111 age groups. In our
investigations, zero-shot models showed varying results: while CHRONOS
delivered competitive shorter-term forecasts, outperforming traditional methods
like ARIMA and the Lee-Carter model, TimesFM consistently underperformed.
Fine-tuning CHRONOS on mortality data significantly improved long-term
accuracy. A Random Forest model, trained on mortality data, achieved the best
overall performance. These findings underscore the potential of zero-shot
forecasting while highlighting the need for careful model selection and
domain-specific adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过Zero-Shot NAS自动剪枝搜索空间的方法，显著降低One-Shot NAS的内存消耗和搜索时间，同时保持搜索精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决One-Shot NAS方法（如DARTS）在搜索过程中GPU内存需求高的问题。

Method: 先利用Zero-Shot NAS高效移除低性能架构，再在剪枝后的搜索空间应用One-Shot NAS。

Result: 在DARTS搜索空间上，内存消耗减少81%，同时保持相同精度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了搜索效率和精度。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a powerful tool for automating
architecture design. One-Shot NAS techniques, such as DARTS, have gained
substantial popularity due to their combination of search efficiency with
simplicity of implementation. By design, One-Shot methods have high GPU memory
requirements during the search. To mitigate this issue, we propose to prune the
search space in an efficient automatic manner to reduce memory consumption and
search time while preserving the search accuracy. Specifically, we utilise
Zero-Shot NAS to efficiently remove low-performing architectures from the
search space before applying One-Shot NAS to the pruned search space.
Experimental results on the DARTS search space show that our approach reduces
memory consumption by 81% compared to the baseline One-Shot setup while
achieving the same level of accuracy.

Motivation: 现代深度神经网络的参数空间具有高维性，其Fisher信息度量张量对理论和实践方法至关重要。然而，直接估计该张量具有挑战性，因此需要高效且可靠的方法。

Method: 通过分析分类网络的核心空间（低维概率分布空间）的黎曼度量谱，将结果扩展到neuromanifold上的度量张量确定性边界。提出了一种基于Hutchinson迹估计器的无偏随机估计方法，可通过单次反向传播高效计算张量及其边界。

Conclusion: 该方法为深度学习中Fisher信息度量张量的高效估计提供了理论支持，并具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The high dimensional parameter space of modern deep neural networks -- the
neuromanifold -- is endowed with a unique metric tensor defined by the Fisher
information, estimating which is crucial for both theory and practical methods
in deep learning. To analyze this tensor for classification networks, we return
to a low dimensional space of probability distributions -- the core space --
and carefully analyze the spectrum of its Riemannian metric. We extend our
discoveries there into deterministic bounds of the metric tensor on the
neuromanifold. We introduce an unbiased random estimate of the metric tensor
and its bounds based on Hutchinson's trace estimator. It can be evaluated
efficiently through a single backward pass and can be used to estimate the
diagonal, or block diagonal, or the full tensor. Its quality is guaranteed with
a standard deviation bounded by the true value up to scaling.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了离线模型强化学习的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for
data-driven control. Compared to model-free approaches, offline model-based RL
(MBRL) explicitly learns a world model from a static dataset and uses it as a
surrogate simulator, improving data efficiency and enabling potential
generalization beyond the dataset support. However, most existing offline MBRL
methods follow a two-stage training procedure: first learning a world model by
maximizing the likelihood of the observed transitions, then optimizing a policy
to maximize its expected return under the learned model. This objective
mismatch results in a world model that is not necessarily optimized for
effective policy learning. Moreover, we observe that policies learned via
offline MBRL often lack robustness during deployment, and small adversarial
noise in the environment can lead to significant performance degradation. To
address these, we propose a framework that dynamically adapts the world model
alongside the policy under a unified learning objective aimed at improving
robustness. At the core of our method is a maximin optimization problem, which
we solve by innovatively utilizing Stackelberg learning dynamics. We provide
theoretical analysis to support our design and introduce computationally
efficient implementations. We benchmark our algorithm on twelve noisy D4RL
MuJoCo tasks and three stochastic Tokamak Control tasks, demonstrating its
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: VAMO为计算受限场景提供了一种高效且灵活的优化方案。

Abstract: Optimizing large-scale nonconvex problems, common in machine learning,
demands balancing rapid convergence with computational efficiency. First-order
(FO) stochastic methods like SVRG provide fast convergence and good
generalization but incur high costs due to full-batch gradients in large
models. Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) algorithms reduce this burden using
estimated gradients, yet their slow convergence in high-dimensional settings
limits practicality. We introduce VAMO (VAriance-reduced Mixed-gradient
Optimizer), a stochastic variance-reduced method combining FO mini-batch
gradients with lightweight ZO finite-difference probes under an SVRG-style
framework. VAMO's hybrid design uses a two-point ZO estimator to achieve a
dimension-agnostic convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T + 1/b)$, where $T$ is
the number of iterations and $b$ is the batch-size, surpassing the
dimension-dependent slowdown of purely ZO methods and significantly improving
over SGD's $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate. Additionally, we propose a
multi-point ZO variant that mitigates the $O(1/b)$ error by adjusting number of
estimation points to balance convergence and cost, making it ideal for a whole
range of computationally constrained scenarios. Experiments including
traditional neural network training and LLM finetuning show VAMO outperforms
established FO and ZO methods, offering a faster, more flexible option for

Abstract: Existing research on judicial sentencing prediction predominantly relies on

interpretability-a critical requirement for both scholarly research and
judicial practice. To address this challenge, we make three key
contributions:First, we propose a novel Saturated Mechanistic Sentencing (SMS)
model, which provides inherent legal interpretability by virtue of its
foundation in China's Criminal Law. We also introduce the corresponding
Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) adaptive algorithm for this model. Second,
for the MLMS algorithm based adaptive sentencing predictor, we establish a
mathematical theory on the accuracy of adaptive prediction without resorting to
any stationarity and independence assumptions on the data. We also provide a
best possible upper bound for the prediction accuracy achievable by the best
predictor designed in the known parameters case. Third, we construct a Chinese
Intentional Bodily Harm (CIBH) dataset. Utilizing this real-world data,
extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a prediction
accuracy that is not far from the best possible theoretical upper bound,

Abstract: This paper pioneers a novel data-centric paradigm to maximize the utility of

Abstract: The use of guidance to steer sampling toward desired outcomes has been widely
explored within diffusion models, especially in applications such as image and
trajectory generation. However, incorporating guidance during training remains
relatively underexplored. In this work, we introduce energy-guided flow
matching, a novel approach that enhances the training of flow models and
eliminates the need for guidance at inference time. We learn a conditional
velocity field corresponding to the flow policy by approximating an
energy-guided probability path as a Gaussian path. Learning guided trajectories
is appealing for tasks where the target distribution is defined by a
combination of data and an energy function, as in reinforcement learning.
Diffusion-based policies have recently attracted attention for their expressive
power and ability to capture multi-modal action distributions. Typically, these
policies are optimized using weighted objectives or by back-propagating
gradients through actions sampled by the policy. As an alternative, we propose
FlowQ, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm based on energy-guided flow
matching. Our method achieves competitive performance while the policy training
time is constant in the number of flow sampling steps.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks exhibit heterogeneity across numerous layers of
various types such as residuals, multi-head attention, etc., due to varying
structures (dimensions, activation functions, etc.), distinct representation
characteristics, which impact predictions. We develop a general layer-wise
quantization framework with tight variance and code-length bounds, adapting to
the heterogeneities over the course of training. We then apply a new layer-wise
quantization technique within distributed variational inequalities (VIs),
proposing a novel Quantized Optimistic Dual Averaging (QODA) algorithm with
adaptive learning rates, which achieves competitive convergence rates for

Abstract: Table foundation models bring high hopes to data science: pre-trained on
tabular data to embark knowledge or priors, they should facilitate downstream
tasks on tables. One specific challenge is that of data semantics: numerical
entries take their meaning from context, e.g., column name. Pre-trained neural
networks that jointly model column names and table entries have recently
boosted prediction accuracy. While these models outline the promises of world
knowledge to interpret table values, they lack the convenience of popular
foundation models in text or vision. Indeed, they must be fine-tuned to bring
benefits, come with sizeable computation costs, and cannot easily be reused or
combined with other architectures. Here we introduce TARTE, a foundation model
that transforms tables to knowledge-enhanced vector representations using the
string to capture semantics. Pre-trained on large relational data, TARTE yields
representations that facilitate subsequent learning with little additional
cost. These representations can be fine-tuned or combined with other learners,
giving models that push the state-of-the-art prediction performance and improve
the prediction/computation performance trade-off. Specialized to a task or a
domain, TARTE gives domain-specific representations that facilitate further
learning. Our study demonstrates an effective approach to knowledge
pre-training for tabular learning.

Abstract: Aiming at resisting backdoor attacks in convolution neural networks and
vision Transformer-based large model, this paper proposes a generalized and
model-agnostic trigger-purification approach resorting to the classic Ising
model. To date, existing trigger detection/removal studies usually require to
know the detailed knowledge of target model in advance, access to a large
number of clean samples or even model-retraining authorization, which brings
the huge inconvenience for practical applications, especially inaccessible to
target model. An ideal countermeasure ought to eliminate the implanted trigger
without regarding whatever the target models are. To this end, a lightweight

memorization-association functionality of Hopfield network, by which the
triggers of input samples can be effectively purified in a proper manner. The

Abstract: Algorithmic bias has been the subject of much recent controversy. To clarify
what is at stake and to make progress resolving the controversy, a better
understanding of the concepts involved would be helpful. The discussion here
focuses on the disputed claim that algorithms themselves cannot be biased. To
clarify this claim we need to know what kind of thing 'algorithms themselves'
are, and to disambiguate the several meanings of 'bias' at play. This further
involves showing how bias of moral import can result from statistical biases,
and drawing connections to previous conceptual work about political artifacts
and oppressive things. Data bias has been identified in domains like hiring,
policing and medicine. Examples where algorithms themselves have been
pinpointed as the locus of bias include recommender systems that influence
media consumption, academic search engines that influence citation patterns,
and the 2020 UK algorithmically-moderated A-level grades. Recognition that
algorithms are a kind of thing that can be biased is key to making decisions

Abstract: Noise contrastive estimation (NCE) is a popular method for training
energy-based models (EBM) with intractable normalisation terms. The key idea of
NCE is to learn by comparing unnormalised log-likelihoods of the reference and
noisy samples, thus avoiding explicitly computing normalisation terms. However,
NCE critically relies on the quality of noisy samples. Recently, sliced score
matching (SSM) has been popularised by closely related diffusion models (DM).
Unlike NCE, SSM learns a gradient of log-likelihood, or score, by learning
distribution of its projections on randomly chosen directions. However, both
NCE and SSM disregard the form of log-likelihood function, which is problematic
given that EBMs and DMs make use of first-order optimisation during inference.
This paper proposes a new criterion that learns scores more suitable for
first-order schemes. Experiments contrasts these approaches for training EBMs.

Method: 将MCTM与自回归NF结合，先利用MCTM建模边际分布的可解释特征效应，再用NF处理联合分布中的非线性关系。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上的实验表明，该方法优于单独的MCTM和NF模型。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了可解释性和灵活性，适用于复杂多变量分布建模。

Abstract: Density regression models allow a comprehensive understanding of data by
modeling the complete conditional probability distribution. While flexible
estimation approaches such as normalizing flows (NF) work particularly well in
multiple dimensions, interpreting the input-output relationship of such models
is often difficult, due to the black-box character of deep learning models. In
contrast, existing statistical methods for multivariate outcomes such as
multivariate conditional transformation models (MCTM) are restricted in
flexibility and are often not expressive enough to represent complex
multivariate probability distributions. In this paper, we combine MCTM with
state-of-the-art and autoregressive NF to leverage the transparency of MCTM for
modeling interpretable feature effects on the marginal distributions in the
first step and the flexibility of neural-network-based NF techniques to account
for complex and non-linear relationships in the joint data distribution. We
demonstrate our method's versatility in various numerical experiments and
compare it with MCTM and other NF models on both simulated and real-world data.

Abstract: In the era of foundation models and Large Language Models (LLMs), Euclidean
space is the de facto geometric setting of our machine learning architectures.
However, recent literature has demonstrated that this choice comes with
fundamental limitations. To that end, non-Euclidean learning is quickly gaining
traction, particularly in web-related applications where complex relationships
and structures are prevalent. Non-Euclidean spaces, such as hyperbolic,
spherical, and mixed-curvature spaces, have been shown to provide more
efficient and effective representations for data with intrinsic geometric
properties, including web-related data like social network topology,
query-document relationships, and user-item interactions. Integrating
foundation models with non-Euclidean geometries has great potential to enhance
their ability to capture and model the underlying structures, leading to better
performance in search, recommendations, and content understanding. This
workshop focuses on the intersection of Non-Euclidean Foundation Models and
Geometric Learning (NEGEL), exploring its potential benefits, including the
potential benefits for advancing web-related technologies, challenges, and
future directions. Workshop page:

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) confronts the dual challenge of aligning
known-class distributions across domains while identifying
target-domain-specific unknown categories. Current approaches often fail to
leverage semantic relationships between modalities and struggle with error
accumulation in unknown sample detection. We propose to harness Contrastive
Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) to address these limitations through two key
innovations: 1) Prompt-driven cross-domain alignment: Learnable textual prompts
conditioned on domain discrepancy metrics dynamically adapt CLIP's text
encoder, enabling semantic consistency between source and target domains
without explicit unknown-class supervision. 2) Gradient-aware open-set
separation: A gradient analysis module quantifies domain shift by comparing the
L2-norm of gradients from the learned prompts, where known/unknown samples
exhibit statistically distinct gradient behaviors. Evaluations on Office-Home
show that our method consistently outperforms CLIP baseline and standard
baseline. Ablation studies confirm the gradient norm's critical role.

Conclusion: 动态环境中的DFL问题可以通过正则化和乐观原则有效解决，为复杂决策问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) is an increasingly popular paradigm for
training predictive models whose outputs are used in decision-making tasks.
Instead of merely optimizing for predictive accuracy, DFL trains models to
directly minimize the loss associated with downstream decisions. This
end-to-end strategy holds promise for tackling complex combinatorial problems;
however, existing studies focus solely on scenarios where a fixed batch of data
is available and the objective function does not change over time. We instead
investigate DFL in dynamic environments where the objective function and data
distribution evolve over time. This setting is challenging because the
objective function has zero or undefined gradients -- which prevents the use of
standard first-order optimization methods -- and is generally non-convex. To
address these difficulties, we (i) regularize the objective to make it
differentiable and (ii) make use of the optimism principle, based on a
near-optimal oracle along with an appropriate perturbation. This leads to a
practical online algorithm for which we establish bounds on the expected
dynamic regret, both when the decision space is a simplex and when it is a
general bounded convex polytope. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
our algorithm by comparing its performance with a classic prediction-focused
approach on a simple knapsack experiment.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on neuroscience-inspired tasks offer
powerful models of brain computation. However, typical training paradigms rely
on open-loop, supervised settings, whereas real-world learning unfolds in
closed-loop environments. Here, we develop a mathematical theory describing the
learning dynamics of linear RNNs trained in closed-loop contexts. We first
demonstrate that two otherwise identical RNNs, trained in either closed- or
open-loop modes, follow markedly different learning trajectories. To probe this
divergence, we analytically characterize the closed-loop case, revealing
distinct stages aligned with the evolution of the training loss. Specifically,
we show that the learning dynamics of closed-loop RNNs, in contrast to
open-loop ones, are governed by an interplay between two competing objectives:
short-term policy improvement and long-term stability of the agent-environment
interaction. Finally, we apply our framework to a realistic motor control task,
highlighting its broader applicability. Taken together, our results underscore
the importance of modeling closed-loop dynamics in a biologically plausible
setting.

Conclusion: FlexFed为HAR环境中的联邦学习提供了一种高效且隐私友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
privacy by allowing clients to share model updates instead of raw data.
Pervasive computing environments (e.g., for Human Activity Recognition, HAR),
which we focus on in this paper, are characterized by resource-constrained end
devices, streaming sensor data and intermittent client participation.
Variations in user behavior, common in HAR environments, often result in
non-stationary data distributions. As such, existing FL approaches face
challenges in HAR settings due to differing assumptions. The combined effects
of HAR characteristics, namely heterogeneous data and intermittent
participation, can lead to a severe issue called catastrophic forgetting (CF).
Unlike Continuous Learning (CL), which addresses CF using memory and replay
mechanisms, FL's privacy constraints prohibit such strategies.
  To tackle CF in HAR environments, we propose FlexFed, a novel FL approach
that prioritizes data retention for efficient memory use and dynamically
adjusts offline training frequency based on distribution shifts, client
capability and offline duration. To better quantify CF in FL, we introduce a
new metric that accounts for under-represented data, enabling more accurate
evaluations. We also develop a realistic HAR-based evaluation framework that
simulates streaming data, dynamic distributions, imbalances and varying
availability. Experiments show that FlexFed mitigates CF more effectively,
improves FL efficiency by 10 to 15 % and achieves faster, more stable
convergence, especially for infrequent or under-represented data.

Conclusion: 该方法为优化不变成本函数提供了理论工具，适用于黑盒模型和对称约束任务。

Abstract: We study the problem of reducing a task cost functional $W(S)$, defined over
Sobolev-class signals $S$, when the cost is invariant under a global symmetry
group $G \subset \mathrm{Diff}(M)$ and accessible only as a black-box. Such
scenarios arise in machine learning, imaging, and inverse problems, where cost
metrics reflect model outputs or performance scores but are non-differentiable
and model-internal. We propose a variational method that exploits the symmetry
structure to construct explicit, symmetry-breaking deformations of the input
signal. A gauge field $\phi$, obtained by minimizing an auxiliary energy
functional, induces a deformation $h = A_\phi[S]$ that generically lies
transverse to the $G$-orbit of $S$. We prove that, under mild regularity, the
cost $W$ strictly decreases along this direction -- either via Clarke
subdifferential descent or by escaping locally flat plateaus. The exceptional
set of degeneracies has zero Gaussian measure. Our approach requires no access
to model gradients or labels and operates entirely at test time. It provides a
principled tool for optimizing invariant cost functionals via Lie-algebraic
variational flows, with applications to black-box models and
symmetry-constrained tasks.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks are designed to respect symmetries through their
architecture, boosting generalization and sample efficiency when those
symmetries are present in the data distribution. Real-world data, however,
often departs from perfect symmetry because of noise, structural variation,
measurement bias, or other symmetry-breaking effects. Strictly equivariant
models may struggle to fit the data, while unconstrained models lack a
principled way to leverage partial symmetries. Even when the data is fully
symmetric, enforcing equivariance can hurt training by limiting the model to a
restricted region of the parameter space. Guided by homotopy principles, where
an optimization problem is solved by gradually transforming a simpler problem
into a complex one, we introduce Adaptive Constrained Equivariance (ACE), a
constrained optimization approach that starts with a flexible, non-equivariant
model and gradually reduces its deviation from equivariance. This gradual
tightening smooths training early on and settles the model at a data-driven
equilibrium, balancing between equivariance and non-equivariance. Across
multiple architectures and tasks, our method consistently improves performance
metrics, sample efficiency, and robustness to input perturbations compared with
strictly equivariant models and heuristic equivariance relaxations.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, making it ideal for
privacy-sensitive applications. However, FL models often suffer performance
degradation due to distribution shifts between training and deployment.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution by allowing models to
adapt using only test samples. However, existing TTA methods in FL face
challenges such as computational overhead, privacy risks from feature sharing,
and scalability concerns due to memory constraints. To address these
limitations, we propose Federated Continual Test-Time Adaptation (FedCTTA), a
privacy-preserving and computationally efficient framework for federated
adaptation. Unlike prior methods that rely on sharing local feature statistics,
FedCTTA avoids direct feature exchange by leveraging similarity-aware
aggregation based on model output distributions over randomly generated noise
samples. This approach ensures adaptive knowledge sharing while preserving data
privacy. Furthermore, FedCTTA minimizes the entropy at each client for
continual adaptation, enhancing the model's confidence in evolving target
distributions. Our method eliminates the need for server-side training during
adaptation and maintains a constant memory footprint, making it scalable even
as the number of clients or training rounds increases. Extensive experiments
show that FedCTTA surpasses existing methods across diverse temporal and
spatial heterogeneity scenarios.

Abstract: Graphs serve as versatile data structures in numerous real-world
domains-including social networks, molecular biology, and knowledge graphs-by
capturing intricate relational information among entities. Among graph-based
learning techniques, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has gained significant
attention for its ability to derive robust, self-supervised graph
representations through the contrasting of positive and negative sample pairs.
However, a critical challenge lies in ensuring high-quality positive pairs so
that the intrinsic semantic and structural properties of the original graph are
preserved rather than distorted. To address this issue, we propose SRGCL
(Self-Reinforced Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel framework that leverages
the model's own encoder to dynamically evaluate and select high-quality
positive pairs. We designed a unified positive pair generator employing
multiple augmentation strategies, and a selector guided by the manifold
hypothesis to maintain the underlying geometry of the latent space. By adopting
a probabilistic mechanism for selecting positive pairs, SRGCL iteratively
refines its assessment of pair quality as the encoder's representational power
improves. Extensive experiments on diverse graph-level classification tasks
demonstrate that SRGCL, as a plug-in module, consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art GCL methods, underscoring its adaptability and efficacy across
various domains.

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) play an essential role in biostatistics, scientific
machine learning, and Bayesian optimization for their ability to provide
probabilistic predictions and model uncertainty. However, GP inference
struggles to scale to large datasets (which are common in modern applications),
since it requires the solution of a linear system whose size scales
quadratically with the number of samples in the dataset. We propose an
approximate, distributed, accelerated sketch-and-project algorithm
($\texttt{ADASAP}$) for solving these linear systems, which improves
scalability. We use the theory of determinantal point processes to show that
the posterior mean induced by sketch-and-project rapidly converges to the true
posterior mean. In particular, this yields the first efficient, condition
number-free algorithm for estimating the posterior mean along the top spectral
basis functions, showing that our approach is principled for GP inference.
$\texttt{ADASAP}$ outperforms state-of-the-art solvers based on conjugate
gradient and coordinate descent across several benchmark datasets and a
large-scale Bayesian optimization task. Moreover, $\texttt{ADASAP}$ scales to a
dataset with $> 3 \cdot 10^8$ samples, a feat which has not been accomplished

Abstract: The problem of data non-stationarity is commonly addressed in data stream
processing. In a dynamic environment, methods should continuously be ready to
analyze time-varying data -- hence, they should enable incremental training and
respond to concept drifts. An equally important variability typical for
non-stationary data stream environments is the emergence of new, previously
unknown classes. Often, methods focus on one of these two phenomena --
detection of concept drifts or detection of novel classes -- while both
difficulties can be observed in data streams. Additionally, concerning
previously unknown observations, the topic of open set of classes has become
particularly important in recent years, where the goal of methods is to
efficiently classify within known classes and recognize objects outside the
model competence. This article presents a strategy for synthetic data stream
generation in which both concept drifts and the emergence of new classes
representing unknown objects occur. The presented research shows how
unsupervised drift detectors address the task of detecting novelty and concept
drifts and demonstrates how the generated data streams can be utilized in the
open set recognition task.

Conclusion: Panda展示了预训练模型在非线性动力学等抽象数学领域的潜力，并揭示了微分方程的神经缩放规律。

Abstract: Chaotic systems are intrinsically sensitive to small errors, challenging
efforts to construct predictive data-driven models of real-world dynamical
systems such as fluid flows or neuronal activity. Prior efforts comprise either
specialized models trained separately on individual time series, or foundation
models trained on vast time series databases with little underlying dynamical
structure. Motivated by dynamical systems theory, we present Panda, Patched
Attention for Nonlinear DynAmics. We train Panda on a novel synthetic,
extensible dataset of $2 \times 10^4$ chaotic dynamical systems that we
discover using an evolutionary algorithm. Trained purely on simulated data,
Panda exhibits emergent properties: zero-shot forecasting of unseen real world
chaotic systems, and nonlinear resonance patterns in cross-channel attention
heads. Despite having been trained only on low-dimensional ordinary
differential equations, Panda spontaneously develops the ability to predict
partial differential equations without retraining. We demonstrate a neural
scaling law for differential equations, underscoring the potential of
pretrained models for probing abstract mathematical domains like nonlinear
dynamics.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了离散预测任务中替代损失的统计一致性，提出了一种更易验证的条件——间接引发（IE），并证明了其与校准的等价性。对于非多面体替代损失（如凸可微损失），首次证明了在一维情况下的等价性，并构造了高维反例。进一步提出了强IE条件，证明了其对可微替代损失的校准性，并应用于设计一致的可微替代损失。

Motivation: 研究离散预测任务中替代损失的统计一致性验证问题，旨在简化校准条件的验证过程，提出更易操作的条件（如IE和强IE）。

Method: 通过理论分析，证明IE与校准的等价性（一维情况），构造高维反例，提出强IE条件，并验证其校准性。

Result: 在一维情况下，IE与校准等价；高维情况下等价性不成立。强IE对可微替代损失具有校准性，对强凸可微损失是充要条件。

Conclusion: IE和强IE为设计一致的可微替代损失提供了有效工具，简化了验证过程。

Abstract: The statistical consistency of surrogate losses for discrete prediction tasks
is often checked via the condition of calibration. However, directly verifying
calibration can be arduous. Recent work shows that for polyhedral surrogates, a
less arduous condition, indirect elicitation (IE), is still equivalent to
calibration. We give the first results of this type for non-polyhedral
surrogates, specifically the class of convex differentiable losses. We first
prove that under mild conditions, IE and calibration are equivalent for
one-dimensional losses in this class. We construct a counter-example that shows
that this equivalence fails in higher dimensions. This motivates the
introduction of strong IE, a strengthened form of IE that is equally easy to
verify. We establish that strong IE implies calibration for differentiable
surrogates and is both necessary and sufficient for strongly convex,
differentiable surrogates. Finally, we apply these results to a range of
problems to demonstrate the power of IE and strong IE for designing and
analyzing consistent differentiable surrogates.

Motivation: 现有RNN-T推理方法效率低，需逐帧处理，WIND通过并行处理窗口内多帧以加速推理。

Method: WIND并行处理窗口内多帧，支持贪婪解码、批量贪婪解码及新型波束搜索方法。

Result: 贪婪模式下速度提升2.4倍且WER不变；波束搜索方法在速度提升的同时略微提高准确性。

Conclusion: WIND是一种高效且准确的RNN-T推理加速方法，适用于多种解码场景。

Abstract: We propose Windowed Inference for Non-blank Detection (WIND), a novel
strategy that significantly accelerates RNN-T inference without compromising
model accuracy. During model inference, instead of processing frames
sequentially, WIND processes multiple frames simultaneously within a window in
parallel, allowing the model to quickly locate non-blank predictions during
decoding, resulting in significant speed-ups. We implement WIND for greedy
decoding, batched greedy decoding with label-looping techniques, and also
propose a novel beam-search decoding method. Experiments on multiple datasets
with different conditions show that our method, when operating in greedy modes,
speeds up as much as 2.4X compared to the baseline sequential approach while
maintaining identical Word Error Rate (WER) performance. Our beam-search
algorithm achieves slightly better accuracy than alternative methods, with
significantly improved speed. We will open-source our WIND implementation.

Abstract: Generative models of 3D molecular structure play a rapidly growing role in
the design and simulation of molecules. Diffusion models currently dominate the
space of 3D molecule generation, while autoregressive models have trailed
behind. In this work, we present Quetzal, a simple but scalable autoregressive
model that builds molecules atom-by-atom in 3D. Treating each molecule as an
ordered sequence of atoms, Quetzal combines a causal transformer that predicts
the next atom's discrete type with a smaller Diffusion MLP that models the
continuous next-position distribution. Compared to existing autoregressive
baselines, Quetzal achieves substantial improvements in generation quality and
is competitive with the performance of state-of-the-art diffusion models. In
addition, by reducing the number of expensive forward passes through a dense
transformer, Quetzal enables significantly faster generation speed, as well as
exact divergence-based likelihood computation. Finally, without any
architectural changes, Quetzal natively handles variable-size tasks like
hydrogen decoration and scaffold completion. We hope that our work motivates a
perspective on scalability and generality for generative modelling of 3D
molecules.

Abstract: Weather forecasting has long posed a significant challenge for humanity.
While recent AI-based models have surpassed traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods in global forecasting tasks, overfitting remains a
critical issue due to the limited availability of real-world weather data
spanning only a few decades. Unlike fields like computer vision or natural
language processing, where data abundance can mitigate overfitting, weather
forecasting demands innovative strategies to address this challenge with
existing data. In this paper, we explore pre-training methods for weather
forecasting, finding that selecting an appropriately challenging pre-training
task introduces locality bias, effectively mitigating overfitting and enhancing
performance. We introduce Baguan, a novel data-driven model for medium-range
weather forecasting, built on a Siamese Autoencoder pre-trained in a
self-supervised manner and fine-tuned for different lead times. Experimental
results show that Baguan outperforms traditional methods, delivering more
accurate forecasts. Additionally, the pre-trained Baguan demonstrates robust
overfitting control and excels in downstream tasks, such as
subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) modeling and regional forecasting, after
fine-tuning.

Conclusion: CRAFT通过利用CFB特征显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: The past decades witness the significant advancements in time series
forecasting (TSF) across various real-world domains, including e-commerce and
disease spread prediction. However, TSF is usually constrained by the
uncertainty dilemma of predicting future data with limited past observations.
To settle this question, we explore the use of Cross-Future Behavior (CFB) in
TSF, which occurs before the current time but takes effect in the future. We
leverage CFB features and propose the CRoss-Future Behavior Awareness based
Time Series Forecasting method (CRAFT). The core idea of CRAFT is to utilize
the trend of cross-future behavior to mine the trend of time series data to be
predicted. Specifically, to settle the sparse and partial flaws of cross-future
behavior, CRAFT employs the Koopman Predictor Module to extract the key trend
and the Internal Trend Mining Module to supplement the unknown area of the
cross-future behavior matrix. Then, we introduce the External Trend Guide
Module with a hierarchical structure to acquire more representative trends from
higher levels. Finally, we apply the demand-constrained loss to calibrate the
distribution deviation of prediction results. We conduct experiments on
real-world dataset. Experiments on both offline large-scale dataset and online
A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of CRAFT. Our dataset and code is

Result: 在TSP和CVRP的实验表明，L2C-Insert在不同问题规模下表现优异。

Conclusion: L2C-Insert通过插入范式显著提升了NCO的灵活性和解质量。

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimisation (NCO) is a promising learning-based
approach for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) without extensive manual
design. While existing constructive NCO methods typically follow an
appending-based paradigm that sequentially adds unvisited nodes to partial
solutions, this rigid approach often leads to suboptimal results. To overcome
this limitation, we explore the idea of insertion-based paradigm and propose
Learning to Construct with Insertion-based Paradigm (L2C-Insert), a novel
learning-based method for constructive NCO. Unlike traditional approaches,
L2C-Insert builds solutions by strategically inserting unvisited nodes at any
valid position in the current partial solution, which can significantly enhance
the flexibility and solution quality. The proposed framework introduces three
key components: a novel model architecture for precise insertion position
prediction, an efficient training scheme for model optimization, and an
advanced inference technique that fully exploits the insertion paradigm's
flexibility. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world instances
of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP) demonstrate that L2C-Insert consistently achieves superior
performance across various problem sizes.

Abstract: Unsupervised efficient domain adaptive retrieval aims to transfer knowledge
from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, while maintaining
low storage cost and high retrieval efficiency. However, existing methods
typically fail to address potential noise in the target domain, and directly
align high-level features across domains, thus resulting in suboptimal
retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Cross-Domain Diffusion with Progressive Alignment method (COUPLE). This
approach revisits unsupervised efficient domain adaptive retrieval from a graph
diffusion perspective, simulating cross-domain adaptation dynamics to achieve a
stable target domain adaptation process. First, we construct a cross-domain
relationship graph and leverage noise-robust graph flow diffusion to simulate
the transfer dynamics from the source domain to the target domain, identifying
lower noise clusters. We then leverage the graph diffusion results for
discriminative hash code learning, effectively learning from the target domain
while reducing the negative impact of noise. Furthermore, we employ a
hierarchical Mixup operation for progressive domain alignment, which is
performed along the cross-domain random walk paths. Utilizing target domain
discriminative hash learning and progressive domain alignment, COUPLE enables
effective domain adaptive hash learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
COUPLE's effectiveness on competitive benchmarks.

Abstract: To enhance the reliability and credibility of graph neural networks (GNNs)
and improve the transparency of their decision logic, a new field of
explainability of GNNs (XGNN) has emerged. However, two major limitations
severely degrade the performance and hinder the generalizability of existing
XGNN methods: they (a) fail to capture the complete decision logic of GNNs
across diverse distributions in the entire dataset's sample space, and (b)
impose strict prerequisites on edge properties and GNN internal accessibility.
To address these limitations, we propose OPEN, a novel c\textbf{O}mprehensive

the first work in the literature, can infer and partition the entire dataset's
sample space into multiple environments, each containing graphs that follow a
distinct distribution. OPEN further learns the decision logic of GNNs across
different distributions by sampling subgraphs from each environment and
analyzing their predictions, thus eliminating the need for strict
prerequisites. Experimental results demonstrate that OPEN captures nearly
complete decision logic of GNNs, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
fidelity while maintaining similar efficiency, and enhances robustness in
real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: FedGraM能有效防御无目标攻击，提升联邦学习的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables geographically distributed clients to
collaboratively train machine learning models by sharing only their local
models, ensuring data privacy. However, FL is vulnerable to untargeted attacks
that aim to degrade the global model's performance on the underlying data
distribution. Existing defense mechanisms attempt to improve FL's resilience
against such attacks, but their effectiveness is limited in practical FL
environments due to data heterogeneity. On the contrary, we aim to detect and
remove the attacks to mitigate their impact. Generalization contribution plays
a crucial role in distinguishing untargeted attacks. Our observations indicate
that, with limited data, the divergence between embeddings representing
different classes provides a better measure of generalization than direct
accuracy. In light of this, we propose a novel robust aggregation method,
FedGraM, designed to defend against untargeted attacks in FL. The server
maintains an auxiliary dataset containing one sample per class to support
aggregation. This dataset is fed to the local models to extract embeddings.
Then, the server calculates the norm of the Gram Matrix of the embeddings for
each local model. The norm serves as an indicator of each model's inter-class
separation capability in the embedding space. FedGraM identifies and removes
potentially malicious models by filtering out those with the largest norms,
then averages the remaining local models to form the global model. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of FedGraM. Our empirical
results show that with limited data samples used to construct the auxiliary
dataset, FedGraM achieves exceptional performance, outperforming
state-of-the-art defense methods.

Abstract: Filtering-based graph neural networks (GNNs) constitute a distinct class of
GNNs that employ graph filters to handle graph-structured data, achieving
notable success in various graph-related tasks. Conventional methods adopt a
graph-wise filtering paradigm, imposing a uniform filter across all nodes, yet
recent findings suggest that this rigid paradigm struggles with heterophilic
graphs. To overcome this, recent works have introduced node-wise filtering,
which assigns distinct filters to individual nodes, offering enhanced
adaptability. However, a fundamental gap remains: a comprehensive framework
unifying these two strategies is still absent, limiting theoretical insights
into the filtering paradigms. Moreover, through the lens of Contextual
Stochastic Block Model, we reveal that a synthesis of graph-wise and node-wise
filtering provides a sufficient solution for classification on graphs
exhibiting both homophily and heterophily, suggesting the risk of excessive
parameterization and potential overfitting with node-wise filtering. To address
the limitations, this paper introduces Coarsening-guided Partition-wise
Filtering (CPF). CPF innovates by performing filtering on node partitions. The
method begins with structure-aware partition-wise filtering, which filters node
partitions obtained via graph coarsening algorithms, and then performs
feature-aware partition-wise filtering, refining node embeddings via filtering
on clusters produced by $k$-means clustering over features. In-depth analysis
is conducted for each phase of CPF, showing its superiority over other
paradigms. Finally, benchmark node classification experiments, along with a
real-world graph anomaly detection application, validate CPF's efficacy and
practical utility.

Abstract: Research on Graph Structure Learning (GSL) provides key insights for
graph-based clustering, yet current methods like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and contrastive learning often rely heavily on
the original graph structure. Their performance deteriorates when the original
graph's adjacency matrix is too sparse or contains noisy edges unrelated to
clustering. Moreover, these methods depend on learning node embeddings and
using traditional techniques like k-means to form clusters, which may not fully
capture the underlying graph structure between nodes. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces DeSE, a novel unsupervised graph clustering
framework incorporating Deep Structural Entropy. It enhances the original graph
with quantified structural information and deep neural networks to form
clusters. Specifically, we first propose a method for calculating structural
entropy with soft assignment, which quantifies structure in a differentiable
form. Next, we design a Structural Learning layer (SLL) to generate an
attributed graph from the original feature data, serving as a target to enhance
and optimize the original structural graph, thereby mitigating the issue of
sparse connections between graph nodes. Finally, our clustering assignment
method (ASS), based on GNNs, learns node embeddings and a soft assignment
matrix to cluster on the enhanced graph. The ASS layer can be stacked to meet
downstream task requirements, minimizing structural entropy for stable
clustering and maximizing node consistency with edge-based cross-entropy loss.
Extensive comparative experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets
against eight representative unsupervised graph clustering baselines,
demonstrating the superiority of the DeSE in both effectiveness and
interpretability.

complexity of data. MTMC leverages the nuclear norm of singular values as a
measure of manifold capacity, ensuring that the representation of samples
remains informative and well-structured. This method enhances the
discriminability of clusters, allowing the model to capture detailed semantic
features and avoid the loss of critical information during clustering. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on coarse- and fine-grained
datasets, we demonstrate that MTMC outperforms existing GCD methods, improving
both clustering accuracy and the estimation of category numbers. The
integration of MTMC leads to more complete representations, better inter-class
separability, and a reduction in dimensional collapse, establishing MTMC as a
vital component for robust open-world learning. Code is in

Result: 在5个合成数据集和4个真实教育数据集上验证了算法的有效性，特别是在学习路径识别方面。

Conclusion: MAS-KCL能帮助教师设计更全面的学习计划，促进教育的可持续发展。

Abstract: Knowledge components (KCs) are the fundamental units of knowledge in the
field of education. A KC graph illustrates the relationships and dependencies
between KCs. An accurate KC graph can assist educators in identifying the root
causes of learners' poor performance on specific KCs, thereby enabling targeted
instructional interventions. To achieve this, we have developed a KC graph
structure learning algorithm, named MAS-KCL, which employs a multi-agent system
driven by large language models for adaptive modification and optimization of
the KC graph. Additionally, a bidirectional feedback mechanism is integrated
into the algorithm, where AI agents leverage this mechanism to assess the value
of edges within the KC graph and adjust the distribution of generation
probabilities for different edges, thereby accelerating the efficiency of
structure learning. We applied the proposed algorithm to 5 synthetic datasets
and 4 real-world educational datasets, and experimental results validate its
effectiveness in learning path recognition. By accurately identifying learners'
learning paths, teachers are able to design more comprehensive learning plans,
enabling learners to achieve their educational goals more effectively, thus
promoting the sustainable development of education.

Conclusion: FedWBA通过改进局部推断和全局聚合，为个性化贝叶斯联邦学习提供了更高效和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized Bayesian federated learning (PBFL) handles non-i.i.d. client
data and quantifies uncertainty by combining personalization with Bayesian
inference. However, existing PBFL methods face two limitations: restrictive
parametric assumptions in client posterior inference and naive parameter
averaging for server aggregation. To overcome these issues, we propose FedWBA,
a novel PBFL method that enhances both local inference and global aggregation.
At the client level, we use particle-based variational inference for
nonparametric posterior representation. At the server level, we introduce
particle-based Wasserstein barycenter aggregation, offering a more
geometrically meaningful approach. Theoretically, we provide local and global
convergence guarantees for FedWBA. Locally, we prove a KL divergence decrease
lower bound per iteration for variational inference convergence. Globally, we
show that the Wasserstein barycenter converges to the true parameter as the
client data size increases. Empirically, experiments show that FedWBA
outperforms baselines in prediction accuracy, uncertainty calibration, and
convergence rate, with ablation studies confirming its robustness.

Motivation: 探索Rényi测度在GAN中的应用，以解决传统GAN中梯度消失等问题，并提升训练效率。

Method: 利用Rényi交叉熵定义价值函数，形成min-max优化问题，通过调整Rényi阶数α控制梯度大小。

Result: 实验证明α∈(0,1)时梯度放大，收敛更快，可能解决梯度消失问题。

Conclusion: α-GAN为GAN提供了一种新优化框架，尤其在α∈(0,1)时表现更优。

Abstract: This paper proposes $\alpha$-GAN, a generative adversarial network using
R\'{e}nyi measures. The value function is formulated, by R\'{e}nyi cross
entropy, as an expected certainty measure incurred by the discriminator's soft
decision as to where the sample is from, true population or the generator. The
discriminator tries to maximize the R\'{e}nyi certainty about sample source,
while the generator wants to reduce it by injecting fake samples. This forms a
min-max problem with the solution parameterized by the R\'{e}nyi order
$\alpha$. This $\alpha$-GAN reduces to vanilla GAN at $\alpha = 1$, where the
value function is exactly the binary cross entropy. The optimization of
$\alpha$-GAN is over probability (vector) space. It is shown that the gradient
is exponentially enlarged when R\'{e}nyi order is in the range $\alpha \in
(0,1)$. This makes convergence faster, which is verified by experimental
results. A discussion shows that choosing $\alpha \in (0,1)$ may be able to
solve some common problems, e.g., vanishing gradient. A following observation
reveals that this range has not been fully explored in the existing R\'{e}nyi
version GANs.

Conclusion: 多尺度信息和模式建模能显著提升DTM方法的时间序列生成质量。

Abstract: Discrete Token Modeling (DTM), which employs vector quantization techniques,
has demonstrated remarkable success in modeling non-natural language
modalities, particularly in time series generation. While our prior work
SDformer established the first DTM-based framework to achieve state-of-the-art
performance in this domain, two critical limitations persist in existing DTM
approaches: 1) their inability to capture multi-scale temporal patterns
inherent to complex time series data, and 2) the absence of theoretical
foundations to guide model optimization. To address these challenges, we
proposes a novel multi-scale DTM-based time series generation method, called
Multi-Scale Discrete Transformer (MSDformer). MSDformer employs a multi-scale
time series tokenizer to learn discrete token representations at multiple
scales, which jointly characterize the complex nature of time series data.
Subsequently, MSDformer applies a multi-scale autoregressive token modeling
technique to capture the multi-scale patterns of time series within the
discrete latent space. Theoretically, we validate the effectiveness of the DTM
method and the rationality of MSDformer through the rate-distortion theorem.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MSDformer significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results
demonstrate that incorporating multi-scale information and modeling multi-scale
patterns can substantially enhance the quality of generated time series in
DTM-based approaches. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: FEA为熵计算提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案，适用于机器学习和其他需要熵计算的领域。

Abstract: Shannon entropy (SE) and its quantum mechanical analogue von Neumann entropy
are key components in many tools used in physics, information theory, machine
learning (ML) and quantum computing. Besides of the significant amounts of SE
computations required in these fields, the singularity of the SE gradient is
one of the central mathematical reason inducing the high cost, frequently low
robustness and slow convergence of such tools. Here we propose the Fast Entropy
Approximation (FEA) - a non-singular rational approximation of Shannon entropy
and its gradient that achieves a mean absolute error of $10^{-3}$, which is
approximately $20$ times lower than comparable state-of-the-art methods. FEA
allows around $50\%$ faster computation, requiring only $5$ to $6$ elementary
computational operations, as compared to tens of elementary operations behind
the fastest entropy computation algorithms with table look-ups, bitshifts, or
series approximations. On a set of common benchmarks for the feature selection
problem in machine learning, we show that the combined effect of fewer
elementary operations, low approximation error, and a non-singular gradient
allows significantly better model quality and enables ML feature extraction
that is two to three orders of magnitude faster and computationally cheaper
when incorporating FEA into AI tools.

Abstract: Integrating combinatorial optimization layers into neural networks has
recently attracted significant research interest. However, many existing
approaches lack theoretical guarantees or fail to perform adequately when
relying on inexact solvers. This is a critical limitation, as many operations
research problems are NP-hard, often necessitating the use of
neighborhood-based local search heuristics. These heuristics iteratively
generate and evaluate candidate solutions based on an acceptance rule. In this
paper, we introduce a theoretically-principled approach for learning with such
inexact combinatorial solvers. Inspired by the connection between simulated
annealing and Metropolis-Hastings, we propose to transform problem-specific
neighborhood systems used in local search heuristics into proposal
distributions, implementing MCMC on the combinatorial space of feasible
solutions. This allows us to construct differentiable combinatorial layers and
associated loss functions. Replacing an exact solver by a local search strongly
reduces the computational burden of learning on many applications. We
demonstrate our approach on a large-scale dynamic vehicle routing problem with
time windows.

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private second moment estimation and
present a new algorithm that achieve strong privacy-utility trade-offs even for
worst-case inputs under subsamplability assumptions on the data. We call an
input $(m,\alpha,\beta)$-subsamplable if a random subsample of size $m$ (or
larger) preserves w.p $\geq 1-\beta$ the spectral structure of the original
second moment matrix up to a multiplicative factor of $1\pm \alpha$. Building
upon subsamplability, we give a recursive algorithmic framework similar to
Kamath et al 2019, that abides zero-Concentrated Differential Privacy (zCDP)
while preserving w.h.p. the accuracy of the second moment estimation upto an
arbitrary factor of $(1\pm\gamma)$. We then show how to apply our algorithm to
approximate the second moment matrix of a distribution $\mathcal{D}$, even when
a noticeable fraction of the input are outliers.

Abstract: Function approximation is a critical task in various fields. However,
existing neural network approaches struggle with locally complex or
discontinuous functions due to their reliance on a single global model covering
the entire problem space. We propose X-KAN, a novel method that optimizes
multiple local Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) through an evolutionary
rule-based machine learning framework called XCSF. X-KAN combines KAN's high
expressiveness with XCSF's adaptive partitioning capability by implementing
local KAN models as rule consequents and defining local regions via rule
antecedents. Our experimental results on artificial test functions and
real-world datasets demonstrate that X-KAN significantly outperforms
conventional methods, including XCSF, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and KAN, in terms
of approximation accuracy. Notably, X-KAN effectively handles functions with
locally complex or discontinuous structures that are challenging for
conventional KAN, using a compact set of rules (average 7.2 $\pm$ 2.3 rules).
These results validate the effectiveness of using KAN as a local model in XCSF,
which evaluates the rule fitness based on both accuracy and generality. Our
X-KAN implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/X-KAN.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of tabular data in real-world applications, most
benchmarks rely on average-case metrics, which fail to reveal how model
behavior varies across diverse data regimes. To address this, we propose
MultiTab, a benchmark suite and evaluation framework for multi-dimensional,
data-aware analysis of tabular learning algorithms. Rather than comparing
models only in aggregate, MultiTab categorizes 196 publicly available datasets
along key data characteristics, including sample size, label imbalance, and
feature interaction, and evaluates 13 representative models spanning a range of
inductive biases. Our analysis shows that model performance is highly sensitive
to such regimes: for example, models using sample-level similarity excel on
datasets with large sample sizes or high inter-feature correlation, while
models encoding inter-feature dependencies perform best with weakly correlated
features. These findings reveal that inductive biases do not always behave as
intended, and that regime-aware evaluation is essential for understanding and
improving model behavior. MultiTab enables more principled model design and
offers practical guidance for selecting models tailored to specific data
characteristics. All datasets, code, and optimization logs are publicly

Abstract: Algorithmic tools are increasingly used in hiring to improve fairness and
diversity, often by enforcing constraints such as gender-balanced candidate
shortlists. However, we show theoretically and empirically that enforcing equal
representation at the shortlist stage does not necessarily translate into more
diverse final hires, even when there is no gender bias in the hiring stage. We
identify a crucial factor influencing this outcome: the correlation between the
algorithm's screening criteria and the human hiring manager's evaluation
criteria -- higher correlation leads to lower diversity in final hires. Using a
large-scale empirical analysis of nearly 800,000 job applications across
multiple technology firms, we find that enforcing equal shortlists yields
limited improvements in hire diversity when the algorithmic screening closely
mirrors the hiring manager's preferences. We propose a complementary
algorithmic approach designed explicitly to diversify shortlists by selecting
candidates likely to be overlooked by managers, yet still competitive according
to their evaluation criteria. Empirical simulations show that this approach
significantly enhances gender diversity in final hires without substantially
compromising hire quality. These findings highlight the importance of
algorithmic design choices in achieving organizational diversity goals and
provide actionable guidance for practitioners implementing fairness-oriented
hiring algorithms.

Abstract: Autonomous systems that rely on Machine Learning (ML) utilize online fault
tolerance mechanisms, such as runtime monitors, to detect ML prediction errors
and maintain safety during operation. However, the lack of human-interpretable
explanations for these errors can hinder the creation of strong assurances
about the system's safety and reliability. This paper introduces a novel
fuzzy-based monitor tailored for ML perception components. It provides
human-interpretable explanations about how different operating conditions
affect the reliability of perception components and also functions as a runtime
safety monitor. We evaluated our proposed monitor using naturalistic driving
datasets as part of an automated driving case study. The interpretability of
the monitor was evaluated and we identified a set of operating conditions in
which the perception component performs reliably. Additionally, we created an
assurance case that links unit-level evidence of \textit{correct} ML operation
to system-level \textit{safety}. The benchmarking demonstrated that our monitor
achieved a better increase in safety (i.e., absence of hazardous situations)
while maintaining availability (i.e., ability to perform the mission) compared
to state-of-the-art runtime ML monitors in the evaluated dataset.

Abstract: Existing time series tokenization methods predominantly encode a constant
number of samples into individual tokens. This inflexible approach can generate
excessive tokens for even simple patterns like extended constant values,
resulting in substantial computational overhead. Inspired by the success of
byte pair encoding, we propose the first pattern-centric tokenization scheme
for time series analysis. Based on a discrete vocabulary of frequent motifs,
our method merges samples with underlying patterns into tokens, compressing
time series adaptively. Exploiting our finite set of motifs and the continuous
properties of time series, we further introduce conditional decoding as a
lightweight yet powerful post-hoc optimization method, which requires no
gradient computation and adds no computational overhead. On recent time series
foundation models, our motif-based tokenization improves forecasting
performance by 36% and boosts efficiency by 1990% on average. Conditional
decoding further reduces MSE by up to 44%. In an extensive analysis, we
demonstrate the adaptiveness of our tokenization to diverse temporal patterns,
its generalization to unseen data, and its meaningful token representations
capturing distinct time series properties, including statistical moments and
trends.

Interpretability, and Causal Machine Learning. This framework combines the
predictive power of DL with the interpretability of traditional SD models,
resulting in both causal reliability and scalability. The efficacy of the

Abstract: Adversarial attacks to graph analytics are gaining increased attention. To
date, two lines of countermeasures have been proposed to resist various graph
adversarial attacks from the perspectives of either graph per se or graph
neural networks. Nevertheless, a fundamental question lies in whether there
exists an intrinsic adversarial resilience state within a graph regime and how
to find out such a critical state if exists. This paper contributes to tackle
the above research questions from three unique perspectives: i) we regard the
process of adversarial learning on graph as a complex multi-object dynamic
system, and model the behavior of adversarial attack; ii) we propose a
generalized theoretical framework to show the existence of critical adversarial
resilience state; and iii) we develop a condensed one-dimensional function to
capture the dynamic variation of graph regime under perturbations, and pinpoint
the critical state through solving the equilibrium point of dynamic system.
Multi-facet experiments are conducted to show our proposed approach can
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art defense methods under five
commonly-used real-world datasets and three representative attacks.

Abstract: Multimodal spiking neural networks (SNNs) hold significant potential for
energy-efficient sensory processing but face critical challenges in modality
imbalance and temporal misalignment. Current approaches suffer from
uncoordinated convergence speeds across modalities and static fusion mechanisms
that ignore time-varying cross-modal interactions. We propose the temporal
attention-guided adaptive fusion framework for multimodal SNNs with two
synergistic innovations: 1) The Temporal Attention-guided Adaptive Fusion
(TAAF) module that dynamically assigns importance scores to fused spiking
features at each timestep, enabling hierarchical integration of temporally
heterogeneous spike-based features; 2) The temporal adaptive balanced fusion
loss that modulates learning rates per modality based on the above attention
scores, preventing dominant modalities from monopolizing optimization. The
proposed framework implements adaptive fusion, especially in the temporal
dimension, and alleviates the modality imbalance during multimodal learning,
mimicking cortical multisensory integration principles. Evaluations on CREMA-D,
AVE, and EAD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (77.55\%,
70.65\% and 97.5\%accuracy, respectively) with energy efficiency. The system
resolves temporal misalignment through learnable time-warping operations and
faster modality convergence coordination than baseline SNNs. This work
establishes a new paradigm for temporally coherent multimodal learning in
neuromorphic systems, bridging the gap between biological sensory processing
and efficient machine intelligence.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is essential but remains computationally intensive and

predicts weather variables from arbitrary spatiotemporal coordinates, computes
physical terms via automatic differentiation, and uses a physics-informed loss

downscaling by modeling weather as a continuous function and fine-tunes
pre-trained models with minimal overhead, achieving up to 170x faster inference
with only 55K parameters. Experiments show that PhyDL-NWP improves both

Abstract: Artificial neural network pruning is a method in which artificial neural
network sizes can be reduced while attempting to preserve the predicting
capabilities of the network. This is done to make the model smaller or faster
during inference time. In this work we analyze the ability of a selection of
artificial neural network pruning methods to generalize to a new cybersecurity
dataset utilizing a simpler network type than was designed for. We analyze each
method using a variety of pruning degrees to best understand how each algorithm
responds to the new environment. This has allowed us to determine the most well
fit pruning method of those we searched for the task. Unexpectedly, we have
found that many of them do not generalize to the problem well, leaving only a
few algorithms working to an acceptable degree.

Abstract: Reduced-order modeling (ROM) of time-dependent and parameterized differential
equations aims to accelerate the simulation of complex high-dimensional systems
by learning a compact latent manifold representation that captures the
characteristics of the solution fields and their time-dependent dynamics.
Although high-fidelity numerical solvers generate the training datasets, they
have thus far been excluded from the training process, causing the learned
latent dynamics to drift away from the discretized governing physics. This
mismatch often limits generalization and forecasting capabilities. In this
work, we propose Physics-informed ROM ($\Phi$-ROM) by incorporating
differentiable PDE solvers into the training procedure. Specifically, the
latent space dynamics and its dependence on PDE parameters are shaped directly
by the governing physics encoded in the solver, ensuring a strong
correspondence between the full and reduced systems. Our model outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven ROMs and other physics-informed strategies by
accurately generalizing to new dynamics arising from unseen parameters,
enabling long-term forecasting beyond the training horizon, maintaining
continuity in both time and space, and reducing the data cost. Furthermore,
$\Phi$-ROM learns to recover and forecast the solution fields even when trained
or evaluated with sparse and irregular observations of the fields, providing a
flexible framework for field reconstruction and data assimilation. We
demonstrate the framework's robustness across different PDE solvers and
highlight its broad applicability by providing an open-source JAX
implementation readily extensible to other PDE systems and differentiable
solvers.

Abstract: Drug discovery is fundamentally a process of inferring the effects of
treatments on patients, and would therefore benefit immensely from
computational models that can reliably simulate patient responses, enabling
researchers to generate and test large numbers of therapeutic hypotheses safely
and economically before initiating costly clinical trials. Even a more specific
model that predicts the functional response of cells to a wide range of
perturbations would be tremendously valuable for discovering safe and effective
treatments that successfully translate to the clinic. Creating such virtual
cells has long been a goal of the computational research community that
unfortunately remains unachieved given the daunting complexity and scale of
cellular biology. Nevertheless, recent advances in AI, computing power, lab
automation, and high-throughput cellular profiling provide new opportunities
for reaching this goal. In this perspective, we present a vision for developing
and evaluating virtual cells that builds on our experience at Recursion. We
argue that in order to be a useful tool to discover novel biology, virtual
cells must accurately predict the functional response of a cell to
perturbations and explain how the predicted response is a consequence of
modifications to key biomolecular interactions. We then introduce key
principles for designing therapeutically-relevant virtual cells, describe a
lab-in-the-loop approach for generating novel insights with them, and advocate
for biologically-grounded benchmarks to guide virtual cell development.
Finally, we make the case that our approach to virtual cells provides a useful
framework for building other models at higher levels of organization, including
virtual patients. We hope that these directions prove useful to the research
community in developing virtual models optimized for positive impact on drug
discovery outcomes.

Result: PC在MDL目标上单调下降，收敛到块坐标稳定点，提供比梯度下降更紧的泛化界。

Conclusion: PC是一种理论可靠且生物合理的反向传播替代方案，具有泛化和收敛保证。

Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework that connects predictive coding
(PC), a biologically inspired local learning rule, with the minimum description
length (MDL) principle in deep networks. We prove that layerwise PC performs
block-coordinate descent on the MDL two-part code objective, thereby jointly
minimizing empirical risk and model complexity. Using Hoeffding's inequality
and a prefix-code prior, we derive a novel generalization bound of the form
$R(\theta) \le \hat{R}(\theta) + \frac{L(\theta)}{N}$, capturing the tradeoff
between fit and compression. We further prove that each PC sweep monotonically
decreases the empirical two-part codelength, yielding tighter high-probability
risk bounds than unconstrained gradient descent. Finally, we show that repeated
PC updates converge to a block-coordinate stationary point, providing an
approximate MDL-optimal solution. To our knowledge, this is the first result
offering formal generalization and convergence guarantees for PC-trained deep
models, positioning PC as a theoretically grounded and biologically plausible
alternative to backpropagation.

Result: 实验表明，RTL++在VerilogEval基准测试中优于现有模型，验证了图增强上下文的有效性。

Conclusion: RTL++通过图表示显著提升了LLM在RTL代码生成中的性能。

Abstract: As hardware design complexity escalates, there is an urgent need for advanced
automation in electronic design automation (EDA). Traditional register transfer
level (RTL) design methods are manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors.
While commercial (instruction-tuned) large language models (LLMs) shows
promising performance for automation, they pose security and privacy concerns.
Open-source models offer alternatives; however, they frequently fall short in
quality/correctness, largely due to limited, high-quality RTL code data
essential for effective training and generalization. This paper proposes RTL++,
a first-of-its-kind LLM-assisted method for RTL code generation that utilizes
graph representations of code structures to enhance the quality of generated
code. By encoding RTL code into a textualized control flowgraphs (CFG) and data
flow graphs (DFG), RTL++ captures the inherent hierarchy, dependencies, and
relationships within the code. This structured graph-based approach enhances
the context available to LLMs, enabling them to better understand and generate
instructions. By focusing on data generation through graph representations,
RTL++ addresses the limitations of previous approaches that rely solely on code
and suffer from lack of diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that RTL++
outperforms state-of-the-art models fine-tuned for RTL generation, as evaluated
using the VerilogEval benchmark's Pass@1/5/10 metric, as well as the RTLLM1.1
model, which highlight the effectiveness of graph-enhanced context in advancing
the capabilities of LLM-assisted RTL code generation.

Abstract: This work introduces a new method called scalable Bayesian Monte Carlo
(SBMC). The model interpolates between a point estimator and the posterior, and
the algorithm is a parallel implementation of a consistent (asymptotically
unbiased) Bayesian deep learning algorithm: sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) or
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The method is motivated theoretically, and its
utility is demonstrated on practical examples: MNIST, CIFAR, IMDb. A systematic
numerical study reveals that parallel implementations of SMC and MCMC are
comparable to serial implementations in terms of performance and total cost,
and they achieve accuracy at or beyond the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like
deep ensembles at convergence, along with substantially improved uncertainty
quantification (UQ)--in particular, epistemic UQ. But even parallel
implementations are expensive, with an irreducible time barrier much larger
than the cost of the MAP estimator. Compressing time further leads to rapid
degradation of accuracy, whereas UQ remains valuable. By anchoring to a point
estimator we can recover accuracy, while retaining valuable UQ, ultimately
delivering strong performance across metrics for a cost comparable to the SOTA.

Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of Federated Learning (FL) systems, each local
client has access to the global model, posing a critical risk of model leakage.
Existing works have explored injecting watermarks into local models to enable
intellectual property protection. However, these methods either focus on
non-traceable watermarks or traceable but white-box watermarks. We identify a
gap in the literature regarding the formal definition of traceable black-box
watermarking and the formulation of the problem of injecting such watermarks
into FL systems. In this work, we first formalize the problem of injecting
traceable black-box watermarks into FL. Based on the problem, we propose a
novel server-side watermarking method, $\mathbf{TraMark}$, which creates a
traceable watermarked model for each client, enabling verification of model
leakage in black-box settings. To achieve this, $\mathbf{TraMark}$ partitions
the model parameter space into two distinct regions: the main task region and
the watermarking region. Subsequently, a personalized global model is
constructed for each client by aggregating only the main task region while
preserving the watermarking region. Each model then learns a unique watermark
exclusively within the watermarking region using a distinct watermark dataset
before being sent back to the local client. Extensive results across various FL
systems demonstrate that $\mathbf{TraMark}$ ensures the traceability of all
watermarked models while preserving their main task performance.

Result: GDPFed$^+$在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: GDPFed$^+$有效平衡隐私保护和模型性能，适用于异构隐私需求的联邦学习场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning with client-level differential privacy (DP) provides a
promising framework for collaboratively training models while rigorously
protecting clients' privacy. However, classic approaches like DP-FedAvg
struggle when clients have heterogeneous privacy requirements, as they must
uniformly enforce the strictest privacy level across clients, leading to
excessive DP noise and significant model utility degradation. Existing methods
to improve the model utility in such heterogeneous privacy settings often
assume a trusted server and are largely heuristic, resulting in suboptimal
performance and lacking strong theoretical underpinnings. In this work, we
address these challenges under a practical attack model where both clients and
the server are honest-but-curious. We propose GDPFed, which partitions clients
into groups based on their privacy budgets and achieves client-level DP within
each group to reduce the privacy budget waste and hence improve the model
utility. Based on the privacy and convergence analysis of GDPFed, we find that
the magnitude of DP noise depends on both model dimensionality and the
per-group client sampling ratios. To further improve the performance of GDPFed,
we introduce GDPFed$^+$, which integrates model sparsification to eliminate
unnecessary noise and optimizes per-group client sampling ratios to minimize
convergence error. Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GDPFed$^+$, showing substantial
performance gains compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Machine Learning Enabled Systems (MLS) are becoming integral to real-world
applications, but ensuring their sustainable performance over time remains a
significant challenge. These systems operate in dynamic environments and face
runtime uncertainties like data drift and model degradation, which affect the
sustainability of MLS across multiple dimensions: technical, economical,
environmental, and social. While Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) addresses
the technical dimension by streamlining the ML model lifecycle, it overlooks
other dimensions. Furthermore, some traditional practices, such as frequent
retraining, incur substantial energy and computational overhead, thus
amplifying sustainability concerns. To address them, we introduce HarmonE, an
architectural approach that enables self-adaptive capabilities in MLOps
pipelines using the MAPE-K loop. HarmonE allows system architects to define
explicit sustainability goals and adaptation thresholds at design time, and
performs runtime monitoring of key metrics, such as prediction accuracy, energy
consumption, and data distribution shifts, to trigger appropriate adaptation
strategies. We validate our approach using a Digital Twin (DT) of an
Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), focusing on traffic flow prediction as
our primary use case. The DT employs time series ML models to simulate
real-time traffic and assess various flow scenarios. Our results show that
HarmonE adapts effectively to evolving conditions while maintaining accuracy
and meeting sustainability goals.

Abstract: We introduce $\textit{Backward Conformal Prediction}$, a method that
guarantees conformal coverage while providing flexible control over the size of
prediction sets. Unlike standard conformal prediction, which fixes the coverage
level and allows the conformal set size to vary, our approach defines a rule
that constrains how prediction set sizes behave based on the observed data, and
adapts the coverage level accordingly. Our method builds on two key
foundations: (i) recent results by Gauthier et al. [2025] on post-hoc validity
using e-values, which ensure marginal coverage of the form $\mathbb{P}(Y_{\rm
test} \in \hat C_n^{\tilde{\alpha}}(X_{\rm test})) \ge 1 -
\mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ up to a first-order Taylor approximation for any
data-dependent miscoverage $\tilde{\alpha}$, and (ii) a novel leave-one-out
estimator $\hat{\alpha}^{\rm LOO}$ of the marginal miscoverage
$\mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ based on the calibration set, ensuring that the
theoretical guarantees remain computable in practice. This approach is
particularly useful in applications where large prediction sets are impractical
such as medical diagnosis. We provide theoretical results and empirical
evidence supporting the validity of our method, demonstrating that it maintains
computable coverage guarantees while ensuring interpretable, well-controlled
prediction set sizes.

Abstract: Regression models are crucial in recommender systems. However,
retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the
community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias
correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model,
facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems.
Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically

method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically
guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further
generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized
TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves
as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models.

Abstract: In statistical learning, models are classified as regular or singular
depending on whether the mapping from parameters to probability distributions
is injective. Most models with hierarchical structures or latent variables are
singular, for which conventional criteria such as the Akaike Information
Criterion and the Bayesian Information Criterion are inapplicable due to the
breakdown of normal approximations for the likelihood and posterior. To address
this, the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) and the Widely
Applicable Bayesian Information Criterion (WBIC) have been proposed. Since WAIC
and WBIC are computed using posterior distributions at different temperature
settings, separate posterior sampling is generally required. In this paper, we
theoretically derive an asymptotic equation that links WAIC and WBIC, despite
their dependence on different posteriors. This equation yields an
asymptotically unbiased expression of WAIC in terms of the posterior
distribution used for WBIC. The result clarifies the structural relationship
between these criteria within the framework of singular learning theory, and
deepens understanding of their asymptotic behavior. This theoretical
contribution provides a foundation for future developments in the computational
efficiency of model selection in singular models.

Conclusion: TR-DRL通过利用时间对称性，显著提升了深度强化学习在机器人任务中的表现。

Abstract: Symmetry is pervasive in robotics and has been widely exploited to improve
sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, existing
approaches primarily focus on spatial symmetries, such as reflection, rotation,
and translation, while largely neglecting temporal symmetries. To address this
gap, we explore time reversal symmetry, a form of temporal symmetry commonly
found in robotics tasks such as door opening and closing. We propose Time
Reversal symmetry enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (TR-DRL), a framework
that combines trajectory reversal augmentation and time reversal guided reward
shaping to efficiently solve temporally symmetric tasks. Our method generates
reversed transitions from fully reversible transitions, identified by a
proposed dynamics-consistent filter, to augment the training data. For
partially reversible transitions, we apply reward shaping to guide learning,
according to successful trajectories from the reversed task. Extensive
experiments on the Robosuite and MetaWorld benchmarks demonstrate that TR-DRL
is effective in both single-task and multi-task settings, achieving higher
sample efficiency and stronger final performance compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we address two practical challenges of distributed learning in
multi-agent network systems, namely personalization and resilience.
Personalization is the need of heterogeneous agents to learn local models
tailored to their own data and tasks, while still generalizing well; on the
other hand, the learning process must be resilient to cyberattacks or anomalous
training data to avoid disruption. Motivated by a conceptual affinity between
these two requirements, we devise a distributed learning algorithm that
combines distributed gradient descent and the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion
dynamics to fulfill both of them. We quantify its convergence speed and the
neighborhood that contains the final learned models, which can be easily
controlled by tuning the algorithm parameters to enforce a more
personalized/resilient behavior. We numerically showcase the effectiveness of
our algorithm on synthetic and real-world distributed learning tasks, where it
achieves high global accuracy both for personalized models and with malicious
agents compared to standard strategies.

Abstract: This paper addresses the covariate shift problem in the context of
nonparametric regression within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs).
Covariate shift arises in supervised learning when the input distributions of
the training and test data differ, presenting additional challenges for
learning. Although kernel methods have optimal statistical properties, their
high computational demands in terms of time and, particularly, memory, limit
their scalability to large datasets. To address this limitation, the main focus
of this paper is to explore the trade-off between computational efficiency and
statistical accuracy under covariate shift. We investigate the use of random
projections where the hypothesis space consists of a random subspace within a
given RKHS. Our results show that, even in the presence of covariate shift,
significant computational savings can be achieved without compromising learning
performance.

Abstract: We consider the kernelized contextual bandit problem with a large feature
space. This problem involves $K$ arms, and the goal of the forecaster is to
maximize the cumulative rewards through learning the relationship between the
contexts and the rewards. It serves as a general framework for various
decision-making scenarios, such as personalized online advertising and
recommendation systems. Kernelized contextual bandits generalize the linear
contextual bandit problem and offers a greater modeling flexibility. Existing
methods, when applied to Gaussian kernels, yield a trivial bound of $O(T)$ when
we consider $\Omega(\log T)$ feature dimensions. To address this, we introduce
stochastic assumptions on the context distribution and show that no-regret
learning is achievable even when the number of dimensions grows up to the
number of samples. Furthermore, we analyze lenient regret, which allows a
per-round regret of at most $\Delta > 0$. We derive the rate of lenient regret
in terms of $\Delta$.

Method: 引入“Evolving Personal Popularity”指标量化用户偏好，设计因果图整合动态偏好，并应用去混淆训练减少偏差。推理时考虑用户与物品的演化一致性。

Result: CausalEPP在减少流行度偏差的同时提高了推荐准确性，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CausalEPP通过动态个性化方法有效解决了推荐系统中的流行度偏差问题。

Abstract: Popularity bias occurs when popular items are recommended far more frequently
than they should be, negatively impacting both user experience and
recommendation accuracy. Existing debiasing methods mitigate popularity bias
often uniformly across all users and only partially consider the time evolution
of users or items. However, users have different levels of preference for item
popularity, and this preference is evolving over time. To address these issues,
we propose a novel method called CausalEPP (Causal Intervention on Evolving
Personal Popularity) for taming recommendation bias, which accounts for the
evolving personal popularity of users. Specifically, we first introduce a
metric called {Evolving Personal Popularity} to quantify each user's preference
for popular items. Then, we design a causal graph that integrates evolving
personal popularity into the conformity effect, and apply deconfounded training
to mitigate the popularity bias of the causal graph. During inference, we
consider the evolution consistency between users and items to achieve a better
recommendation. Empirical studies demonstrate that CausalEPP outperforms
baseline methods in reducing popularity bias while improving recommendation
accuracy.

Conclusion: FlowTSE为生成式TSE提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，尤其在相位重建任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Target speaker extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a specific speaker's speech
from a mixture using speaker enrollment as a reference. While most existing
approaches are discriminative, recent generative methods for TSE achieve strong
results. However, generative methods for TSE remain underexplored, with most
existing approaches relying on complex pipelines and pretrained components,
leading to computational overhead. In this work, we present FlowTSE, a simple
yet effective TSE approach based on conditional flow matching. Our model
receives an enrollment audio sample and a mixed speech signal, both represented
as mel-spectrograms, with the objective of extracting the target speaker's
clean speech. Furthermore, for tasks where phase reconstruction is crucial, we
propose a novel vocoder conditioned on the complex STFT of the mixed signal,
enabling improved phase estimation. Experimental results on standard TSE
benchmarks show that FlowTSE matches or outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization involves a hierarchical structure where one problem is
nested within another, leading to complex interdependencies between levels. We
propose a single-loop, tuning-free algorithm that guarantees anytime
feasibility, i.e., approximate satisfaction of the lower-level optimality
condition, while ensuring descent of the upper-level objective. At each
iteration, a convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with a
closed-form solution yields the search direction, followed by a backtracking
line search inspired by control barrier functions to ensure safe, uniformly
positive step sizes. The resulting method is scalable, requires no
hyperparameter tuning, and converges under mild local regularity assumptions.
We establish an O(1/k) ergodic convergence rate and demonstrate the algorithm's
effectiveness on representative bilevel tasks.

Abstract: With rapid advancements in machine learning, first-order algorithms have
emerged as the backbone of modern optimization techniques, owing to their
computational efficiency and low memory requirements. Recently, the connection
between accelerated gradient methods and damped heavy-ball motion, particularly
within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics, has inspired the development of
innovative quantum algorithms for continuous optimization. One such algorithm,
Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD), leverages quantum tunneling to escape saddle
points and local minima, facilitating the discovery of global solutions in
complex optimization landscapes. However, QHD faces several challenges,
including slower convergence rates compared to classical gradient methods and
limited robustness in highly non-convex problems due to the non-local nature of
quantum states. Furthermore, the original QHD formulation primarily relies on
function value information, which limits its effectiveness. Inspired by
insights from high-resolution differential equations that have elucidated the
acceleration mechanisms in classical methods, we propose an enhancement to QHD
by incorporating gradient information, leading to what we call gradient-based
QHD. Gradient-based QHD achieves faster convergence and significantly increases
the likelihood of identifying global solutions. Numerical simulations on
challenging problem instances demonstrate that gradient-based QHD outperforms
existing quantum and classical methods by at least an order of magnitude.

Abstract: Existing works on Binary Neural Network (BNN) mainly focus on model's weights
and activations while discarding considerations on the input raw data. This
article introduces Generic Learned Thermometer (GLT), an encoding technique to
improve input data representation for BNN, relying on learning non linear
quantization thresholds. This technique consists in multiple data binarizations
which can advantageously replace a conventional Analog to Digital Conversion

compact topology with light-weight grouped convolutions being trained thanks to
block pruning and Knowledge Distillation (KD), aiming at reducing furthermore
the model size so as its computational complexity. We show that GLT brings
versatility to the BNN by intrinsically performing global tone mapping,
enabling significant accuracy gains in practice (demonstrated by simulations on
the STL-10 and VWW datasets). Moreover, when combining GLT with our proposed
block-pruning technique, we successfully achieve lightweight (under 1Mb),
fully-binarized models with limited accuracy degradation while being suitable

Abstract: Recent progress in AI has established neural operators as powerful tools that
can predict the evolution of partial differential equations, such as the
Navier-Stokes equations. Some complex problems rely on sophisticated algorithms
to deal with strong discontinuities in the computational domain. For example,
liquid-vapour multiphase flows are a challenging problem in many
configurations, particularly those involving large density gradients or phase
change. The complexity mentioned above has not allowed for fine control of fast
industrial processes or applications because computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
models do not have a quick enough forecasting ability. This work demonstrates
that the time scale of neural operators-based predictions is comparable to the
time scale of multi-phase applications, thus proving they can be used to
control processes that require fast response. Neural Operators can be trained
using experimental data, simulations or a combination. In the following, neural
operators were trained in volume of fluid simulations, and the resulting
predictions showed very high accuracy, particularly in predicting the evolution
of the liquid-vapour interface, one of the most critical tasks in a multi-phase

Abstract: The data-driven discovery of long-time macroscopic dynamics and
thermodynamics of dissipative systems with particle fidelity is hampered by
significant obstacles. These include the strong time-scale limitations inherent
to particle simulations, the non-uniqueness of the thermodynamic potentials and
operators from given macroscopic dynamics, and the need for efficient
uncertainty quantification. This paper introduces Statistical-Physics Informed
Epistemic Diffusion Models (SPIEDiff), a machine learning framework designed to
overcome these limitations in the context of purely dissipative systems by
leveraging statistical physics, conditional diffusion models, and epinets. We
evaluate the proposed framework on stochastic Arrhenius particle processes and
demonstrate that SPIEDiff can accurately uncover both thermodynamics and
kinetics, while enabling reliable long-time macroscopic predictions using only
short-time particle simulation data. SPIEDiff can deliver accurate predictions
with quantified uncertainty in minutes, drastically reducing the computational
demand compared to direct particle simulations, which would take days or years
in the examples considered. Overall, SPIEDiff offers a robust and trustworthy
pathway for the data-driven discovery of thermodynamic models.

Abstract: The use of machine learning for modeling, understanding, and controlling
large-scale physics systems is quickly gaining in popularity, with examples
ranging from electromagnetism over nuclear fusion reactors and
magneto-hydrodynamics to fluid mechanics and climate modeling. These systems --
governed by partial differential equations -- present unique challenges
regarding the large number of degrees of freedom and the complex dynamics over
many scales both in space and time, and additional measures to improve accuracy
and sample efficiency are highly desirable. We present an end-to-end
equivariant surrogate model consisting of an equivariant convolutional
autoencoder and an equivariant convolutional LSTM using $G$-steerable kernels.
As a case study, we consider the three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection, which describes the buoyancy-driven fluid flow between a heated
bottom and a cooled top plate. While the system is E(2)-equivariant in the
horizontal plane, the boundary conditions break the translational equivariance
in the vertical direction. Our architecture leverages vertically stacked layers
of $D_4$-steerable kernels, with additional partial kernel sharing in the
vertical direction for further efficiency improvement. Our results demonstrate
significant gains both in sample and parameter efficiency, as well as a better
scaling to more complex dynamics, that is, larger Rayleigh numbers. The

Abstract: Computing partial differential equation (PDE) operators via nested
backpropagation is expensive, yet popular, and severely restricts their utility
for scientific machine learning. Recent advances, like the forward Laplacian
and randomizing Taylor mode automatic differentiation (AD), propose forward
schemes to address this. We introduce an optimization technique for Taylor mode
that 'collapses' derivatives by rewriting the computational graph, and
demonstrate how to apply it to general linear PDE operators, and randomized
Taylor mode. The modifications simply require propagating a sum up the
computational graph, which could -- or should -- be done by a machine learning
compiler, without exposing complexity to users. We implement our collapsing
procedure and evaluate it on popular PDE operators, confirming it accelerates
Taylor mode and outperforms nested backpropagation.

Abstract: We present the first unsupervised learning model for finding Maximum
Independent Sets (MaxIS) in dynamic graphs where edges change over time. Our
method combines structural learning from graph neural networks (GNNs) with a
learned distributed update mechanism that, given an edge addition or deletion
event, modifies nodes' internal memories and infers their MaxIS membership in a
single, parallel step. We parameterize our model by the update mechanism's
radius and investigate the resulting performance-runtime tradeoffs for various
dynamic graph topologies. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art MaxIS
methods for static graphs, including a mixed integer programming solver,
deterministic rule-based algorithms, and a heuristic learning framework based
on dynamic programming and GNNs. Across synthetic and real-world dynamic graphs
of 100-10,000 nodes, our model achieves competitive approximation ratios with
excellent scalability; on large graphs, it significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art heuristic learning framework in solution quality, runtime, and
memory usage. Our model generalizes well on graphs 100x larger than the ones
used for training, achieving performance at par with both a greedy technique
and a commercial mixed integer programming solver while running 1.5-23x faster
than greedy.

Abstract: Characterizing the ground state properties of quantum systems is fundamental
to capturing their behavior but computationally challenging. Recent advances in
AI have introduced novel approaches, with diverse machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL) models proposed for this purpose. However, the necessity and
specific role of DL models in these tasks remain unclear, as prior studies
often employ varied or impractical quantum resources to construct datasets,
resulting in unfair comparisons. To address this, we systematically benchmark
DL models against traditional ML approaches across three families of
Hamiltonian, scaling up to 127 qubits in three crucial ground-state learning
tasks while enforcing equivalent quantum resource usage. Our results reveal
that ML models often achieve performance comparable to or even exceeding that
of DL approaches across all tasks. Furthermore, a randomization test
demonstrates that measurement input features have minimal impact on DL models'
prediction performance. These findings challenge the necessity of current DL
models in many quantum system learning scenarios and provide valuable insights
into their effective utilization.

Abstract: Ionic models, described by systems of stiff ordinary differential equations,
are fundamental tools for simulating the complex dynamics of excitable cells in
both Computational Neuroscience and Cardiology. Approximating these models
using Artificial Neural Networks poses significant challenges due to their
inherent stiffness, multiscale nonlinearities, and the wide range of dynamical
behaviors they exhibit, including multiple equilibrium points, limit cycles,
and intricate interactions. While in previous studies the dynamics of the
transmembrane potential has been predicted in low dimensionality settings, in
the present study we extend these results by investigating whether Fourier
Neural Operators can effectively learn the evolution of all the state variables
within these dynamical systems in higher dimensions. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach by accurately learning the dynamics of three
well-established ionic models with increasing dimensionality: the two-variable
FitzHugh-Nagumo model, the four-variable Hodgkin-Huxley model, and the
forty-one-variable O'Hara-Rudy model. To ensure the selection of near-optimal
configurations for the Fourier Neural Operator, we conducted automatic
hyperparameter tuning under two scenarios: an unconstrained setting, where the
number of trainable parameters is not limited, and a constrained case with a
fixed number of trainable parameters. Both constrained and unconstrained
architectures achieve comparable results in terms of accuracy across all the
models considered. However, the unconstrained architecture required
approximately half the number of training epochs to achieve similar error
levels, as evidenced by the loss function values recorded during training.
These results underline the capabilities of Fourier Neural Operators to
accurately capture complex multiscale dynamics, even in high-dimensional
dynamical systems.

Conclusion: SLAM是一种全面且准确的评估空间标注相似性的方法，适用于科学研究和实践。

Abstract: Spatial labeling assigns labels to specific spatial locations to characterize
their spatial properties and relationships, with broad applications in
scientific research and practice. Measuring the similarity between two spatial
labelings is essential for understanding their differences and the contributing
factors, such as changes in location properties or labeling methods. An
adequate and unbiased measurement of spatial labeling similarity should
consider the number of matched labels (label agreement), the topology of
spatial label distribution, and the heterogeneous impacts of mismatched labels.
However, existing methods often fail to account for all these aspects. To
address this gap, we propose a methodological framework to guide the
development of methods that meet these requirements. Given two spatial
labelings, the framework transforms them into graphs based on location
organization, labels, and attributes (e.g., location significance). The
distributions of their graph attributes are then extracted, enabling an
efficient computation of distributional discrepancy to reflect the
dissimilarity level between the two labelings. We further provide a concrete
implementation of this framework, termed Spatial Labeling Analogy Metric
(SLAM), along with an analysis of its theoretical foundation, for evaluating
spatial labeling results in spatial transcriptomics (ST) \textit{as per} their
similarity with ground truth labeling. Through a series of carefully designed
experimental cases involving both simulated and real ST data, we demonstrate
that SLAM provides a comprehensive and accurate reflection of labeling quality
compared to other well-established evaluation metrics. Our code is available at

Conclusion: GraNT证明了教学图属性学习器与非参数学习器的一致性，为图结构数据学习提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Inferring properties of graph-structured data, e.g., the solubility of
molecules, essentially involves learning the implicit mapping from graphs to
their properties. This learning process is often costly for graph property
learners like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). To address this, we propose
a paradigm called Graph Neural Teaching (GraNT) that reinterprets the learning
process through a novel nonparametric teaching perspective. Specifically, the
latter offers a theoretical framework for teaching implicitly defined (i.e.,
nonparametric) mappings via example selection. Such an implicit mapping is
realized by a dense set of graph-property pairs, with the GraNT teacher
selecting a subset of them to promote faster convergence in GCN training. By
analytically examining the impact of graph structure on parameter-based
gradient descent during training, and recasting the evolution of GCNs--shaped
by parameter updates--through functional gradient descent in nonparametric
teaching, we show for the first time that teaching graph property learners
(i.e., GCNs) is consistent with teaching structure-aware nonparametric
learners. These new findings readily commit GraNT to enhancing learning
efficiency of the graph property learner, showing significant reductions in
training time for graph-level regression (-36.62%), graph-level classification
(-38.19%), node-level regression (-30.97%) and node-level classification
(-47.30%), all while maintaining its generalization performance.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile sensors has the potential to provide

applications in mHealth. However, data collection remains limited due to
stringent ethical regulations, privacy concerns, and other constraints,
hindering progress in the field. Synthetic data generation, particularly
through Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, has emerged as a

presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art generative models for time

multi-modality, long-range dependencies, and conditional generation-key
challenges in the mHealth domain. To ensure a fair comparison, we introduce a

synthetic data and its utility in downstream predictive tasks. Our findings

maintaining cross-modal consistency, preserving temporal coherence, and
ensuring robust performance in train-on-synthetic, test-on-real, and data

Conclusion: PTWD模型通过结合TWD和PID控制，显著提升了动态网络链接预测的性能。

Abstract: Link prediction in dynamic networks remains a fundamental challenge in
network science, requiring the inference of potential interactions and their
evolving strengths through spatiotemporal pattern analysis. Traditional static
network methods have inherent limitations in capturing temporal dependencies
and weight dynamics, while tensor-based methods offer a promising paradigm by
encoding dynamic networks into high-order tensors to explicitly model
multidimensional interactions across nodes and time. Among them, tensor wheel
decomposition (TWD) stands out for its innovative topological structure, which
decomposes high-order tensors into cyclic factors and core tensors to maintain
structural integrity. To improve the prediction accuracy, this study introduces
a PID-controlled tensor wheel decomposition (PTWD) model, which mainly adopts
the following two ideas: 1) exploiting the representation power of TWD to
capture the latent features of dynamic network topology and weight evolution,
and 2) integrating the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control principle
into the optimization process to obtain a stable model parameter learning
scheme. The performance on four real datasets verifies that the proposed PTWD
model has more accurate link prediction capabilities compared to other models.

hospitals to collaboratively train AI models without sharing raw patient data,
addressing privacy concerns and data scarcity that hinder traditional
centralized models. The research involved hospitals and research centers in
eight African countries. Most sites used local datasets, while Ghana and The
Gambia used public ones. The study compared locally trained models with a
federated model built across all institutions to evaluate FL's real-world
feasibility. Despite its promise, implementing FL in sub-Saharan Africa faces
challenges such as poor infrastructure, unreliable internet, limited digital
literacy, and weak AI regulations. Some institutions were also reluctant to
share model updates due to data control concerns. In conclusion, FL shows
strong potential for enabling AI-driven healthcare in underserved regions, but
broader adoption will require improvements in infrastructure, education, and
regulatory support.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the integration of Sequence Encoding for Online
Parameter Identification with Physics-Informed Neural Networks to create a
model that, once trained, can be utilized for real time applications with
variable parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Recently, the
combination of PINNs with Sparse Regression has emerged as a method for
performing dynamical system identification through supervised learning and
sparse regression optimization, while also solving the dynamics using PINNs.
However, this approach can be limited by variations in parameters or boundary
and initial conditions, requiring retraining of the model whenever changes
occur. In this work, we introduce an architecture that employs Deep Sets or
Sequence Encoders to encode dynamic parameters, boundary conditions, and
initial conditions, using these encoded features as inputs for the PINN,
enabling the model to adapt to changes in parameters, BCs, and ICs. We apply
this approach to three different problems. First, we analyze the Rossler ODE
system, demonstrating the robustness of the model with respect to noise and its
ability to generalize. Next, we explore the model's capability in a 2D
Navier-Stokes PDE problem involving flow past a cylinder with a parametric
sinusoidal inlet velocity function, showing that the model can encode pressure
data from a few points to identify the inlet velocity profile and utilize
physics to compute velocity and pressure throughout the domain. Finally, we
address a 1D heat monitoring problem using real data from the heating of glass
fiber and thermoplastic composite plates.

Abstract: To accelerate diffusion model inference, numerical solvers perform poorly at
extremely small steps, while distillation techniques often introduce complexity
and instability. This work presents an intermediate strategy, balancing
performance and cost, by learning ODE integration using loss functions derived
from the derivative-integral relationship, inspired by Monte Carlo integration
and Picard iteration. From a geometric perspective, the losses operate by
gradually extending the tangent to the secant, thus are named as secant losses.
The secant losses can rapidly convert (via fine-tuning or distillation) a
pretrained diffusion model into its secant version. In our experiments, the
secant version of EDM achieves a $10$-step FID of $2.14$ on CIFAR-10, while the
secant version of SiT-XL/2 attains a $4$-step FID of $2.27$ and an $8$-step FID
of $1.96$ on ImageNet-$256\times256$. Code will be available.

structured numerical weather data with unstructured textual event narratives.
Our architecture combines a Random Forest and RoBERTa-based transformer through
a late fusion mechanism, enabling robust and context-aware wind hazard
prediction. The system is tailored for underserved tribal communities and
supports block-level risk assessment. Experimental results show significant
performance gains over traditional baselines. Furthermore, gradient-based
sensitivity and ablation studies provide insight into the model's
decision-making process, enhancing transparency and operational trust. The
findings demonstrate both predictive effectiveness and practical value in
supporting emergency preparedness and advancing community resilience.

Abstract: Time series clustering promises to uncover hidden structural patterns in data
with applications across healthcare, finance, industrial systems, and other
critical domains. However, without validated ground truth information,
researchers cannot objectively assess clustering quality or determine whether
poor results stem from absent structures in the data, algorithmic limitations,
or inappropriate validation methods, raising the question whether clustering is
"more art than science" (Guyon et al., 2009). To address these challenges, we
introduce CSTS (Correlation Structures in Time Series), a synthetic benchmark
for evaluating the discovery of correlation structures in multivariate time
series data. CSTS provides a clean benchmark that enables researchers to
isolate and identify specific causes of clustering failures by differentiating
between correlation structure deterioration and limitations of clustering
algorithms and validation methods. Our contributions are: (1) a comprehensive
benchmark for correlation structure discovery with distinct correlation
structures, systematically varied data conditions, established performance
thresholds, and recommended evaluation protocols; (2) empirical validation of
correlation structure preservation showing moderate distortion from
downsampling and minimal effects from distribution shifts and sparsification;
and (3) an extensible data generation framework enabling structure-first
clustering evaluation. A case study demonstrates CSTS's practical utility by
identifying an algorithm's previously undocumented sensitivity to non-normal
distributions, illustrating how the benchmark enables precise diagnosis of
methodological limitations. CSTS advances rigorous evaluation standards for
correlation-based time series clustering.

Abstract: Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has been widely employed to measure the
distance between probability distributions. In this paper, we propose using MMD
to solve continuous multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). For solving
MOPs, a common approach is to minimize the distance (e.g., Hausdorff) between a
finite approximate set of the Pareto front and a reference set. Viewing these
two sets as empirical measures, we propose using MMD to measure the distance
between them. To minimize the MMD value, we provide the analytical expression
of its gradient and Hessian matrix w.r.t. the search variables, and use them to
devise a novel set-oriented, MMD-based Newton (MMDN) method. Also, we analyze
the theoretical properties of MMD's gradient and Hessian, including the
first-order stationary condition and the eigenspectrum of the Hessian, which
are important for verifying the correctness of MMDN. To solve complicated
problems, we propose hybridizing MMDN with multiobjective evolutionary
algorithms (MOEAs), where we first execute an EA for several iterations to get
close to the global Pareto front and then warm-start MMDN with the result of
the MOEA to efficiently refine the approximation. We empirically test the
hybrid algorithm on 11 widely used benchmark problems, and the results show the
hybrid (MMDN + MOEA) can achieve a much better optimization accuracy than EA
alone with the same computation budget.

Abstract: Accurate and timely alerts for drivers or automated systems to unfolding
collisions remains a challenge in road safety, particularly in highly
interactive urban traffic. Existing approaches require labour-intensive
annotation of sparse risk, struggle to consider varying interaction context, or
are useful only in the scenarios they are designed for. To address these
limits, this study introduces the generalised surrogate safety measure (GSSM),
a new approach that learns exclusively from naturalistic driving without crash
or risk labels. GSSM captures the patterns of normal driving and estimates the
extent to which a traffic interaction deviates from the norm towards unsafe
extreme. Utilising neural networks, normal interactions are characterised by
context-conditioned distributions of multi-directional spacing between road
users. In the same interaction context, a spacing closer than normal entails
higher risk of potential collision. Then a context-adaptive risk score and its
associated probability can be calculated based on the theory of extreme values.
Any measurable factors, such as motion kinematics, weather, lighting, can serve
as part of the context, allowing for diverse coverage of safety-critical
interactions. Multiple public driving datasets are used to train GSSMs, which
are tested with 4,875 real-world crashes and near-crashes reconstructed from
the SHRP2 NDS. A vanilla GSSM using only instantaneous states achieves AUPRC of
0.9 and secures a median time advance of 2.6 seconds to prevent potential
collisions. Additional data and contextual factors provide further performance
gains. Across various interaction types such as rear-end, merging, and
crossing, the accuracy and timeliness of GSSM consistently outperforms existing
baselines. GSSM therefore establishes a scalable, context-aware, and
generalisable foundation to proactively quantify collision risk in traffic
interactions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合聚类和注意力机制的GRU模型（CAGRU），用于预测客户购买意图，解决了客户群体不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注客户未来购买的具体产品类型，而忽略了客户是否会重复购买这一关键因素。客户群体的不平衡分布（如偶尔购买者和忠诚客户的比例悬殊）使传统时间序列预测方法受限。

Method: 提出CAGRU模型，通过多模态数据进行客户画像和聚类，利用GRU提取时间序列特征，并引入注意力机制捕捉序列位置的重要性。针对不同客户群体分别训练模型。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验验证了CAGRU的优越性。

Conclusion: CAGRU能有效处理客户群体不平衡问题，提升购买意图预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting customers' purchase intentions is critical to the
success of a business strategy. Current researches mainly focus on analyzing
the specific types of products that customers are likely to purchase in the
future, little attention has been paid to the critical factor of whether
customers will engage in repurchase behavior. Predicting whether a customer
will make the next purchase is a classic time series forecasting task. However,
in real-world purchasing behavior, customer groups typically exhibit imbalance
- i.e., there are a large number of occasional buyers and a small number of
loyal customers. This head-to-tail distribution makes traditional time series
forecasting methods face certain limitations when dealing with such problems.
To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a unified Clustering and
Attention mechanism GRU model (CAGRU) that leverages multi-modal data for
customer purchase intention prediction. The framework first performs customer
profiling with respect to the customer characteristics and clusters the
customers to delineate the different customer clusters that contain similar
features. Then, the time series features of different customer clusters are
extracted by GRU neural network and an attention mechanism is introduced to
capture the significance of sequence locations. Furthermore, to mitigate the
head-to-tail distribution of customer segments, we train the model separately
for each customer segment, to adapt and capture more accurately the differences
in behavioral characteristics between different customer segments, as well as
the similar characteristics of the customers within the same customer segment.
We constructed four datasets and conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed CAGRU approach.

Motivation: 现有计算Wasserstein重心的方法通常需要复杂的投影操作或对偶约束，导致计算效率低下。本文旨在提出一种更简单且高效的对偶方法。

Method: 基于Sobolev几何设计SGA算法，避免c-凹投影操作，同时保证全局收敛性。

Result: SGA算法在计算效率和理论简化上优于现有方法，实验验证了其优越性能。

Conclusion: SGA算法为Wasserstein重心计算提供了一种高效且理论简洁的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new constraint-free concave dual formulation for the
Wasserstein barycenter. Tailoring the vanilla dual gradient ascent algorithm to
the Sobolev geometry, we derive a scalable Sobolev gradient ascent (SGA)
algorithm to compute the barycenter for input distributions supported on a
regular grid. Despite the algorithmic simplicity, we provide a global
convergence analysis that achieves the same rate as the classical subgradient
descent methods for minimizing nonsmooth convex functions in the Euclidean
space. A central feature of our SGA algorithm is that the computationally
expensive $c$-concavity projection operator enforced on the Kantorovich dual
potentials is unnecessary to guarantee convergence, leading to significant
algorithmic and theoretical simplifications over all existing primal and dual
methods for computing the exact barycenter. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of SGA over the existing optimal
transport barycenter solvers.

Abstract: Social networks have a small number of large hubs, and a large number of
small dense communities. We propose a generative model that captures both hub

our model is a graphon mixture, enabling us to generate sequences of graphs
where each graph is a combination of sparse and dense graphs. We propose a new
condition on sparse graphs (the max-degree), which enables us to identify hubs.
We show theoretically that we can estimate the normalized degree of the hubs,
as well as estimate the graphon corresponding to sparse components of graph
mixtures. We illustrate our approach on synthetic data, citation graphs, and
social networks, showing the benefits of explicitly modeling sparse graphs.

Abstract: A brain-computer interface (BCI) system enables direct communication between
the brain and external devices, offering significant potential for assistive
technologies and advanced human-computer interaction. Despite progress, BCI
systems face persistent challenges, including signal variability,
classification inefficiency, and difficulty adapting to individual users in
real time. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid quantum learning model,
termed QSVM-QNN, which integrates a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with
a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), to improve classification accuracy and
robustness in EEG-based BCI tasks. Unlike existing models, QSVM-QNN combines
the decision boundary capabilities of QSVM with the expressive learning power
of QNN, leading to superior generalization performance. The proposed model is
evaluated on two benchmark EEG datasets, achieving high accuracies of 0.990 and
0.950, outperforming both classical and standalone quantum models. To
demonstrate real-world viability, we further validated the robustness of QNN,
QSVM, and QSVM-QNN against six realistic quantum noise models, including bit
flip and phase damping. These experiments reveal that QSVM-QNN maintains stable
performance under noisy conditions, establishing its applicability for
deployment in practical, noisy quantum environments. Beyond BCI, the proposed
hybrid quantum architecture is generalizable to other biomedical and
time-series classification tasks, offering a scalable and noise-resilient
solution for next-generation neurotechnological systems.

Conclusion: k-LMVAR是一种高效且可扩展的时间序列聚类方法，适用于向量时间序列。

Abstract: Clustering of time series based on their underlying dynamics is keeping
attracting researchers due to its impacts on assisting complex system
modelling. Most current time series clustering methods handle only scalar time
series, treat them as white noise, or rely on domain knowledge for high-quality
feature construction, where the autocorrelation pattern/feature is mostly
ignored. Instead of relying on heuristic feature/metric construction, the
system identification approach allows treating vector time series clustering by
explicitly considering their underlying autoregressive dynamics. We first
derive a clustering algorithm based on a mixture autoregressive model.
Unfortunately it turns out to have significant computational problems. We then
derive a `small-noise' limiting version of the algorithm, which we call k-LMVAR
(Limiting Mixture Vector AutoRegression), that is computationally manageable.
We develop an associated BIC criterion for choosing the number of clusters and
model order. The algorithm performs very well in comparative simulations and
also scales well computationally.

Abstract: Background: Deep learning has potential to improve the efficiency and
consistency of radiation therapy planning, but clinical adoption is hindered by
the limited model generalizability due to data scarcity and heterogeneity among
institutions. Although aggregating data from different institutions could
alleviate this problem, data sharing is a practical challenge due to concerns
about patient data privacy and other technical obstacles. Purpose: This work
aims to address this dilemma by developing FedKBP+, a comprehensive federated
learning (FL) platform for predictive tasks in real-world applications in
radiotherapy treatment planning. Methods: We implemented a unified
communication stack based on Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC) to support
communication between participants whether located on the same workstation or
distributed across multiple workstations. In addition to supporting the
centralized FL strategies commonly available in existing open-source
frameworks, FedKBP+ also provides a fully decentralized FL model where
participants directly exchange model weights to each other through Peer-to-Peer
communication. We evaluated FedKBP+ on three predictive tasks using
scale-attention network (SA-Net) as the predictive model. Conclusions: Our
results demonstrate that FedKBP+ is highly effective, efficient and robust,

Conclusion: 结论表明强化学习方法在认知无线电网络中具有潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, a reinforcement learning technique is employed to maximize the
performance of a cognitive radio network (CRN). In the presence of primary
users (PUs), it is presumed that two secondary users (SUs) access the licensed
band within underlay mode. In addition, the SU transmitter is assumed to be an
energy-constrained device that requires harvesting energy in order to transmit
signals to their intended destination. Therefore, we propose that there are two
main sources of energy; the interference of PUs' transmissions and ambient
radio frequency (RF) sources. The SU will select whether to gather energy from
PUs or only from ambient sources based on a predetermined threshold. The
process of energy harvesting from the PUs' messages is accomplished via the
time switching approach. In addition, based on a deep Q-network (DQN) approach,
the SU transmitter determines whether to collect energy or transmit messages
during each time slot as well as selects the suitable transmission power in
order to maximize its average data rate. Our approach outperforms a baseline
strategy and converges, as shown by our findings.

Abstract: In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling
rates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This
sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based
systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery,
aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous
studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder
captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target
trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network
and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall
performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage
the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the
road network.
  To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of
trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics
and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for
trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce
PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics
concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we
present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics
for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential
equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively
handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/ysygMhdxw/TEDTrajRec/.

Abstract: This paper examines the performance of ridge regression in reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces in the presence of noise that exhibits a finite number of higher

dominant subgaussian component allows to achieve convergence rates that have
previously only been derived under subexponential noise - a prevalent
assumption in related work from the last two decades. These rates are optimal
under standard eigenvalue decay conditions, demonstrating the asymptotic
robustness of regularized least squares against heavy-tailed noise. Our
derivations are based on a Fuk-Nagaev inequality for Hilbert-space valued
random variables.

evaluated the ability of ABBA to achieve better time-in-range (TIR) for
individuals with T1D and T2D, compared to a standard basal-bolus advisor (BBA).
The in-silico test was performed using an FDA-accepted population, including
101 simulated adults with T1D and 101 with T2D. An in-silico evaluation shows
that ABBA significantly improved TIR and significantly reduced both times
below- and above-range, compared to BBA. ABBA's performance continued to
improve over two months, whereas BBA exhibited only modest changes. This
personalised method for adjusting insulin has the potential to further optimise
glycaemic control and support people with T1D and T2D in their daily

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia, is linked
to high morbidity and mortality. In a fast-evolving AF rhythm control treatment
era, predicting AF recurrence after its onset may be crucial to achieve the
optimal therapeutic approach, yet traditional scores like CHADS2-VASc, HATCH,
and APPLE show limited predictive accuracy. Moreover, early diagnosis studies
often rely on codified electronic health record (EHR) data, which may contain
errors and missing information.
  OBJECTIVE: This study aims to predict AF recurrence between one month and two
years after onset by evaluating traditional clinical scores, ML models, and our
LTM approach. Moreover, another objective is to develop a methodology for
integrating structured and unstructured data to enhance tabular dataset
quality.
  METHODS: A tabular dataset was generated by combining structured clinical
data with free-text discharge reports processed through natural language
processing techniques, reducing errors and annotation effort. A total of 1,508
patients with documented AF onset were identified, and models were evaluated on
a manually annotated test set. The proposed approach includes a LTM compared
against traditional clinical scores and ML models.
  RESULTS: The proposed LTM approach achieved the highest predictive
performance, surpassing both traditional clinical scores and ML models.
Additionally, the gender and age bias analyses revealed demographic
disparities.
  CONCLUSION: The integration of structured data and free-text sources resulted
in a high-quality dataset. The findings emphasize the limitations of
traditional clinical scores in predicting AF recurrence and highlight the
potential of ML-based approaches, particularly our LTM model.

Abstract: The pursuit of advanced polymers for energy technologies, spanning
photovoltaics, solid-state batteries, and hydrogen storage, is hindered by
fragmented data ecosystems that fail to capture the hierarchical complexity of
these materials. Polymer science lacks interoperable databases, forcing
reliance on disconnected literature and legacy records riddled with
unstructured formats and irreproducible testing protocols. This fragmentation
stifles machine learning (ML) applications and delays the discovery of
materials critical for global decarbonization. Three systemic barriers compound
the challenge. First, academic-industrial data silos restrict access to
proprietary industrial datasets, while academic publications often omit
critical synthesis details. Second, inconsistent testing methods undermine
cross-study comparability. Third, incomplete metadata in existing databases
limits their utility for training reliable ML models. Emerging solutions
address these gaps through technological and collaborative innovation. Natural
language processing (NLP) tools extract structured polymer data from decades of
literature, while high-throughput robotic platforms generate self-consistent
datasets via autonomous experimentation. Central to these advances is the
adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles,
adapted to polymer-specific ontologies, ensuring machine-readability and
reproducibility. Future breakthroughs hinge on cultural shifts toward open
science, accelerated by decentralized data markets and autonomous laboratories
that merge robotic experimentation with real-time ML validation. By addressing
data fragmentation through technological innovation, collaborative governance,
and ethical stewardship, the polymer community can transform bottlenecks into
accelerants.

Abstract: Controlled synthesis of materials with specified atomic structures underpins
technological advances yet remains reliant on iterative, trial-and-error
approaches. Nanoparticles (NPs), whose atomic arrangement dictates their
emergent properties, are particularly challenging to synthesise due to numerous
tunable parameters. Here, we introduce an autonomous approach explicitly
targeting synthesis of atomic-scale structures. Our method autonomously designs
synthesis protocols by matching real time experimental total scattering (TS)
and pair distribution function (PDF) data to simulated target patterns, without
requiring prior synthesis knowledge. We demonstrate this capability at a
synchrotron, successfully synthesising two structurally distinct gold NPs: 5 nm
decahedral and 10 nm face-centred cubic structures. Ultimately, specifying a
simulated target scattering pattern, thus representing a bespoke atomic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型仅关注形状预测，忽略了接触和张力约束，可能导致物体和机器人损坏。

Method: 结合预测模型（形状和张力）和基于多项式区域的实时轨迹优化器，强制执行安全约束。

Result: 在模拟线束装配任务中，相比现有方法，实现了更高的任务成功率且无安全违规。

Conclusion: 该方法在接触丰富的环境中实现了稳健且安全的DLO操作。

Abstract: Manipulating deformable linear objects (DLOs) is challenging due to their
complex dynamics and the need for safe interaction in contact-rich
environments. Most existing models focus on shape prediction alone and fail to
account for contact and tension constraints, which can lead to damage to both
the DLO and the robot. In this work, we propose a certifiably safe motion
planning and control framework for DLO manipulation. At the core of our method
is a predictive model that jointly estimates the DLO's future shape and
tension. These predictions are integrated into a real-time trajectory optimizer
based on polynomial zonotopes, allowing us to enforce safety constraints
throughout the execution. We evaluate our framework on a simulated wire harness
assembly task using a 7-DOF robotic arm. Compared to state-of-the-art methods,
our approach achieves a higher task success rate while avoiding all safety
violations. The results demonstrate that our method enables robust and safe DLO
manipulation in contact-rich environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核量子效应（NQEs）对材料性质有显著影响，但传统方法（如经验势或量子力学计算）在精度和效率上存在不足。机器学习势能提供了一种平衡方案。

Method: 开发了一个接口，将MLIP-2软件包中的MTPs与i-PI软件包的PIMD计算集成，用于主动学习势能和研究NQEs对材料性质的影响。

Result: MTP-PIMD方法在锂氢化物（LiH）和硅（Si）系统中表现出高精度，与实验数据和其他计算方法（如MatterSim）一致。

Conclusion: MTP-PIMD方法为高效准确地模拟NQEs提供了有效工具，适用于材料科学研究。

Abstract: Accounting for nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) can significantly alter
material properties at finite temperatures. Atomic modeling using the
path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) method can fully account for such
effects, but requires computationally efficient and accurate models of
interatomic interactions. Empirical potentials are fast but may lack sufficient
accuracy, whereas quantum-mechanical calculations are highly accurate but
computationally expensive. Machine-learned interatomic potentials offer a
solution to this challenge, providing near-quantum-mechanical accuracy while
maintaining high computational efficiency compared to density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. In this context, an interface was developed to integrate
moment tensor potentials (MTPs) from the MLIP-2 software package into PIMD
calculations using the i-PI software package. This interface was then applied
to active learning of potentials and to investigate the influence of NQEs on
material properties, namely the temperature dependence of lattice parameters
and thermal expansion coefficients, as well as radial distribution functions,
for lithium hydride (LiH) and silicon (Si) systems. The results were compared
with experimental data, quasi-harmonic approximation calculations, and
predictions from the universal machine learning force field MatterSim. These
comparisons demonstrated the high accuracy and effectiveness of the MTP-PIMD
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RRAM-based CIM软件项目仅关注单一功能（如编译或模拟）且依赖传统8位量化的局限性。

Conclusion: CIM-Explorer为RRAM交叉阵列上的BNN和TNN推理提供了全面的设计支持。

Abstract: Using Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) crossbars in Computing-in-Memory
(CIM) architectures offers a promising solution to overcome the von Neumann
bottleneck. Due to non-idealities like cell variability, RRAM crossbars are
often operated in binary mode, utilizing only two states: Low Resistive State
(LRS) and High Resistive State (HRS). Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) and Ternary
Neural Networks (TNNs) are well-suited for this hardware due to their efficient
mapping. Existing software projects for RRAM-based CIM typically focus on only
one aspect: compilation, simulation, or Design Space Exploration (DSE).
Moreover, they often rely on classical 8 bit quantization. To address these
limitations, we introduce CIM-Explorer, a modular toolkit for optimizing BNN
and TNN inference on RRAM crossbars. CIM-Explorer includes an end-to-end
compiler stack, multiple mapping options, and simulators, enabling a DSE flow
for accuracy estimation across different crossbar parameters and mappings.
CIM-Explorer can accompany the entire design process, from early accuracy
estimation for specific crossbar parameters, to selecting an appropriate
mapping, and compiling BNNs and TNNs for a finalized crossbar chip. In DSE case
studies, we demonstrate the expected accuracy for various mappings and crossbar
parameters. CIM-Explorer can be found on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在目标方向已知且静态时表现优异，但在空间动态场景（如移动说话者交叉）中因时变空间特征和模糊性而表现不佳。手动跟踪移动说话者不切实际，因此需开发不依赖精确时间方向线索的方法。

Method: 提出弱引导提取方法，仅依赖目标初始位置，结合深度跟踪算法和联合训练策略，在合成数据集上进行训练。

Result: 方法能有效解决空间模糊性，性能甚至优于不匹配的强引导提取方法。

Conclusion: 弱引导方法在空间动态场景中具有优势，无需精确时间方向线索即可实现高效语音提取。

Abstract: Recent speaker extraction methods using deep non-linear spatial filtering
perform exceptionally well when the target direction is known and stationary.
However, spatially dynamic scenarios are considerably more challenging due to
time-varying spatial features and arising ambiguities, e.g. when moving
speakers cross. While in a static scenario it may be easy for a user to point
to the target's direction, manually tracking a moving speaker is impractical.
Instead of relying on accurate time-dependent directional cues, which we refer
to as strong guidance, in this paper we propose a weakly guided extraction
method solely depending on the target's initial position to cope with spatial
dynamic scenarios. By incorporating our own deep tracking algorithm and
developing a joint training strategy on a synthetic dataset, we demonstrate the
proficiency of our approach in resolving spatial ambiguities and even
outperform a mismatched, but strongly guided extraction method.

Conclusion: 研究为伊朗野火管理提供了新见解，强调了人为因素的重要性，并识别了高风险区域。

Abstract: This study investigates the multifaceted factors influencing wildfire risk in
Iran, focusing on the interplay between climatic conditions and human
activities. Utilizing advanced remote sensing, geospatial information system
(GIS) processing techniques such as cloud computing, and machine learning
algorithms, this research analyzed the impact of climatic parameters,
topographic features, and human-related factors on wildfire susceptibility
assessment and prediction in Iran. Multiple scenarios were developed for this
purpose based on the data sampling strategy. The findings revealed that
climatic elements such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
significantly contribute to wildfire susceptibility, while human
activities-particularly population density and proximity to powerlines-also
played a crucial role. Furthermore, the seasonal impact of each parameter was
separately assessed during warm and cold seasons. The results indicated that
human-related factors, rather than climatic variables, had a more prominent
influence during the seasonal analyses. This research provided new insights
into wildfire dynamics in Iran by generating high-resolution wildfire
susceptibility maps using advanced machine learning classifiers. The generated
maps identified high risk areas, particularly in the central Zagros region, the
northeastern Hyrcanian Forest, and the northern Arasbaran forest, highlighting
the urgent need for effective fire management strategies.

Abstract: Cometary activity is a compelling subject of study, with thermophysical
models playing a pivotal role in its understanding. However, traditional
numerical solutions for small body thermophysical models are computationally
intensive, posing challenges for investigations requiring high-resolution or
repetitive modeling. To address this limitation, we employed a machine learning
approach to develop ThermoONet - a neural network designed to predict the
temperature and water ice sublimation flux of comets. Performance evaluations
indicate that ThermoONet achieves a low average error in subsurface temperature
of approximately 2% relative to the numerical simulation, while reducing
computational time by nearly six orders of magnitude. We applied ThermoONet to
model the water activity of comets 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and
21P/Giacobini-Zinner. By successfully fitting the water production rate curves
of these comets, as obtained by the Rosetta mission and the SOHO telescope,
respectively, we demonstrate the network's effectiveness and efficiency.
Furthermore, when combined with a global optimization algorithm, ThermoONet
proves capable of retrieving the physical properties of target bodies.

Abstract: This work studies the expressivity of ReLU neural networks with a focus on
their depth. A sequence of previous works showed that $\lceil \log_2(n+1)
\rceil$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all continuous piecewise linear
(CPWL) functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella
(NeurIPS'21) conjectured that this result is optimal in the sense that there
are CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, like the maximum function, that require
this depth. We disprove the conjecture and show that
$\lceil\log_3(n-1)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all CPWL
functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  A key step in the proof is that ReLU neural networks with two hidden layers
can exactly represent the maximum function of five inputs. More generally, we
show that $\lceil\log_3(n-2)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute
the maximum of $n\geq 4$ numbers. Our constructions almost match the
$\lceil\log_3(n)\rceil$ lower bound of Averkov, Hojny, and Merkert (ICLR'25) in
the special case of ReLU networks with weights that are decimal fractions. The
constructions have a geometric interpretation via polyhedral subdivisions of
the simplex into ``easier'' polytopes.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural network interatomic potentials have emerged as a
promising research direction. However, popular deep learning models often lack
auxiliary constraints grounded in physical laws, which could accelerate
training and improve fidelity through physics-based regularization. In this
work, we introduce $\Phi$-Module, a universal plugin module that enforces
Poisson's equation within the message-passing framework to learn electrostatic
interactions in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, each atom-wise
representation is encouraged to satisfy a discretized Poisson's equation,
making it possible to acquire a potential $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ and a
corresponding charge density $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ linked to the learnable
Laplacian eigenbasis coefficients of a given molecular graph. We then derive an
electrostatic energy term, crucial for improved total energy predictions. This
approach integrates seamlessly into any existing neural potential with
insignificant computational overhead. Experiments on the OE62 and MD22
benchmarks confirm that models combined with $\Phi$-Module achieve robust
improvements over baseline counterparts. For OE62 error reduction ranges from
4.5\% to 17.8\%, and for MD22, baseline equipped with $\Phi$-Module achieves
best results on 5 out of 14 cases. Our results underscore how embedding a
first-principles constraint in neural interatomic potentials can significantly
improve performance while remaining hyperparameter-friendly, memory-efficient
and lightweight in training. Code will be available at
