### [1] [Guiding Giants: Lightweight Controllers for Weighted Activation Steering in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20309)
*Amr Hegazy,Mostafa Elhoushi,Amr Alanwar*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 90.0

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级、可训练的控制器网络，用于在推理时动态调整LLM的行为，避免生成不安全内容，无需微调模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成不安全内容或违反安全指南的问题，避免昂贵的微调。

Method: 使用控制器网络观察中间激活，预测全局缩放因子和层特定权重，动态调整预计算的“拒绝方向”向量。

Result: 在ToxicChat和In-The-Wild Jailbreak Prompts等基准测试中，显著提高了拒绝率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、自适应的方式，在推理时对LLM行为进行细粒度控制。

Abstract: Controlling undesirable Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors, such as the
generation of unsafe content or failing to adhere to safety guidelines, often
relies on costly fine-tuning. Activation steering provides an alternative for
inference-time control, but existing methods typically lack fine-grained,
adaptive mechanisms. We introduce a novel approach using a lightweight,
trainable controller network integrated during inference. This controller
network observes specific intermediate LLM activations and predicts both a
global scaling factor and layer-specific weights. The predicted global scaling
factor and layer-specific weights then dynamically modulate the intensity of a
steering patch, derived from a pre-computed "refusal direction" vector, applied
across the LLM's layers during generation. Trained on activations from both
harmful and benign prompts, our controller learns to discriminatively apply
nuanced, layer-aware interventions, activating steering primarily for harmful
inputs. Experiments using safety benchmarks like ToxicChat & In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts demonstrate that our weighted steering controller
significantly increases refusal rates compared to the base LLM, achieving
targeted behavioral modification without altering the original model
parameters. Our experiments with Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.2-1B & Mistral-7B show
our approach outperforms existing methods, presenting an efficient and adaptive
method for fine-grained control over LLM behavior at inference time.

*Yukun Zhang,Qi Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 90.0

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度流形对齐框架，用于分解LLM的潜在空间，提升可解释性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs性能强大，但其内部推理过程不透明，限制了在关键应用中的可解释性和信任度。

Method: 通过多尺度流形对齐框架，将潜在空间分解为全局、中间和局部语义流形，并引入跨尺度映射函数，结合几何对齐和信息保留。

Result: 理论分析表明对齐误差（KL散度）在温和假设下可被限制，框架能统一解释LLMs的多尺度语义结构。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了LLMs的可解释性，支持如偏差检测和鲁棒性增强等应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong
performance, yet their internal reasoning remains opaque, limiting
interpretability and trust in critical applications. We propose a novel
Multi_Scale Manifold Alignment framework that decomposes the latent space into
global, intermediate, and local semantic manifolds capturing themes, context,
and word-level details. Our method introduces cross_scale mapping functions
that jointly enforce geometric alignment (e.g., Procrustes analysis) and
information preservation (via mutual information constraints like MINE or VIB).
We further incorporate curvature regularization and hyperparameter tuning for
stable optimization. Theoretical analysis shows that alignment error, measured
by KL divergence, can be bounded under mild assumptions. This framework offers
a unified explanation of how LLMs structure multi-scale semantics, advancing
interpretability and enabling applications such as bias detection and
robustness enhancement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSLIM是一种新颖的多目标对齐方法，通过单一奖励模型和策略模型处理多样化目标，无需在SFT阶段进行偏好训练，显著减少GPU资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LLM多目标对齐方法需要多个策略或奖励模型的问题，提供更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用多头部奖励模型对问答对进行分类，并通过映射函数将分类结果转化为奖励分数，优化策略模型。

Result: 在多个多目标基准测试中表现优异，且计算资源需求显著低于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOSLIM为LLM多目标对齐提供了一种高效且灵活的方法，适用于大规模模型。

Abstract: The multi-objective alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential
for ensuring foundational models conform to diverse human preferences. Current
research in this field typically involves either multiple policies or multiple
reward models customized for various preferences, or the need to train a
preference-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model. In this work, we
introduce a novel multi-objective alignment method, MOSLIM, which utilizes a
single reward model and policy model to address diverse objectives. MOSLIM
provides a flexible way to control these objectives through prompting and does
not require preference training during SFT phase, allowing thousands of
off-the-shelf models to be directly utilized within this training framework.
MOSLIM leverages a multi-head reward model that classifies question-answer
pairs instead of scoring them and then optimize policy model with a scalar
reward derived from a mapping function that converts classification results
from reward model into reward scores. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
proposed method across several multi-objective benchmarks and conduct ablation
studies on various reward model sizes and policy optimization methods. The
MOSLIM method outperforms current multi-objective approaches in most results
while requiring significantly fewer GPU computing resources compared with
existing policy optimization methods.

### [4] [HAMburger: Accelerating LLM Inference via Token Smashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20438)
*Jingyu Liu,Ce Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 90.0

TL;DR: HAMburger是一种层次自回归模型，通过优化KV缓存和计算资源分配，显著提升LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理中每个token需要一次前向传递和KV缓存，效率低下。HAMburger旨在通过非均匀计算和存储分配提升效率。

Method: 引入HAMburger模型，结合组合嵌入器和微步解码器，将多个token压缩为单个KV缓存，并支持每个步骤生成多个token。

Result: KV缓存计算减少2倍，吞吐量提升2倍，同时保持短长上下文任务的质量。

Conclusion: HAMburger探索了计算和内存高效且硬件无关的推理方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference
requires a holistic optimization on algorithms, systems, and hardware. However,
very few works have fundamentally changed the generation pattern: each token
needs one forward pass and one KV cache. This can be sub-optimal because we
found that LLMs are extremely capable of self-identifying the exact dose of
information that a single KV cache can store, and many tokens can be generated
confidently without global context. Based on this insight, we introduce
HAMburger, a Hierarchically Auto-regressive Model that redefines resource
allocation in LLMs by moving beyond uniform computation and storage per token
during inference. Stacking a compositional embedder and a micro-step decoder in
between a base LLM, HAMburger smashes multiple tokens into a single KV and
generates several tokens per step. Additionally, HAMburger functions as a
speculative decoding framework where it can blindly trust self-drafted tokens.
As a result, HAMburger shifts the growth of KV cache and forward FLOPs from
linear to sub-linear with respect to output length, and adjusts its inference
speed based on query perplexity and output structure. Extensive evaluations
show that HAMburger reduces the KV cache computation by up to 2$\times$ and
achieves up to 2$\times$ TPS, while maintaining quality in both short- and
long-context tasks. Our method explores an extremely challenging inference
regime that requires both computation- and memory-efficiency with a
hardware-agnostic design.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在微调过程中先验知识对校准的影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出CogCalib框架，根据模型先验知识应用针对性学习策略。

Result: CogCalib显著改善了校准，ECE平均降低57%，且不影响性能。

Conclusion: CogCalib提升了LLMs的可靠性和客观性，适用于关键人机交互应用。

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) often demonstrate poor calibration,
with their confidence scores misaligned with actual performance. While
calibration has been extensively studied in models trained from scratch, the
impact of LLMs' prior knowledge on calibration during fine-tuning remains
understudied. Our research reveals that LLMs' prior knowledge causes potential
poor calibration due to the ubiquitous presence of known data in real-world
fine-tuning, which appears harmful for calibration. Specifically, data aligned
with LLMs' prior knowledge would induce overconfidence, while new knowledge
improves calibration. Our findings expose a tension: LLMs' encyclopedic
knowledge, while enabling task versatility, undermines calibration through
unavoidable knowledge overlaps. To address this, we propose CogCalib, a
cognition-aware framework that applies targeted learning strategies according
to the model's prior knowledge. Experiments across 7 tasks using 3 LLM families
prove that CogCalib significantly improves calibration while maintaining
performance, achieving an average 57\% reduction in ECE compared to standard
fine-tuning in Llama3-8B. These improvements generalize well to out-of-domain
tasks, enhancing the objectivity and reliability of domain-specific LLMs, and
making them more trustworthy for critical human-AI interaction applications.

Result: 在14个目标和6个基准测试中的200种不同偏好上，HoE表现优于15个基线方法。

Conclusion: HoE是一种高效且灵活的方法，能够在不重新训练模型的情况下实现多目标对齐。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously satisfy multiple
objectives remains a significant challenge, especially given the diverse and
often conflicting nature of human preferences. Existing alignment methods
struggle to balance trade-offs effectively, often requiring costly retraining
or yielding suboptimal results across the Pareto frontier of preferences. In
this paper, we introduce \textit{HoE}(Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts), a
\textit{lightweight}, \textit{parameter-efficient}, and \textit{plug-and-play}
approach that eliminates the need for model training, while enabling LLMs to
adapt across the entire Pareto frontier and accommodate diverse user
preferences. In particular, \textit{HoE} consists of three hierarchical
components: LoRA Experts, Router Experts and Preference Routing, reaching
optimal Pareto frontiers and achieving a trade-off between parameter size,
training cost, and performance. We evaluate \textit{HoE} across various tasks
on 14 objectives and 200 different preferences among 6 benchmarks,
demonstrating superior performance over 15 recent baselines. Code is available

Method: 通过分析Transformer残差流中的线性特征，研究LLMs对实体-关系-属性三元组的正确性判断能力，并探讨上下文扰动和模型规模的影响。

Result: LLMs在生成时能够通过内部线性特征判断事实正确性，这种能力在训练过程中快速出现并在中间层达到峰值。

Conclusion: LLMs具有内在的自我监控能力，这有助于提升其可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Factual incorrectness in generated content is one of the primary concerns in
ubiquitous deployment of large language models (LLMs). Prior findings suggest
LLMs can (sometimes) detect factual incorrectness in their generated content
(i.e., fact-checking post-generation). In this work, we provide evidence
supporting the presence of LLMs' internal compass that dictate the correctness
of factual recall at the time of generation. We demonstrate that for a given
subject entity and a relation, LLMs internally encode linear features in the
Transformer's residual stream that dictate whether it will be able to recall
the correct attribute (that forms a valid entity-relation-attribute triplet).
This self-awareness signal is robust to minor formatting variations. We
investigate the effects of context perturbation via different example selection
strategies. Scaling experiments across model sizes and training dynamics
highlight that self-awareness emerges rapidly during training and peaks in
intermediate layers. These findings uncover intrinsic self-monitoring
capabilities within LLMs, contributing to their interpretability and
reliability.

Motivation: MoE模型中专家激活不均衡导致系统效率低下，尤其是在多设备并行运行时。

Method: 引入MoGE，通过专家分组和负载均衡优化MoE架构，并在Ascend NPUs上实现Pangu Pro MoE模型。

Result: MoGE显著提升了专家负载均衡和执行效率，Pangu Pro MoE在推理性能上优于同类密集模型。

Conclusion: MoGE是一种高效的MoE优化方法，Ascend NPUs能够支持大规模并行训练，使其在100B参数以下模型中表现优异。

Abstract: The surgence of Mixture of Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models promises a
small price of execution cost for a much larger model parameter count and
learning capacity, because only a small fraction of parameters are activated
for each input token. However, it is commonly observed that some experts are
activated far more often than others, leading to system inefficiency when
running the experts on different devices in parallel. Therefore, we introduce
Mixture of Grouped Experts (MoGE), which groups the experts during selection
and balances the expert workload better than MoE in nature. It constrains
tokens to activate an equal number of experts within each predefined expert
group. When a model execution is distributed on multiple devices, this
architectural design ensures a balanced computational load across devices,
significantly enhancing throughput, particularly for the inference phase.
Further, we build Pangu Pro MoE on Ascend NPUs, a sparse model based on MoGE
with 72 billion total parameters, 16 billion of which are activated for each
token. The configuration of Pangu Pro MoE is optimized for Ascend 300I Duo and
800I A2 through extensive system simulation studies. Our experiments indicate
that MoGE indeed leads to better expert load balancing and more efficient
execution for both model training and inference on Ascend NPUs. The inference
performance of Pangu Pro MoE achieves 1148 tokens/s per card and can be further
improved to 1528 tokens/s per card by speculative acceleration, outperforming
comparable 32B and 72B Dense models. Furthermore, we achieve an excellent
cost-to-performance ratio for model inference on Ascend 300I Duo.Our studies
show that Ascend NPUs are capable of training Pangu Pro MoE with massive
parallelization to make it a leading model within the sub-100B total parameter
class, outperforming prominent open-source models like GLM-Z1-32B and
Qwen3-32B.

Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Test2SQL) is a longstanding challenge
at the intersection of natural language understanding and structured data
access. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved fluency
in SQL generation, producing correct and executable SQL--particularly for
complex queries--remains a bottleneck. We present Arctic-Text2SQL-R1, a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework and model family designed to generate
accurate, executable SQL using a lightweight reward signal based solely on
execution correctness. Our approach avoids brittle intermediate supervision and
complex reward shaping, promoting stable training and alignment with the end
task. Combined with carefully curated data, strong supervised initialization,
and effective training practices, Arctic-Text2SQL-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
execution accuracy across six diverse Test2SQL benchmarks, including the top
position on the BIRD leaderboard. Notably, our 7B model outperforms prior
70B-class systems, highlighting the framework's scalability and efficiency. We
further demonstrate inference-time robustness through simple extensions like
value retrieval and majority voting. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
offer both positive and negative insights, providing practical guidance for
future Test2SQL research.

Result: DyVec在性能上优于少样本ICL、LoRA和现有ICV基线。

Conclusion: DyVec为推理时任务适应提供了轻量级且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In-Context derived Vector (ICV) methods extract task-relevant representations
from large language models (LLMs) and reinject them during inference, achieving
comparable performance to few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) without repeated
demonstration processing. However, existing ICV methods remain sensitive to
ICL-specific factors, often use coarse or semantically fragmented
representations as the source of the vector, and rely on heuristic-based
injection positions, limiting their applicability.
  To address these issues, we propose Dynamic Vector (DyVec), which
incorporates an Exhaustive Query Rotation (EQR) strategy to extract robust
semantically aggregated latent representations by mitigating variance
introduced by ICL. It then applies Dynamic Latent Segmentation and Injection to
adaptively partition representations based on task complexity and leverages
REINFORCE-based optimization to learn optimal injection positions for each
segment.
  Experiments results show that DyVec outperforms few-shot ICL, LoRA, and prior
ICV baselines. Further analysis highlights the effectiveness of dynamically
segmenting and injecting semantically aggregated latent representations. DyVec
provides a lightweight and data-efficient solution for inference-time task
adaptation.

Abstract: Long text classification is challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) due

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach using only the most relevant text

large context LLMs. We begin by splitting clinical documents into smaller
chunks, converting them into vector embeddings, and storing these in a FAISS
index. We then retrieve the top 4,000 words most pertinent to the
classification query and feed these consolidated segments into an LLM. We
evaluated three LLMs (GPT4o, LLaMA, and Mistral) on a surgical complication
identification task. Metrics such as AUC ROC, precision, recall, and F1 showed
no statistically significant differences between the RAG based approach and
whole-text processing (p > 0.05p > 0.05). These findings indicate that RAG can
significantly reduce token usage without sacrificing classification accuracy,
providing a scalable and cost effective solution for analyzing lengthy clinical

Abstract: Precise control over language model generation is vital for ensuring both
safety and reliability. Although prompt engineering and steering are commonly
used to intervene in model behaviors, the vast number of parameters in models
often results in highly intertwined internal representations. This
interdependency can limit control precision and sometimes lead to unintended
side effects. Recent research has explored the use of sparse autoencoders (SAE)
to disentangle knowledge in high-dimensional spaces for steering. However,
these applications have been limited to toy tasks owing to the nontrivial issue
of locating atomic knowledge components. In this paper, we propose Steering
Target Atoms (STA), a novel method that isolates and manipulates disentangled
knowledge components to enhance safety. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering
exhibits superior robustness and flexibility, particularly in adversarial
scenarios. We also apply the steering strategy to the large reasoning model,
confirming its effectiveness in precise reasoning control.

Conclusion: GG提供了一种高效且实用的测试时间缩放方法，显著降低了计算成本，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning often incur substantial computational costs, primarily due to
extensive reliance on external Process Reward Models (PRMs) or sampling methods
like Best-of-N (BoN). This paper introduces Guided by Gut (GG), an efficient
self-guided TTS framework that achieves PRM-level performance without costly
external verifier models. Our method employs a lightweight tree search guided
solely by intrinsic LLM signals, token-level confidence and step novelty. One
critical innovation is improving the reliability of internal confidence
estimates via a targeted reinforcement learning fine-tuning phase. Empirical
evaluations on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
GG enables smaller models (e.g., 1.5B parameters) to achieve accuracy matching
or surpassing significantly larger models (e.g., 32B-70B parameters), while
reducing GPU memory usage by up to 10x. Compared to PRM-based methods, GG
achieves comparable accuracy with 8x faster inference speeds and 4-5x lower
memory usage. Additionally, GG reduces KV cache memory usage by approximately
50% compared to the BoN strategy, facilitating more efficient and practical
deployment of TTS techniques.

Conclusion: LAQ与现有方法互补，可灵活结合以进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value cache (KV cache) to accelerate
decoding by reducing redundant computations. However, the KV cache memory usage
grows substantially with longer text sequences, posing challenges for efficient
deployment. Existing KV cache eviction methods prune tokens using
prefilling-stage attention scores, causing inconsistency with actual inference
queries, especially under tight memory budgets. In this paper, we propose
Lookahead Q-Cache (LAQ), a novel eviction framework that generates low-cost
pseudo lookahead queries to better approximate the true decoding-stage queries.
By using these lookahead queries as the observation window for importance
estimation, LAQ achieves more consistent and accurate KV cache eviction aligned
with real inference scenarios. Experimental results on LongBench and
Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks show that LAQ outperforms existing methods
across various budget levels, achieving a 1 $\sim$ 4 point improvement on
LongBench under limited cache budget. Moreover, LAQ is complementary to
existing approaches and can be flexibly combined to yield further improvements.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够显著提升蒸馏模型的性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用教师模型的分布稀疏性，时间差分学习框架为语言模型蒸馏提供了更高效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models have led to significant progress across many NLP tasks,
although their massive sizes often incur substantial computational costs.
Distillation has become a common practice to compress these large and highly
capable models into smaller, more efficient ones. Many existing language model
distillation methods can be viewed as behavior cloning from the perspective of
imitation learning or inverse reinforcement learning. This viewpoint has
inspired subsequent studies that leverage (inverse) reinforcement learning
techniques, including variations of behavior cloning and temporal difference
learning methods. Rather than proposing yet another specific temporal
difference method, we introduce a general framework for temporal
difference-based distillation by exploiting the distributional sparsity of the
teacher model. Specifically, it is often observed that language models assign
most probability mass to a small subset of tokens. Motivated by this
observation, we design a temporal difference learning framework that operates
on a reduced action space (a subset of vocabulary), and demonstrate how
practical algorithms can be derived and the resulting performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在专业领域（如计算机科学）的表现，以评估其实用性并指导未来发展。

Method: 评估了ChatGPT-4、Gemini 1.0 Advanced、Claude 3 Sonnet和Le Chat Mistral Large等模型在2022-2023年POSCOMP考试中的表现，并扩展分析了更新的模型在2022-2024年考试中的表现。

Result: ChatGPT-4在文本任务上表现最佳，超越了人类考生；新模型进一步提升了性能，全面超越人类表现。

Conclusion: LLMs在专业领域的文本任务中具有潜力，但图像解释仍需改进。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
expanded the capabilities of artificial intelligence in natural language
processing tasks. Despite this progress, their performance in specialized
domains such as computer science remains relatively unexplored. Understanding
the proficiency of LLMs in these domains is critical for evaluating their
practical utility and guiding future developments. The POSCOMP, a prestigious
Brazilian examination used for graduate admissions in computer science promoted
by the Brazlian Computer Society (SBC), provides a challenging benchmark. This
study investigates whether LLMs can match or surpass human performance on the
POSCOMP exam. Four LLMs - ChatGPT-4, Gemini 1.0 Advanced, Claude 3 Sonnet, and
Le Chat Mistral Large - were initially evaluated on the 2022 and 2023 POSCOMP
exams. The assessments measured the models' proficiency in handling complex
questions typical of the exam. LLM performance was notably better on text-based
questions than on image interpretation tasks. In the 2022 exam, ChatGPT-4 led
with 57 correct answers out of 69 questions, followed by Gemini 1.0 Advanced
(49), Le Chat Mistral (48), and Claude 3 Sonnet (44). Similar trends were
observed in the 2023 exam. ChatGPT-4 achieved the highest performance,
surpassing all students who took the POSCOMP 2023 exam. LLMs, particularly
ChatGPT-4, show promise in text-based tasks on the POSCOMP exam, although image
interpretation remains a challenge. Given the rapid evolution of LLMs, we
expanded our analysis to include more recent models - o1, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and o3-mini-high - evaluated on the 2022-2024 POSCOMP exams.
These newer models demonstrate further improvements and consistently surpass
both the average and top-performing human participants across all three years.

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Manifold Evolution Theory (DMET),a unified framework
that models large language model generation as a controlled dynamical system
evolving on a low_dimensional semantic manifold. By casting latent_state
updates as discrete time Euler approximations of continuous dynamics, we map
intrinsic energy_driven flows and context_dependent forces onto Transformer
components (residual connections, attention, feed-forward networks). Leveraging
Lyapunov stability theory We define three empirical metrics (state continuity,
clustering quality, topological persistence) that quantitatively link
latent_trajectory properties to text fluency, grammaticality, and semantic
coherence. Extensive experiments across decoding parameters validate DMET's
predictions and yield principled guidelines for balancing creativity and
consistency in text generation.

Abstract: We investigate the existence and persistence of a specific type of gender
bias in some of the popular LLMs and contribute a new benchmark dataset,
RealWorldQuestioning (released on HuggingFace ), developed from real-world
questions across four key domains in business and health contexts: education,
jobs, personal financial management, and general health. We define and study
entropy bias, which we define as a discrepancy in the amount of information
generated by an LLM in response to real questions users have asked. We tested
this using four different LLMs and evaluated the generated responses both
qualitatively and quantitatively by using ChatGPT-4o (as "LLM-as-judge"). Our
analyses (metric-based comparisons and "LLM-as-judge" evaluation) suggest that
there is no significant bias in LLM responses for men and women at a category
level. However, at a finer granularity (the individual question level), there
are substantial differences in LLM responses for men and women in the majority
of cases, which "cancel" each other out often due to some responses being
better for males and vice versa. This is still a concern since typical users of
these tools often ask a specific question (only) as opposed to several varied
ones in each of these common yet important areas of life. We suggest a simple
debiasing approach that iteratively merges the responses for the two genders to
produce a final result. Our approach demonstrates that a simple, prompt-based
debiasing strategy can effectively debias LLM outputs, thus producing responses
with higher information content than both gendered variants in 78% of the
cases, and consistently achieving a balanced integration in the remaining
cases.

Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, existing works inevitably rely on high-quality instructions and
verifiable rewards for effective training, both of which are often difficult to
obtain in specialized domains. In this paper, we propose Self-play
Reinforcement Learning(SeRL) to bootstrap LLM training with limited initial
data. Specifically, SeRL comprises two complementary modules: self-instruction
and self-rewarding. The former module generates additional instructions based
on the available data at each training step, employing robust online filtering
strategies to ensure instruction quality, diversity, and difficulty. The latter
module introduces a simple yet effective majority-voting mechanism to estimate
response rewards for additional instructions, eliminating the need for external
annotations. Finally, SeRL performs conventional RL based on the generated
data, facilitating iterative self-play learning. Extensive experiments on
various reasoning benchmarks and across different LLM backbones demonstrate
that the proposed SeRL yields results superior to its counterparts and achieves
performance on par with those obtained by high-quality data with verifiable
rewards. Our code is available at https://github.com/wantbook-book/SeRL.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in mathematical
and logical reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to
memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such
performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations,
demonstrating a lack of robust symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning
process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs
with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively
leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing
reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to
overcome such limitations by generating symbolic reasoning trajectories and
select the high-quality ones using a process reward model automatically tuned
based on Monte Carlo estimation. The trajectories are then employed via
fine-tuning methods to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our
results on logical reasoning benchmarks such as FOLIO and LogicAsker show the
effectiveness of the proposed method with large gains on frontier and
open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification
reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories
enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of
symbolically-guided process supervision in alleviating the effect of
memorization on LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: GraphGen为LLM微调提供了一种更可靠、全面的数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs) typically requires substantial
amounts of high-quality supervised data, which is both costly and
labor-intensive to acquire. While synthetic data generation has emerged as a
promising solution, existing approaches frequently suffer from factual
inaccuracies, insufficient long-tail coverage, simplistic knowledge structures,
and homogenized outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphGen, a
knowledge graph-guided framework designed for three key question-answering (QA)
scenarios: atomic QA, aggregated QA, and multi-hop QA. It begins by
constructing a fine-grained knowledge graph from the source text. It then
identifies knowledge gaps in LLMs using the expected calibration error metric,
prioritizing the generation of QA pairs that target high-value, long-tail
knowledge. Furthermore, GraphGen incorporates multi-hop neighborhood sampling
to capture complex relational information and employs style-controlled
generation to diversify the resulting QA data. Experimental results on
knowledge-intensive tasks under closed-book settings demonstrate that GraphGen
outperforms conventional synthetic data methods, offering a more reliable and
comprehensive solution to the data scarcity challenge in supervised
fine-tuning. The code and data are publicly available at

Motivation: Address the limited language support of LLMs by exploring unsupervised learning for low-resource languages.

Method: Use ICL on four endangered languages, comparing probability-based and instruction-based approaches.

Result: ICL enhances performance, with probability-based methods outperforming instruction-based ones, achieving ASR results comparable to dedicated models.

Conclusion: ICL enables LLMs to learn new languages effectively without losing original capabilities.

Abstract: With approximately 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, current large language
models (LLMs) support only a small subset. Prior research indicates LLMs can
learn new languages for certain tasks without supervised data. We extend this
investigation to speech recognition, investigating whether LLMs can learn
unseen, low-resource languages through in-context learning (ICL). With
experiments on four diverse endangered languages that LLMs have not been
trained on, we find that providing more relevant text samples enhances
performance in both language modelling and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
tasks. Furthermore, we show that the probability-based approach outperforms the
traditional instruction-based approach in language learning. Lastly, we show
ICL enables LLMs to achieve ASR performance that is comparable to or even
surpasses dedicated language models trained specifically for these languages,
while preserving the original capabilities of the LLMs.

Abstract: Today, large language models are widely used as judges to evaluate responses
from other language models. Hence, it is imperative to benchmark and improve
these LLM-judges on real-world language model usage: a typical human-assistant
conversation is lengthy, and shows significant diversity in topics, intents,
and requirements across turns, e.g. social interactions, task requests,
feedback. We present Amulet, a framework that leverages pertinent linguistic
concepts of dialog-acts and maxims to improve the accuracy of LLM-judges on
preference data with complex, multi-turn conversational context. Amulet
presents valuable insights about (a) the communicative structures and intents
present in the conversation (dialog acts), and (b) the satisfaction of
conversational principles (maxims) by the preference responses, and uses them
to make judgments. On four challenging datasets, Amulet shows that (a) humans
frequently (60 to 70 percent of the time) change their intents from one turn of
the conversation to the next, and (b) in 75 percent of instances, the
preference responses can be differentiated via dialog acts and/or maxims,
reiterating the latter's significance in judging such data. Amulet can be used
either as a judge by applying the framework to a single LLM, or integrated into
a jury with different LLM judges; our judges and juries show strong
improvements on relevant baselines for all four datasets.

Result: 实验表明，优化信息对齐目标不仅能提升信息量，还能改善事实性。

Conclusion: 信息对齐机制是提升LLM生成质量的有效方法。

Abstract: Factual completeness is a general term that captures how detailed and
informative a factually correct text is. For instance, the factual sentence
``Barack Obama was born in the United States'' is factually correct, though
less informative than the factual sentence ``Barack Obama was born in Honolulu,
Hawaii, United States''. Despite the known fact that LLMs tend to hallucinate
and generate factually incorrect text, they might also tend to choose to
generate factual text that is indeed factually correct and yet less informative
than other, more informative choices. In this work, we tackle this problem by
proposing an informativeness alignment mechanism. This mechanism takes
advantage of recent factual benchmarks to propose an informativeness alignment
objective. This objective prioritizes answers that are both correct and
informative. A key finding of our work is that when training a model to
maximize this objective or optimize its preference, we can improve not just
informativeness but also factuality.

Abstract: Conventional transformer models typically compress the information from all

their relevance to a particular task. Evaluation across a diverse range of
tasks including emotion recognition (both English and Bangla), irony detection,

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often exhibit factual
inconsistencies across languages, with significantly better performance in
factual recall tasks in English than in other languages. The causes of these
failures, however, remain poorly understood. Using mechanistic analysis
techniques, we uncover the underlying pipeline that LLMs employ, which involves
using the English-centric factual recall mechanism to process multilingual
queries and then translating English answers back into the target language. We
identify two primary sources of error: insufficient engagement of the reliable
English-centric mechanism for factual recall, and incorrect translation from
English back into the target language for the final answer. To address these
vulnerabilities, we introduce two vector interventions, both independent of
languages and datasets, to redirect the model toward better internal paths for
higher factual consistency. Our interventions combined increase the recall
accuracy by over 35 percent for the lowest-performing language. Our findings
demonstrate how mechanistic insights can be used to unlock latent multilingual
capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Processing long contexts has become a critical capability for modern large
language models (LLMs). Existing works leverage agent-based divide-and-conquer
methods for processing long contexts. But these methods face crucial
limitations, including prohibitive accumulated latency and amplified
information loss from excessive agent invocations, and the disruption of
inherent textual dependencies by immoderate partitioning. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-agent framework XpandA (Expand-Agent) coupled with
question-driven workflow and dynamic partitioning for robust long-context
processing. XpandA overcomes these limitations through: 1) dynamic partitioning
of long texts, which adaptively modulates the filling rate of context windows
for input sequences of vastly varying lengths; 2) question-guided protocol to
update flat information ensembles within centralized shared memory,
constructing consistent inter-agent knowledge across partitions; and 3)
selectively replaying specific partitions based on the state-tracking of
question-information couples to promote the resolution of inverted-order
structures across partitions (e.g., flashbacks). We perform a comprehensive
evaluation of XpandA on multiple long-context benchmarks with length varying
from 1k to 1M, demonstrating XpandA's feasibility for processing ultra-long
sequences and its significant effectiveness in enhancing the long-context
capabilities of various LLMs by achieving 20\% improvements and 1.5x inference
speedup over baselines of full-context, RAG and previous agent-based methods.

Conclusion: TLM通过测试时学习有效提升了LLM的领域适应能力。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable emergent
capabilities through extensive pre-training, they still face critical
limitations in generalizing to specialized domains and handling diverse
linguistic variations, known as distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose
a Test-Time Learning (TTL) paradigm for LLMs, namely TLM, which dynamically
adapts LLMs to target domains using only unlabeled test data during testing.
Specifically, we first provide empirical evidence and theoretical insights to
reveal that more accurate predictions from LLMs can be achieved by minimizing
the input perplexity of the unlabeled test data. Based on this insight, we
formulate the Test-Time Learning process of LLMs as input perplexity
minimization, enabling self-supervised enhancement of LLM performance.
Furthermore, we observe that high-perplexity samples tend to be more
informative for model optimization. Accordingly, we introduce a Sample
Efficient Learning Strategy that actively selects and emphasizes these
high-perplexity samples for test-time updates. Lastly, to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting and ensure adaptation stability, we adopt Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
instead of full-parameter optimization, which allows lightweight model updates
while preserving more original knowledge from the model. We introduce the
AdaptEval benchmark for TTL and demonstrate through experiments that TLM
improves performance by at least 20% compared to original LLMs on domain
knowledge adaptation.

Abstract: Steerability, or the ability of large language models (LLMs) to adapt outputs
to align with diverse community-specific norms, perspectives, and communication
styles, is critical for real-world applications but remains under-evaluated. We
introduce Steer-Bench, a benchmark for assessing population-specific steering
using contrasting Reddit communities. Covering 30 contrasting subreddit pairs
across 19 domains, Steer-Bench includes over 10,000 instruction-response pairs
and validated 5,500 multiple-choice question with corresponding silver labels
to test alignment with diverse community norms. Our evaluation of 13 popular
LLMs using Steer-Bench reveals that while human experts achieve an accuracy of
81% with silver labels, the best-performing models reach only around 65%
accuracy depending on the domain and configuration. Some models lag behind
human-level alignment by over 15 percentage points, highlighting significant
gaps in community-sensitive steerability. Steer-Bench is a benchmark to
systematically assess how effectively LLMs understand community-specific
instructions, their resilience to adversarial steering attempts, and their
ability to accurately represent diverse cultural and ideological perspectives.

Motivation: 解决推理增强型大语言模型（RLLMs）在处理简单问题时过度消耗token的问题，提高资源效率。

Method: 提出Self-Route框架，利用轻量级预推理阶段提取能力感知嵌入，并结合Gradient-10K数据集训练路由器。

Result: 在保持推理模型精度的同时，token消耗减少30-55%，适用于不同规模的模型。

Conclusion: Self-Route具有通用性和实用价值，能显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: While reasoning-augmented large language models (RLLMs) significantly enhance
complex task performance through extended reasoning chains, they inevitably
introduce substantial unnecessary token consumption, particularly for simpler
problems where Short Chain-of-Thought (Short CoT) suffices. This overthinking
phenomenon leads to inefficient resource usage without proportional accuracy
gains. To address this issue, we propose Self-Route, a dynamic reasoning
framework that automatically selects between general and reasoning modes based
on model capability estimation. Our approach introduces a lightweight
pre-inference stage to extract capability-aware embeddings from hidden layer
representations, enabling real-time evaluation of the model's ability to solve
problems. We further construct Gradient-10K, a model difficulty
estimation-based dataset with dense complexity sampling, to train the router
for precise capability boundary detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Self-Route achieves comparable accuracy to reasoning models while reducing
token consumption by 30-55\% across diverse benchmarks. The proposed framework
demonstrates consistent effectiveness across models with different parameter
scales and reasoning paradigms, highlighting its general applicability and
practical value.

Result: 在语言建模任务中，思考模型性能与参数翻倍的普通模型相当；在下游任务中，思考增强的Pythia模型显著优于原版。

Abstract: Humans ponder before articulating complex sentence elements, enabling deeper
cognitive processing through focused effort. In this work, we introduce this
pondering process into language models by repeatedly invoking the forward
process within a single token generation step. During pondering, instead of
generating an actual token sampled from the prediction distribution, the model
ponders by yielding a weighted sum of all token embeddings according to the
predicted token distribution. The generated embedding is then fed back as input
for another forward pass. We show that the model can learn to ponder in this
way through self-supervised learning, without any human annotations. Our method
is straightforward and can be seamlessly integrated with various existing
language models. Experiments across three widely used open-source
architectures-GPT-2, Pythia, and LLaMA-and extensive downstream task
evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method. For
language modeling tasks, pondering language models achieve performance
comparable to vanilla models with twice the number of parameters. On 9
downstream benchmarks, our pondering-enhanced Pythia models significantly
outperform the official Pythia models. Notably, pondering-enhanced Pythia-1B is
comparable to TinyLlama-1.1B, which is trained on 10 times more data. The code

Method: DART采用选择性模仿策略，通过解决方案模拟估计步骤适应性。当专家步骤超出学生模型能力时（模仿差距），学生自主探索替代推理路径，受结果一致性约束。

Result: 在多个推理基准和模型规模上验证，DART显著提升了泛化能力和数据效率，优于静态微调。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet aligning such abilities to small language models (SLMs) remains a challenge
due to distributional mismatches and limited model capacity. Existing reasoning
datasets, typically designed for powerful LLMs, often lead to degraded
performance when directly applied to weaker models. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Adaptation of Reasoning Trajectories (DART), a novel data adaptation
framework that bridges the capability gap between expert reasoning trajectories
and diverse SLMs. Instead of uniformly imitating expert steps, DART employs a
selective imitation strategy guided by step-wise adaptability estimation via
solution simulation. When expert steps surpass the student's capacity --
signaled by an Imitation Gap -- the student autonomously explores alternative
reasoning paths, constrained by outcome consistency. We validate DART across
multiple reasoning benchmarks and model scales, demonstrating that it
significantly improves generalization and data efficiency over static
fine-tuning. Our method enhances supervision quality by aligning training
signals with the student's reasoning capabilities, offering a scalable solution
for reasoning alignment in resource-constrained models.

Conclusion: SPA通过有效的中间奖励显著提升了强化学习的训练效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) holds significant promise for training LLM agents
to handle complex, goal-oriented tasks that require multi-step interactions
with external environments. However, a critical challenge when applying RL to
these agentic tasks arises from delayed rewards: feedback signals are typically
available only after the entire task is completed. This makes it non-trivial to
assign delayed rewards to earlier actions, providing insufficient guidance
regarding environmental constraints and hindering agent training. In this work,
we draw on the insight that the ultimate completion of a task emerges from the
cumulative progress an agent makes across individual steps. We propose Stepwise
Progress Attribution (SPA), a general reward redistribution framework that
decomposes the final reward into stepwise contributions, each reflecting its
incremental progress toward overall task completion. To achieve this, we train
a progress estimator that accumulates stepwise contributions over a trajectory
to match the task completion. During policy optimization, we combine the
estimated per-step contribution with a grounding signal for actions executed in
the environment as the fine-grained, intermediate reward for effective agent
training. Extensive experiments on common agent benchmarks (including Webshop,
ALFWorld, and VirtualHome) demonstrate that SPA consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art method in both success rate (+2.5\% on average) and grounding
accuracy (+1.9\% on average). Further analyses demonstrate that our method
remarkably provides more effective intermediate rewards for RL training. Our

this basis, we propose Silencer, a general framework that leverages the

Silencer can suppress self-bias to near zero, significantly improve evaluation

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference

Retrieval, a novel KV cache update strategy that uses the target model's
attention scores to dynamically select relevant context for the draft model.
Extensive evaluations on three long-context understanding datasets show that
SpecExtend accelerates standard tree-based speculative decoding by up to 2.22x

Result: RePS在Gemma模型（2B-27B）上优于现有导向方法，接近提示法的效果，且在抑制任务中表现更优且抗攻击。

Conclusion: RePS为语言模型的导向和抑制提供了可解释且鲁棒的替代方案。

Abstract: Steering methods for language models (LMs) seek to provide fine-grained and
interpretable control over model generations by variously changing model
inputs, weights, or representations to adjust behavior. Recent work has shown
that adjusting weights or representations is often less effective than steering
by prompting, for instance when wanting to introduce or suppress a particular
concept. We demonstrate how to improve representation steering via our new
Reference-free Preference Steering (RePS), a bidirectional
preference-optimization objective that jointly does concept steering and
suppression. We train three parameterizations of RePS and evaluate them on
AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark. On Gemma models with sizes
ranging from 2B to 27B, RePS outperforms all existing steering methods trained
with a language modeling objective and substantially narrows the gap with
prompting -- while promoting interpretability and minimizing parameter count.
In suppression, RePS matches the language-modeling objective on Gemma-2 and
outperforms it on the larger Gemma-3 variants while remaining resilient to
prompt-based jailbreaking attacks that defeat prompting. Overall, our results
suggest that RePS provides an interpretable and robust alternative to prompting
for both steering and suppression.

Abstract: Knowledge editing methods (KEs) are a cost-effective way to update the
factual content of large language models (LLMs), but they pose a dual-use risk.
While KEs are beneficial for updating outdated or incorrect information, they
can be exploited maliciously to implant misinformation or bias. In order to
defend against these types of malicious manipulation, we need robust techniques
that can reliably detect, interpret, and mitigate adversarial edits. This work
investigates the traceability and reversibility of knowledge edits, focusing on
the widely used Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) method. We first show that ROME
introduces distinctive distributional patterns in the edited weight matrices,
which can serve as effective signals for locating the edited weights. Second,
we show that these altered weights can reliably be used to predict the edited
factual relation, enabling partial reconstruction of the modified fact.
Building on this, we propose a method to infer the edited object entity
directly from the modified weights, without access to the editing prompt,
achieving over 95% accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that ROME edits can be
reversed, recovering the model's original outputs with $\geq$ 80% accuracy. Our
findings highlight the feasibility of detecting, tracing, and reversing edits
based on the edited weights, offering a robust framework for safeguarding LLMs
against adversarial manipulations.

Abstract: Long-form question answering (LFQA) presents unique challenges for large
language models, requiring the synthesis of coherent, paragraph-length answers.
While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a promising
solution, existing research struggles with key limitations: the scarcity of
high-quality training data for long-form generation, the compounding risk of
hallucination in extended outputs, and the absence of reliable evaluation
metrics for factual completeness. In this paper, we propose RioRAG, a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that advances long-form RAG through
reinforced informativeness optimization. Our approach introduces two
fundamental innovations to address the core challenges. First, we develop an RL
training paradigm of reinforced informativeness optimization that directly
optimizes informativeness and effectively addresses the slow-thinking deficit
in conventional RAG systems, bypassing the need for expensive supervised data.
Second, we propose a nugget-centric hierarchical reward modeling approach that
enables precise assessment of long-form answers through a three-stage process:
extracting the nugget from every source webpage, constructing a nugget claim
checklist, and computing rewards based on factual alignment. Extensive
experiments on two LFQA benchmarks LongFact and RAGChecker demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our codes are available at

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, concerns about their safe
deployment have also grown. Although alignment mechanisms have been introduced
to deter misuse, they remain vulnerable to carefully designed adversarial
prompts. In this work, we present a scalable attack strategy: intent-hiding
adversarial prompting, which conceals malicious intent through the composition
of skills. We develop a game-theoretic framework to model the interaction
between such attacks and defense systems that apply both prompt and response
filtering. Our analysis identifies equilibrium points and reveals structural
advantages for the attacker. To counter these threats, we propose and analyze a
defense mechanism tailored to intent-hiding attacks. Empirically, we validate
the attack's effectiveness on multiple real-world LLMs across a range of
malicious behaviors, demonstrating clear advantages over existing adversarial
prompting techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have
significantly advanced natural language processing tasks by integrating
external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually rich
responses. To improve the robustness of such systems against noisy retrievals,
Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) has emerged as a widely adopted method.
However, RAFT conditions models to generate answers even in the absence of
reliable knowledge. This behavior undermines their reliability in high-stakes
domains, where acknowledging uncertainty is critical. To address this issue, we
propose Divide-Then-Align (DTA), a post-training approach designed to endow RAG
systems with the ability to respond with "I don't know" when the query is out
of the knowledge boundary of both the retrieved passages and the model's
internal knowledge. DTA divides data samples into four knowledge quadrants and
constructs tailored preference data for each quadrant, resulting in a curated
dataset for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate that DTA effectively balances accuracy with
appropriate abstention, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of
retrieval-augmented systems.

Conclusion: 强调跨多样英语变体的全面语言鲁棒性评估的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly evaluated on Standard American
English (SAE), often overlooking the diversity of global English varieties.
This narrow focus may raise fairness concerns as degraded performance on
non-standard varieties can lead to unequal benefits for users worldwide.
Therefore, it is critical to extensively evaluate the linguistic robustness of
LLMs on multiple non-standard English varieties. We introduce Trans-EnV, a
framework that automatically transforms SAE datasets into multiple English
varieties to evaluate the linguistic robustness. Our framework combines (1)
linguistics expert knowledge to curate variety-specific features and
transformation guidelines from linguistic literature and corpora, and (2)
LLM-based transformations to ensure both linguistic validity and scalability.
Using Trans-EnV, we transform six benchmark datasets into 38 English varieties
and evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal significant
performance disparities, with accuracy decreasing by up to 46.3% on
non-standard varieties. These findings highlight the importance of
comprehensive linguistic robustness evaluation across diverse English

Abstract: Users interacting with large language models (LLMs) under their real
identifiers often unknowingly risk disclosing private information.
Automatically notifying users whether their queries leak privacy and which
phrases leak what private information has therefore become a practical need.
Existing privacy detection methods, however, were designed for different
objectives and application scenarios, typically tagging personally identifiable
information (PII) in anonymous content. In this work, to support the
development and evaluation of privacy detection models for LLM interactions
that are deployable on local user devices, we construct a large-scale
multilingual dataset with 249K user queries and 154K annotated privacy phrases.
In particular, we build an automated privacy annotation pipeline with
cloud-based strong LLMs to automatically extract privacy phrases from dialogue
datasets and annotate leaked information. We also design evaluation metrics at
the levels of privacy leakage, extracted privacy phrase, and privacy
information. We further establish baseline methods using light-weight LLMs with
both tuning-free and tuning-based methods, and report a comprehensive
evaluation of their performance. Evaluation results reveal a gap between

TL;DR: LLM-AT框架自动选择LLM层级以平衡成本与性能，无需训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂NLP任务中如何选择合适的LLM层级以优化成本与性能的问题。

Method: LLM-AT由Starter、Generator和Judge组成，通过迭代升级LLM层级直至获得有效响应。

Result: 实验表明LLM-AT在降低成本的同时保持高性能。

Conclusion: LLM-AT是实际应用中平衡成本与性能的实用解决方案。

Abstract: LLM providers typically offer multiple LLM tiers, varying in performance and
price. As NLP tasks become more complex and modularized, selecting the suitable
LLM tier for each subtask is a key challenge to balance between cost and
performance. To address the problem, we introduce LLM Automatic Transmission
(LLM-AT) framework that automatically selects LLM tiers without training.
LLM-AT consists of Starter, Generator, and Judge. The starter selects the
initial LLM tier expected to solve the given question, the generator produces a
response using the LLM of the selected tier, and the judge evaluates the
validity of the response. If the response is invalid, LLM-AT iteratively
upgrades to a higher-tier model, generates a new response, and re-evaluates
until a valid response is obtained. Additionally, we propose accuracy
estimator, which enables the suitable initial LLM tier selection without
training. Given an input question, accuracy estimator estimates the expected
accuracy of each LLM tier by computing the valid response rate across top-k
similar queries from past inference records. Experiments demonstrate that
LLM-AT achieves superior performance while reducing costs, making it a
practical solution for real-world applications.

Conclusion: RAR有效整合LLM与KG，生成高质量、可解释的推理链，适用于KGQA任务。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks,
yet they often suffer from hallucinations and lack reliable factual grounding.
Meanwhile, knowledge graphs (KGs) provide structured factual knowledge but lack
the flexible reasoning abilities of LLMs. In this paper, we present
Reason-Align-Respond (RAR), a novel framework that systematically integrates
LLM reasoning with knowledge graphs for KGQA. Our approach consists of three
key components: a Reasoner that generates human-like reasoning chains, an
Aligner that maps these chains to valid KG paths, and a Responser that
synthesizes the final answer. We formulate this process as a probabilistic
model and optimize it using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which
iteratively refines the reasoning chains and knowledge paths. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of RAR,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with Hit@1 scores of 93.3% and 91.0% on
WebQSP and CWQ respectively. Human evaluation confirms that RAR generates
high-quality, interpretable reasoning chains well-aligned with KG paths.
Furthermore, RAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization capabilities and
maintains computational efficiency during inference.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
on complex tasks with multimodal context. However, it is still understudied
whether they exhibit modality preference when processing multimodal contexts.
To study this question, we first build a \textbf{MC\textsuperscript{2}}
benchmark under controlled evidence conflict scenarios to systematically
evaluate modality preference, which is the tendency to favor one modality over
another when making decisions based on multimodal conflicting evidence. Our
extensive evaluation reveals that all 18 tested MLLMs generally demonstrate
clear modality bias, and modality preference can be influenced by external
interventions. An in-depth analysis reveals that the preference direction can
be captured within the latent representations of MLLMs. Built on this, we
propose a probing and steering method based on representation engineering to
explicitly control modality preference without additional fine-tuning or
carefully crafted prompts. Our method effectively amplifies modality preference
toward a desired direction and applies to downstream tasks such as
hallucination mitigation and multimodal machine translation, yielding promising
improvements.

Conclusion: 为LLMs可解释性提供新视角，并为针对性训练策略开辟途径。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs), the
process of endowing them with new capabilities--such as mathematical
reasoning--remains largely empirical and opaque. A critical open question is
whether reasoning abilities stem from the entire model, specific modules, or
are merely artifacts of overfitting. In this work, we hypothesize that the
reasoning capabilities in well-trained LLMs are primarily attributed to the
output projection module (oproj) in the Transformer's multi-head self-attention
(MHSA) mechanism. To support this hypothesis, we introduce Stethoscope for
Networks (SfN), a suite of diagnostic tools designed to probe and analyze the
internal behaviors of LLMs. Using SfN, we provide both circumstantial and
empirical evidence suggesting that oproj plays a central role in enabling
reasoning, whereas other modules contribute more to fluent dialogue. These
findings offer a new perspective on LLM interpretability and open avenues for
more targeted training strategies, potentially enabling more efficient and
specialized LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in handling long sequences have facilitated the exploration
of long-context in-context learning (ICL). While much of the existing research
emphasizes performance improvements driven by additional in-context examples,
the influence on the trustworthiness of generated responses remains
underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by investigating how increased
examples influence predictive uncertainty, an essential aspect in
trustworthiness. We begin by systematically quantifying the uncertainty of ICL
with varying shot counts, analyzing the impact of example quantity. Through
uncertainty decomposition, we introduce a novel perspective on performance
enhancement, with a focus on epistemic uncertainty (EU). Our results reveal
that additional examples reduce total uncertainty in both simple and complex
tasks by injecting task-specific knowledge, thereby diminishing EU and
enhancing performance. For complex tasks, these advantages emerge only after
addressing the increased noise and uncertainty associated with longer inputs.
Finally, we explore the evolution of internal confidence across layers,
unveiling the mechanisms driving the reduction in uncertainty.

Conclusion: 频率偏差的学习解释了LLMs在推理任务中性能提升的原因。

Abstract: While fine-tuning LLMs on NLI corpora improves their inferential performance,
the underlying mechanisms driving this improvement remain largely opaque. In
this work, we conduct a series of experiments to investigate what LLMs actually
learn during fine-tuning. We begin by analyzing predicate frequencies in
premises and hypotheses across NLI datasets and identify a consistent frequency
bias, where predicates in hypotheses occur more frequently than those in
premises for positive instances. To assess the impact of this bias, we evaluate
both standard and NLI fine-tuned LLMs on bias-consistent and bias-adversarial
cases. We find that LLMs exploit frequency bias for inference and perform
poorly on adversarial instances. Furthermore, fine-tuned LLMs exhibit
significantly increased reliance on this bias, suggesting that they are
learning these frequency patterns from datasets. Finally, we compute the
frequencies of hyponyms and their corresponding hypernyms from WordNet,
revealing a correlation between frequency bias and textual entailment. These
findings help explain why learning frequency patterns can enhance model
performance on inference tasks.

Conclusion: FRANQ为RAG系统的幻觉检测提供了更精确的解决方案，区分事实性和忠实性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with external knowledge retrieval, an
approach known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), have shown strong
performance in open-domain question answering. However, RAG systems remain
susceptible to hallucinations: factually incorrect outputs that may arise
either from inconsistencies in the model's internal knowledge or incorrect use
of the retrieved context. Existing approaches often conflate factuality with
faithfulness to the retrieved context, misclassifying factually correct
statements as hallucinations if they are not directly supported by the
retrieval. In this paper, we introduce FRANQ (Faithfulness-based Retrieval
Augmented UNcertainty Quantification), a novel method for hallucination
detection in RAG outputs. FRANQ applies different Uncertainty Quantification
(UQ) techniques to estimate factuality based on whether a statement is faithful
to the retrieved context or not. To evaluate FRANQ and other UQ techniques for
RAG, we present a new long-form Question Answering (QA) dataset annotated for
both factuality and faithfulness, combining automated labeling with manual
validation of challenging examples. Extensive experiments on long- and
short-form QA across multiple datasets and LLMs show that FRANQ achieves more
accurate detection of factual errors in RAG-generated responses compared to
existing methods.

Conclusion: 推理级个性化是优化黑盒LLM输出的有效方法，RPM框架展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language tasks and are now widely used in
real-world applications. Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without
access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and
ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically
produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning
styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization,
which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying
model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on
response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without
modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM,
a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's
reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs
statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping
response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized
reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the
inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via
feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured
factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow
user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization
enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model
outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive
experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms
response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of
reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.

Conclusion: 直觉和深思熟虑的推理是互补系统，针对性训练可显著提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Recent studies show that the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) can be improved by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
question-answering (QA) tasks in areas such as math and coding. With a long
context length, LLMs may learn to perform search, as indicated by the
self-correction behavior observed in DeepSeek R1. However, this search behavior
is often imprecise and lacks confidence, resulting in long, redundant responses
and highlighting deficiencies in intuition and verification. Inspired by the
Dual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA
task that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within
a strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial
response; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more
deliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the
previous stage into precise steps. Our proposed task improves average accuracy
from 24.9% to 27.9% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 49.8% for
DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone
achieves 26.8% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial
inference efficiency gains. These findings suggest that intuition and
deliberative reasoning are distinct, complementary systems benefiting from
targeted training.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in domain adaptation techniques for large
language models, these methods remain computationally intensive, and the
resulting models can still exhibit hallucination issues. Most existing
adaptation methods do not prioritize reducing the computational resources
required for fine-tuning and inference of language models. Hallucination issues
have gradually decreased with each new model release. However, they remain
prevalent in engineering contexts, where generating well-structured text with
minimal errors and inconsistencies is critical. This work introduces a novel
approach called the Small Language Graph (SLG), which is a lightweight
adaptation solution designed to address the two key challenges outlined above.
The system is structured in the form of a graph, where each node represents a
lightweight expert - a small language model fine-tuned on specific and concise
texts. The results of this study have shown that SLG was able to surpass
conventional fine-tuning methods on the Exact Match metric by 3 times.
Additionally, the fine-tuning process was 1.7 times faster compared to that of
a larger stand-alone language model. These findings introduce a potential for
small to medium-sized engineering companies to confidently use generative AI
technologies, such as LLMs, without the necessity to invest in expensive
computational resources. Also, the graph architecture and the small size of
expert nodes offer a possible opportunity for distributed AI systems, thus
potentially diverting the global need for expensive centralized compute
clusters.

Abstract: Recently, deep reasoning large language models(LLMs) like DeepSeek-R1 have
made significant progress in tasks such as mathematics and coding. Inspired by
this, several studies have employed reinforcement learning(RL) to enhance
models' deep reasoning capabilities and improve machine translation(MT)
quality. However, the terminology translation, an essential task in MT, remains
unexplored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we propose \textbf{TAT-R1}, a
terminology-aware translation model trained with reinforcement learning and
word alignment. Specifically, we first extract the keyword translation pairs
using a word alignment model. Then we carefully design three types of
rule-based alignment rewards with the extracted alignment relationships. With
those alignment rewards, the RL-trained translation model can learn to focus on
the accurate translation of key information, including terminology in the
source text. Experimental results show the effectiveness of TAT-R1. Our model
significantly improves terminology translation accuracy compared to the
baseline models while maintaining comparable performance on general translation
tasks. In addition, we conduct detailed ablation studies of the
DeepSeek-R1-like training paradigm for machine translation and reveal several
key findings.

Abstract: As test-time scaling becomes a pivotal research frontier in Large Language
Models (LLMs) development, contemporary and advanced post-training
methodologies increasingly focus on extending the generation length of long
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses to enhance reasoning capabilities toward
DeepSeek R1-like performance. However, recent studies reveal a persistent
overthinking phenomenon in state-of-the-art reasoning models, manifesting as
excessive redundancy or repetitive thinking patterns in long CoT responses. To
address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage
reinforcement learning framework for achieving concise reasoning in LLMs, named
ConciseR. Specifically, the first stage, using more training steps, aims to
incentivize the model's reasoning capabilities via Group Relative Policy
Optimization with clip-higher and dynamic sampling components (GRPO++), and the
second stage, using fewer training steps, explicitly enforces conciseness and
improves efficiency via Length-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization
(L-GRPO). Significantly, ConciseR only optimizes response length once all
rollouts of a sample are correct, following the "walk before you run"
principle. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ConciseR model,
which generates more concise CoT reasoning responses, outperforms recent
state-of-the-art reasoning models with zero RL paradigm across AIME 2024,
MATH-500, AMC 2023, Minerva, and Olympiad benchmarks.

that frozen LLMs can generate hundreds of accurate tokens in just one forward

decoding. We investigate the behaviour of these embeddings and provide insight
into the type of information they encode. We also empirically show that
although these representations are not unique for a given text, they form
connected and local regions in embedding space - a property that suggests the
potential of learning a dedicated encoder into that space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在许多任务中表现出色，但它们仍容易产生幻觉（即事实错误的文本）。研究目标是探索LLMs是否能在未经明确训练的情况下捕捉不确定性。

Method: 通过将不确定性视为模型潜在空间中的线性概念，分析了LLMs在预训练后捕捉不确定性的能力，并研究了不同不确定性类型对任务正确性的预测作用。

Result: 研究发现LLMs能捕捉多种不确定性类型，这些类型对任务正确性预测有帮助。此外，模型规模对捕捉不确定性影响不大，而通过指令微调或[IDK]-token微调统一不确定性类型可提升正确性预测。

Conclusion: LLMs能隐式捕捉不确定性，且统一不确定性类型的方法有助于提升模型的正确性预测能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models are known to capture real-world knowledge, allowing
them to excel in many downstream tasks. Despite recent advances, these models
are still prone to what are commonly known as hallucinations, causing them to
emit unwanted and factually incorrect text. In this work, we study how well
LLMs capture uncertainty, without explicitly being trained for that. We show
that, if considering uncertainty as a linear concept in the model's latent
space, it might indeed be captured, even after only pretraining. We further
show that, though unintuitive, LLMs appear to capture several different types
of uncertainty, each of which can be useful to predict the correctness for a
specific task or benchmark. Furthermore, we provide in-depth results such as
demonstrating a correlation between our correction prediction and the model's
ability to abstain from misinformation using words, and the lack of impact of
model scaling for capturing uncertainty. Finally, we claim that unifying the
uncertainty types as a single one using instruction-tuning or [IDK]-token
tuning is helpful for the model in terms of correctness prediction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) recently achieved great success in medical text
summarization by simply using in-context learning. However, these recent
efforts do not perform fine-grained evaluations under difficult settings where
LLMs might fail. They typically report performance scores over the entire
dataset. Through our benchmarking study, we show that LLMs show a significant
performance drop for data points with high concentration of out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) words or with high novelty. Vocabulary adaptation is an intuitive
solution to this vocabulary mismatch issue where the LLM vocabulary gets
updated with certain expert domain (here, medical) words or subwords. An
interesting finding from our study is that Llama-3.1, even with a vocabulary
size of around 128K tokens, still faces over-fragmentation issue with medical
words. To that end, we show vocabulary adaptation helps improve the LLM
summarization performance even in difficult settings. Through extensive
experimentation of multiple vocabulary adaptation strategies, two continual
pretraining strategies, and three benchmark medical summarization datasets, we
gain valuable insights into the role of vocabulary adaptation strategies for
customizing LLMs to the medical domain. We also performed a human evaluation
study with medical experts where they found that vocabulary adaptation results
in more relevant and faithful summaries. Our codebase is made publicly

Abstract: Advancing code reasoning in large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally
limited by the scarcity of high-difficulty datasets, especially those with
verifiable input-output test cases necessary for rigorous solution validation
at scale. We introduce rStar-Coder, which significantly improves LLM code
reasoning capabilities by constructing a large-scale, verified dataset of 418K
competition-level code problems, 580K long-reasoning solutions along with rich
test cases of varying difficulty. This is achieved through three core
contributions: (1) we curate competitive programming code problems and oracle
solutions to synthesize new, solvable problems; (2) we introduce a reliable
input-output test case synthesis pipeline that decouples the generation into a
three-step input generation method and a mutual verification mechanism for
effective output labeling; (3) we augment problems with high-quality,
test-case-verified long-reasoning solutions. Extensive experiments on Qwen
models (1.5B-14B) across various code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of rStar-Coder dataset, achieving leading performance comparable to
frontier reasoning LLMs with much smaller model sizes. On LiveCodeBench,
rStar-Coder improves Qwen2.5-7B from 17.4% to an impressive 57.3%, and
Qwen2.5-14B from 23.3% to 62.5%, surpassing o3-mini (low) by3.1%. On the more

Result: 大多数模型会根据人口特征调整表达，尤其是年龄和教育水平，但一致性不同。推理能力强的模型表现更好。

Conclusion: 推理能力对LLM的社会人口适应性至关重要。

Abstract: Effective engagement by large language models (LLMs) requires adapting
responses to users' sociodemographic characteristics, such as age, occupation,
and education level. While many real-world applications leverage dialogue
history for contextualization, existing evaluations of LLMs' behavioral
adaptation often focus on single-turn prompts. In this paper, we propose a
framework to evaluate LLM adaptation when attributes are introduced either (1)
explicitly via user profiles in the prompt or (2) implicitly through multi-turn
dialogue history. We assess the consistency of model behavior across these
modalities. Using a multi-agent pipeline, we construct a synthetic dataset
pairing dialogue histories with distinct user profiles and employ questions
from the Value Survey Module (VSM 2013) (Hofstede and Hofstede, 2016) to probe
value expression. Our findings indicate that most models adjust their expressed
values in response to demographic changes, particularly in age and education
level, but consistency varies. Models with stronger reasoning capabilities
demonstrate greater alignment, indicating the importance of reasoning in robust
sociodemographic adaptation.

Conclusion: AutoJudger为MLLM的高效评估提供了一种可行的解决方案，显著降低了成本。

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is increasingly
expensive, as the growing size and cross-modality complexity of benchmarks
demand significant scoring efforts. To tackle with this difficulty, we
introduce AutoJudger, an agent-driven framework for efficient and adaptive
benchmarking of MLLMs that tackles this escalating cost. AutoJudger employs the
Item Response Theory (IRT) to estimate the question difficulty and an
autonomous evaluation agent to dynamically select the most informative test
questions based on the model's real-time performance. Specifically, AutoJudger
incorporates two pivotal components: a semantic-aware retrieval mechanism to
ensure that selected questions cover diverse and challenging scenarios across
both vision and language modalities, and a dynamic memory that maintains
contextual statistics of previously evaluated questions to guide coherent and
globally informed question selection throughout the evaluation process.
Extensive experiments on four representative multimodal benchmarks demonstrate
that our adaptive framework dramatically reduces evaluation expenses, i.e.
AutoJudger uses only 4% of the data to achieve over 90% ranking accuracy with
the full benchmark evaluation on MMT-Bench.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
generating novel research ideas. However, these ideas often face challenges
related to feasibility and expected effectiveness. This paper explores how
augmenting LLMs with relevant data during the idea generation process can
enhance the quality of generated ideas. We introduce two ways of incorporating
data: (1) providing metadata during the idea generation stage to guide LLMs
toward feasible directions, and (2) adding automatic validation during the idea
selection stage to assess the empirical plausibility of hypotheses within
ideas. We conduct experiments in the social science domain, specifically with
climate negotiation topics, and find that metadata improves the feasibility of
generated ideas by 20%, while automatic validation improves the overall quality
of selected ideas by 7%. A human study shows that LLM-generated ideas, along
with their related data and validation processes, inspire researchers to
propose research ideas with higher quality. Our work highlights the potential
of data-driven research idea generation, and underscores the practical utility
of LLM-assisted ideation in real-world academic settings.

Abstract: In high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance, effective
decision-making demands not just accurate outcomes but transparent and
explainable reasoning. However, current language models often lack the
structured deliberation needed for such tasks, instead generating decisions and
justifications in a disconnected, post-hoc manner. To address this, we propose
DecisionFlow, a novel decision modeling framework that guides models to reason
over structured representations of actions, attributes, and constraints. Rather
than predicting answers directly from prompts, DecisionFlow builds a
semantically grounded decision space and infers a latent utility function to
evaluate trade-offs in a transparent, utility-driven manner. This process
produces decisions tightly coupled with interpretable rationales reflecting the
model's reasoning. Empirical results on two high-stakes benchmarks show that
DecisionFlow not only achieves up to 30% accuracy gains over strong prompting
baselines but also enhances alignment in outcomes. Our work is a critical step
toward integrating symbolic reasoning with LLMs, enabling more accountable,
explainable, and reliable LLM decision support systems. We release the data and

Result: 实验显示，即使先进LLMs在此任务上的事实准确性不超过25%，且性能随输出维度增加而下降。

Conclusion: RelationalFactQA为未来LLM事实性研究提供了重要工具，揭示了当前模型在结构化知识合成上的局限性。

Abstract: Factuality in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a persistent challenge. Current
benchmarks often assess short factual answers, overlooking the critical ability
to generate structured, multi-record tabular outputs from parametric knowledge.
We demonstrate that this relational fact retrieval is substantially more
difficult than isolated point-wise queries, even when individual facts are
known to the model, exposing distinct failure modes sensitive to output
dimensionality (e.g., number of attributes or records). To systematically
evaluate this under-explored capability, we introduce RelationalFactQA, a new
benchmark featuring diverse natural language questions (paired with SQL) and
gold-standard tabular answers, specifically designed to assess knowledge
retrieval in a structured format. RelationalFactQA enables analysis across
varying query complexities, output sizes, and data characteristics. Our
experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle significantly, not
exceeding 25% factual accuracy in generating relational outputs, with
performance notably degrading as output dimensionality increases. These
findings underscore critical limitations in current LLMs' ability to synthesize
structured factual knowledge and establish RelationalFactQA as a crucial
resource for measuring future progress in LLM factuality.

Abstract: Tools enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex problem-solving tasks, but not all tasks have available tools. In the
absence of predefined tools, prior works have explored instructing LLMs to
generate tools on their own. However, such approaches rely heavily on the
models' internal knowledge and would fail in domains beyond the LLMs' knowledge
scope. To address this limitation, we propose RefTool, a reference-guided
framework for automatic tool creation that leverages structured external
materials such as textbooks. RefTool consists of two modules: (1) tool
creation, where LLMs generate executable tools from reference content, validate
them using illustrative examples, and organize them hierarchically into a
toolbox; and (2) tool utilization, where LLMs navigate the toolbox structure to
select and apply the appropriate tools to solve problems. Experiments on
causality, physics, and chemistry benchmarks demonstrate that RefTool
outperforms existing tool-creation and domain-specific reasoning methods by
11.3% on average accuracy, while being cost-efficient and broadly
generalizable. Analyses reveal that grounding tool creation in references
produces accurate and faithful tools, and that the hierarchical structure
facilitates effective tool selection. RefTool enables LLMs to overcome
knowledge limitations, demonstrating the value of grounding tool creation in
external references for enhanced and generalizable reasoning.

Abstract: Diffusion language models offer parallel token generation and inherent
bidirectionality, promising more efficient and powerful sequence modeling
compared to autoregressive approaches. However, state-of-the-art diffusion
models (e.g., Dream 7B, LLaDA 8B) suffer from slow inference. While they match
the quality of similarly sized Autoregressive (AR) Models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B,
Llama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward
passes, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for
long input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token
generation introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling
heuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising
steps. We address these limitations with two training-free techniques. First,
we propose FreeCache, a Key-Value (KV) approximation caching technique that
reuses stable KV projections across denoising steps, effectively reducing the
computational cost of DLM inference. Second, we introduce Guided Diffusion, a
training-free method that uses a lightweight pretrained autoregressive model to
supervise token unmasking, dramatically reducing the total number of denoising
iterations without sacrificing quality. We conduct extensive evaluations on
open-source reasoning benchmarks, and our combined methods deliver up to a 34x
end-to-end speedup without compromising accuracy. For the first time, diffusion
language models achieve a comparable and even faster latency as the widely
adopted autoregressive models. Our work successfully paved the way for scaling
up the diffusion language model to a broader scope of applications across
different domains.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of post-training techniques for reasoning and
information seeking, large language models (LLMs) can incorporate a large
quantity of retrieved knowledge to solve complex tasks. However, the limited
context window of LLMs obstructs scaling the amount of external knowledge
input, prohibiting further improvement, especially for tasks requiring
significant amount of external knowledge. Existing context window extension
methods inevitably cause information loss. LLM-based multi-agent methods emerge
as a new paradigm to handle massive input in a distributional manner, where we
identify two core bottlenecks in existing knowledge synchronization and
reasoning processes. In this work, we develop a multi-agent framework,
$\textbf{ExtAgents}$, to overcome the bottlenecks and enable better scalability
in inference-time knowledge integration without longer-context training.
Benchmarked with our enhanced multi-hop question answering test,
$\textbf{$\boldsymbol{\infty}$Bench+}$, and other public test sets including
long survey generation, ExtAgents significantly enhances the performance over
existing non-training methods with the same amount of external knowledge input,
regardless of whether it falls $\textit{within or exceeds the context window}$.
Moreover, the method maintains high efficiency due to high parallelism. Further
study in the coordination of LLM agents on increasing external knowledge input
could benefit real-world applications.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly navigate applications in healthcare, law, and
governance, understanding how they handle ethically complex scenarios becomes
critical. Previous work has mainly examined the moral judgments in large
language models (LLMs), rather than their underlying moral reasoning process.
In contrast, we focus on a large-scale analysis of the moral reasoning traces
provided by LLMs. Furthermore, unlike prior work that attempted to draw
inferences from only a handful of moral dilemmas, our study leverages over 600
distinct trolley problems as probes for revealing the reasoning patterns that
emerge within different LLMs. We introduce and test a taxonomy of moral
rationales to systematically classify reasoning traces according to two main
normative ethical theories: consequentialism and deontology. Our analysis
reveals that LLM chains-of-thought tend to favor deontological principles based
on moral obligations, while post-hoc explanations shift notably toward
consequentialist rationales that emphasize utility. Our framework provides a
foundation for understanding how LLMs process and articulate ethical
considerations, an important step toward safe and interpretable deployment of
LLMs in high-stakes decision-making environments. Our code is available at

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in clinical
question answering, with recent multi-agent frameworks further improving
diagnostic accuracy via collaborative reasoning. However, we identify a
recurring issue of Silent Agreement, where agents prematurely converge on
diagnoses without sufficient critical analysis, particularly in complex or
ambiguous cases. We present a new concept called Catfish Agent, a
role-specialized LLM designed to inject structured dissent and counter silent
agreement. Inspired by the ``catfish effect'' in organizational psychology, the
Catfish Agent is designed to challenge emerging consensus to stimulate deeper
reasoning. We formulate two mechanisms to encourage effective and context-aware
interventions: (i) a complexity-aware intervention that modulates agent
engagement based on case difficulty, and (ii) a tone-calibrated intervention
articulated to balance critique and collaboration. Evaluations on nine medical
Q&A and three medical VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms both single- and multi-agent LLMs frameworks, including leading
commercial models such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1.

Abstract: Multilingual Alignment is an effective and representative paradigm to enhance
LLMs' multilingual capabilities, which transfers the capabilities from the
high-resource languages to the low-resource languages. Meanwhile, some
researches on language-specific neurons reveal that there are language-specific
neurons that are selectively activated in LLMs when processing different
languages. This provides a new perspective to analyze and understand LLMs'
mechanisms more specifically in multilingual scenarios. In this work, we
propose a new finer-grained neuron identification algorithm, which detects
language neurons~(including language-specific neurons and language-related
neurons) and language-agnostic neurons. Furthermore, based on the
distributional characteristics of different types of neurons, we divide the
LLMs' internal process for multilingual inference into four parts: (1)
multilingual understanding, (2) shared semantic space reasoning, (3)
multilingual output space transformation, and (4) vocabulary space outputting.
Additionally, we systematically analyze the models before and after alignment
with a focus on different types of neurons. We also analyze the phenomenon of
''Spontaneous Multilingual Alignment''. Overall, our work conducts a
comprehensive investigation based on different types of neurons, providing
empirical results and valuable insights for better understanding multilingual

Motivation: 随着LLMs在代码理解和生成方面的进步，评估其在源代码漏洞分析中的可靠性变得至关重要。现有研究常忽视结构和语义推理的重要性。

Method: 引入SV-TrustEval-C基准，通过结构推理（代码元素关系）和语义推理（逻辑一致性）两个维度评估LLMs。

Result: 当前LLMs在复杂代码关系理解上表现不佳，漏洞分析更多依赖模式匹配而非逻辑推理。

Conclusion: SV-TrustEval-C基准有效揭示了LLMs在漏洞分析中的不足，为提升其推理能力和可信度提供了方向。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve in understanding and generating code,
accurately evaluating their reliability in analyzing source code
vulnerabilities becomes increasingly vital. While studies have examined LLM
capabilities in tasks like vulnerability detection and repair, they often
overlook the importance of both structure and semantic reasoning crucial for
trustworthy vulnerability analysis. To address this gap, we introduce
SV-TrustEval-C, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' abilities for
vulnerability analysis of code written in the C programming language through
two key dimensions: structure reasoning - assessing how models identify
relationships between code elements under varying data and control flow
complexities; and semantic reasoning - examining their logical consistency in
scenarios where code is structurally and semantically perturbed. Our results
show that current LLMs are far from satisfactory in understanding complex code
relationships and that their vulnerability analyses rely more on pattern
matching than on robust logical reasoning. These findings underscore the
effectiveness of the SV-TrustEval-C benchmark and highlight critical areas for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world
vulnerability analysis tasks. Our initial benchmark dataset is publicly
available.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to process information using a
proficient internal language consistently, referred to as latent language,
which may differ from the input or output languages. However, how the
discrepancy between the latent language and the input and output language
affects downstream task performance remains largely unexplored. While many
studies research the latent language of LLMs, few address its importance in
influencing task performance. In our study, we hypothesize that thinking in
latent language consistently enhances downstream task performance. To validate
this, our work varies the input prompt languages across multiple downstream
tasks and analyzes the correlation between consistency in latent language and
task performance. We create datasets consisting of questions from diverse
domains such as translation and geo-culture, which are influenced by the choice
of latent language. Experimental results across multiple LLMs on translation
and geo-culture tasks, which are sensitive to the choice of language, indicate
that maintaining consistency in latent language is not always necessary for
optimal downstream task performance. This is because these models adapt their
internal representations near the final layers to match the target language,
reducing the impact of consistency on overall performance.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) have shown promise in enabling
zero-shot reasoning over unseen graphs by learning transferable patterns.
However, most existing KGFMs rely solely on graph structure, overlooking the
rich semantic signals encoded in textual attributes. We introduce SEMMA, a
dual-module KGFM that systematically integrates transferable textual semantics
alongside structure. SEMMA leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich
relation identifiers, generating semantic embeddings that subsequently form a
textual relation graph, which is fused with the structural component. Across 54
diverse KGs, SEMMA outperforms purely structural baselines like ULTRA in fully
inductive link prediction. Crucially, we show that in more challenging
generalization settings, where the test-time relation vocabulary is entirely
unseen, structural methods collapse while SEMMA is 2x more effective. Our
findings demonstrate that textual semantics are critical for generalization in
settings where structure alone fails, highlighting the need for foundation
models that unify structural and linguistic signals in knowledge reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making tasks
like r\'esum\'e screening and content moderation, giving them the power to
amplify or suppress certain perspectives. While previous research has
identified disability-related biases in LLMs, little is known about how they
conceptualize ableism or detect it in text. We evaluate the ability of four
LLMs to identify nuanced ableism directed at autistic individuals. We examine
the gap between their understanding of relevant terminology and their
effectiveness in recognizing ableist content in context. Our results reveal
that LLMs can identify autism-related language but often miss harmful or
offensive connotations. Further, we conduct a qualitative comparison of human
and LLM explanations. We find that LLMs tend to rely on surface-level keyword
matching, leading to context misinterpretations, in contrast to human
annotators who consider context, speaker identity, and potential impact. On the
other hand, both LLMs and humans agree on the annotation scheme, suggesting
that a binary classification is adequate for evaluating LLM performance, which
is consistent with findings from prior studies involving human annotators.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal question answering have primarily focused on
combining heterogeneous modalities or fine-tuning multimodal large language
models. While these approaches have shown strong performance, they often rely
on a single, generalized reasoning strategy, overlooking the unique
characteristics of each modality ultimately limiting both accuracy and
interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose MAMMQA, a
multi-agent QA framework for multimodal inputs spanning text, tables, and
images. Our system includes two Visual Language Model (VLM) agents and one
text-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The first VLM decomposes the user
query into sub-questions and sequentially retrieves partial answers from each
modality. The second VLM synthesizes and refines these results through
cross-modal reasoning. Finally, the LLM integrates the insights into a cohesive
answer. This modular design enhances interpretability by making the reasoning
process transparent and allows each agent to operate within its domain of
expertise. Experiments on diverse multimodal QA benchmarks demonstrate that our
cooperative, multi-agent framework consistently outperforms existing baselines
in both accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in tasks such as code and mathematics. However, their potential to
internalize structured spatial knowledge remains underexplored. This study
investigates whether LLMs, grounded in locally relative human observations, can
construct coherent global spatial cognition by integrating fragmented
relational descriptions. We focus on two core aspects of spatial cognition:
spatial perception, where models infer consistent global layouts from local
positional relationships, and spatial navigation, where models learn road
connectivity from trajectory data and plan optimal paths between unconnected
locations. Experiments conducted in a simulated urban environment demonstrate
that LLMs not only generalize to unseen spatial relationships between points of
interest (POIs) but also exhibit latent representations aligned with real-world
spatial distributions. Furthermore, LLMs can learn road connectivity from
trajectory descriptions, enabling accurate path planning and dynamic spatial
awareness during navigation.

Abstract: Multilingual LLM performance is often critically dependent on model size.
With an eye on efficiency, this has led to a surge in interest in one-shot
pruning methods that retain the benefits of large-scale pretraining while
shrinking the model size. However, as pruning tends to come with performance
loss, it is important to understand the trade-offs between multilinguality and
sparsification. In this work, we study multilingual performance under different
sparsity constraints and show that moderate ratios already substantially harm
performance. To help bridge this gap, we propose M-Wanda, a pruning method that
models cross-lingual variation by incorporating language-aware activation
statistics into its pruning criterion and dynamically adjusts layerwise
sparsity based on cross-lingual importance. We show that M-Wanda consistently
improves performance at minimal additional costs. We are the first to
explicitly optimize pruning to retain multilingual performance, and hope to
inspire future advances in multilingual pruning.

Abstract: Understanding robustness is essential for building reliable NLP systems.
Unfortunately, in the context of machine translation, previous work mainly
focused on documenting robustness failures or improving robustness. In
contrast, we study robustness from a model representation perspective by
looking at internal model representations of ungrammatical inputs and how they
evolve through model layers. For this purpose, we perform Grammatical Error
Detection (GED) probing and representational similarity analysis. Our findings
indicate that the encoder first detects the grammatical error, then corrects it
by moving its representation toward the correct form. To understand what
contributes to this process, we turn to the attention mechanism where we
identify what we term Robustness Heads. We find that Robustness Heads attend to
interpretable linguistic units when responding to grammatical errors, and that
when we fine-tune models for robustness, they tend to rely more on Robustness
Heads for updating the ungrammatical word representation.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have shown promising capabilities in a growing range of
software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, advancing this field faces two
critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially
data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with
development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes
of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code
generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive
tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive
SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks
quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these
limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to
continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub
repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset
comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for
reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous
supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a
contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare
results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and
show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to
contamination issues.

Conclusion: 静态示例选择和提示优化框架能显著提升生产场景中NL2SQL系统的性能。

Abstract: NL2SQL approaches have greatly benefited from the impressive capabilities of
large language models (LLMs). In particular, bootstrapping an NL2SQL system for
a specific domain can be as simple as instructing an LLM with sufficient
contextual information, such as schema details and translation demonstrations.
However, building an accurate system still requires the rigorous task of
selecting the right context for each query-including identifying relevant
schema elements, cell values, and suitable exemplars that help the LLM
understand domain-specific nuances. Retrieval-based methods have become the
go-to approach for identifying such context. While effective, these methods
introduce additional inference-time costs due to the retrieval process.
  In this paper, we argue that production scenarios demand high-precision,
high-performance NL2SQL systems, rather than simply high-quality SQL
generation, which is the focus of most current NL2SQL approaches. In such
scenarios, the careful selection of a static set of exemplars-capturing the
intricacies of the query log, target database, SQL constructs, and execution
latencies-plays a more crucial role than exemplar selection based solely on
similarity. The key challenge, however, lies in identifying a representative
set of exemplars for a given production setting. To this end, we propose a
prompt optimization framework that not only addresses the high-precision
requirement but also optimizes the performance of the generated SQL through
multi-objective optimization. Preliminary empirical analysis demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: SeqPO-SiMT在7B LLM上的表现甚至媲美高性能离线翻译模型。

Abstract: We present Sequential Policy Optimization for Simultaneous Machine
Translation (SeqPO-SiMT), a new policy optimization framework that defines the
simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) task as a sequential decision making
problem, incorporating a tailored reward to enhance translation quality while
reducing latency. In contrast to popular Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) methods, such as PPO and DPO, which are typically applied in
single-step tasks, SeqPO-SiMT effectively tackles the multi-step SiMT task.
This intuitive framework allows the SiMT LLMs to simulate and refine the SiMT
process using a tailored reward. We conduct experiments on six datasets from
diverse domains for En to Zh and Zh to En SiMT tasks, demonstrating that
SeqPO-SiMT consistently achieves significantly higher translation quality with
lower latency. In particular, SeqPO-SiMT outperforms the supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) model by 1.13 points in COMET, while reducing the Average Lagging by 6.17
in the NEWSTEST2021 En to Zh dataset. While SiMT operates with far less context
than offline translation, the SiMT results of SeqPO-SiMT on 7B LLM surprisingly
rival the offline translation of high-performing LLMs, including
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct.

Abstract: We introduce FinTagging, the first full-scope, table-aware XBRL benchmark
designed to evaluate the structured information extraction and semantic
alignment capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the context of
XBRL-based financial reporting. Unlike prior benchmarks that oversimplify XBRL
tagging as flat multi-class classification and focus solely on narrative text,
FinTagging decomposes the XBRL tagging problem into two subtasks: FinNI for
financial entity extraction and FinCL for taxonomy-driven concept alignment. It
requires models to jointly extract facts and align them with the full 10k+
US-GAAP taxonomy across both unstructured text and structured tables, enabling
realistic, fine-grained evaluation. We assess a diverse set of LLMs under
zero-shot settings, systematically analyzing their performance on both subtasks
and overall tagging accuracy. Our results reveal that, while LLMs demonstrate
strong generalization in information extraction, they struggle with
fine-grained concept alignment, particularly in disambiguating closely related
taxonomy entries. These findings highlight the limitations of existing LLMs in
fully automating XBRL tagging and underscore the need for improved semantic
reasoning and schema-aware modeling to meet the demands of accurate financial
disclosure. Code is available at our GitHub repository and data is at our

victims. However, due to manipulation's nuanced and context-specific nature,
identifying manipulative language in complex, multi-turn, and multi-person
conversations remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs).
To address this gap, we introduce the MultiManip dataset, comprising 220
multi-turn, multi-person dialogues balanced between manipulative and
non-manipulative interactions, all drawn from reality shows that mimic
real-world scenarios. For manipulative interactions, it includes 11 distinct
manipulations depicting real-life scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B, employing various
prompting strategies. Despite their capabilities, these models often struggle
to detect manipulation effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose

Abstract: A hallmark of human innovation is the process of recombination -- creating
original ideas by integrating elements of existing mechanisms and concepts. In
this work, we automatically mine the scientific literature and build CHIMERA: a
large-scale knowledge base (KB) of recombination examples. CHIMERA can be used
to empirically explore at scale how scientists recombine concepts and take
inspiration from different areas, or to train supervised machine learning
models that learn to predict new creative cross-domain directions. To build
this KB, we present a novel information extraction task of extracting
recombination from scientific paper abstracts, collect a high-quality corpus of
hundreds of manually annotated abstracts, and use it to train an LLM-based
extraction model. The model is applied to a large corpus of papers in the AI
domain, yielding a KB of over 28K recombination examples. We analyze CHIMERA to
explore the properties of recombination in different subareas of AI. Finally,
we train a scientific hypothesis generation model using the KB, which predicts
new recombination directions that real-world researchers find inspiring. Our

Conclusion: 论文提出的SCM指标和BASIC基准为检测和减少LVLMs中的刻板印象提供了有效工具。

Abstract: As large vision language models(LVLMs) rapidly advance, concerns about their
potential to learn and generate social biases and stereotypes are increasing.
Previous studies on LVLM's stereotypes face two primary limitations: metrics
that overlooked the importance of content words, and datasets that overlooked
the effect of color. To address these limitations, this study introduces new
evaluation metrics based on the Stereotype Content Model (SCM). We also propose
BASIC, a benchmark for assessing gender, race, and color stereotypes. Using SCM
metrics and BASIC, we conduct a study with eight LVLMs to discover stereotypes.
As a result, we found three findings. (1) The SCM-based evaluation is effective
in capturing stereotypes. (2) LVLMs exhibit color stereotypes in the output
along with gender and race ones. (3) Interaction between model architecture and
parameter sizes seems to affect stereotypes. We release BASIC publicly on
[anonymized for review].

Motivation: 现有方法通常关注任务特定知识，而忽视了共享的任务无关知识。受人类互补学习系统理论启发，论文旨在通过区分任务特定和任务无关知识来改进持续学习。

Method: InfoComp方法通过信息理论框架设计两个损失函数，分别优化P-Prompt和S-Prompt的学习，以增强任务特定知识的积累和任务无关知识的保留。

Result: 在多个持续文本分类基准测试中，InfoComp优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InfoComp通过区分任务特定和任务无关知识，有效缓解了灾难性遗忘并提升了知识迁移能力。

Abstract: Continual Text Classification (CTC) aims to continuously classify new text
data over time while minimizing catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired
knowledge. However, existing methods often focus on task-specific knowledge,
overlooking the importance of shared, task-agnostic knowledge. Inspired by the
complementary learning systems theory, which posits that humans learn
continually through the interaction of two systems -- the hippocampus,
responsible for forming distinct representations of specific experiences, and
the neocortex, which extracts more general and transferable representations
from past experiences -- we introduce Information-Theoretic Complementary
Prompts (InfoComp), a novel approach for CTC. InfoComp explicitly learns two
distinct prompt spaces: P(rivate)-Prompt and S(hared)-Prompt. These
respectively encode task-specific and task-invariant knowledge, enabling models
to sequentially learn classification tasks without relying on data replay. To
promote more informative prompt learning, InfoComp uses an
information-theoretic framework that maximizes mutual information between
different parameters (or encoded representations). Within this framework, we
design two novel loss functions: (1) to strengthen the accumulation of
task-specific knowledge in P-Prompt, effectively mitigating catastrophic
forgetting, and (2) to enhance the retention of task-invariant knowledge in
S-Prompt, improving forward knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on
diverse CTC benchmarks show that our approach outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在两个真实数据集上，LMCD在冷启动场景中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LMCD展示了LLMs在认知诊断中的潜力，尤其是在冷启动场景下。

Abstract: Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) has become a critical task in AI-empowered
education, supporting personalized learning by accurately assessing students'
cognitive states. However, traditional CD models often struggle in cold-start
scenarios due to the lack of student-exercise interaction data. Recent
NLP-based approaches leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown
promise by utilizing textual features but fail to fully bridge the gap between
semantic understanding and cognitive profiling. In this work, we propose
Language Models as Zeroshot Cognitive Diagnosis Learners (LMCD), a novel
framework designed to handle cold-start challenges by harnessing large language
models (LLMs). LMCD operates via two primary phases: (1) Knowledge Diffusion,
where LLMs generate enriched contents of exercises and knowledge concepts
(KCs), establishing stronger semantic links; and (2) Semantic-Cognitive Fusion,
where LLMs employ causal attention mechanisms to integrate textual information
and student cognitive states, creating comprehensive profiles for both students
and exercises. These representations are efficiently trained with off-the-shelf
CD models. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that LMCD
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both exercise-cold and
domain-cold settings. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, making them promising for educational applications. However,
their capacity for complex reasoning, particularly in domains such as physics,
remains underexplored. This study investigates the high school physics
reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art SLMs (under 4 billion parameters),
including instruct versions of Llama 3.2, Phi 4 Mini, Gemma 3, and Qwen series.
We developed a comprehensive physics dataset from the OpenStax High School
Physics textbook, annotated according to Bloom's Taxonomy, with LaTeX and
plaintext mathematical notations. A novel cultural contextualization approach
was applied to a subset, creating culturally adapted problems for Asian,
African, and South American/Australian contexts while preserving core physics
principles. Using an LLM-as-a-judge framework with Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash,
we evaluated answer and reasoning chain correctness, along with calculation
accuracy. The results reveal significant differences between the SLMs. Qwen 3
1.7B achieved high `answer accuracy' (85%), but `fully correct reasoning' was
substantially low (38%). The format of the mathematical notation had a
negligible impact on performance. SLMs exhibited varied performance across the
physics topics and showed a decline in reasoning quality with increasing
cognitive and knowledge complexity. In particular, the consistency of reasoning
was largely maintained in diverse cultural contexts, especially by better
performing models. These findings indicate that, while SLMs can often find
correct answers, their underlying reasoning is frequently flawed, suggesting an
overreliance on pattern recognition. For SLMs to become reliable educational
tools in physics, future development must prioritize enhancing genuine
understanding and the generation of sound, verifiable reasoning chains over
mere answer accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive and systematic analysis of

text for improving the performance. Our contributions are threefold: (1)
Benchmarking VLMs with diverse prompting strategies purposely to each sub-task;
(2) Evaluating LoRA fine-tuning across all VLM components to assess performance
gains; and (3) Proposing a novel approach where detailed meme interpretations
generated by VLMs are used to train smaller language models (LLMs),
significantly improving classification. The strategy of combining VLMs with
LLMs improved the baseline performance by 8.34%, 3.52% and 26.24% for sarcasm,
offensive and sentiment classification, respectively. Our results reveal the
strengths and limitations of VLMs and present a novel strategy for meme

Abstract: Cross-domain constituency parsing is still an unsolved challenge in
computational linguistics since the available multi-domain constituency
treebank is limited. We investigate automatic treebank generation by large
language models (LLMs) in this paper. The performance of LLMs on constituency
parsing is poor, therefore we propose a novel treebank generation method, LLM
back generation, which is similar to the reverse process of constituency
parsing. LLM back generation takes the incomplete cross-domain constituency
tree with only domain keyword leaf nodes as input and fills the missing words
to generate the cross-domain constituency treebank. Besides, we also introduce
a span-level contrastive learning pre-training strategy to make full use of the
LLM back generation treebank for cross-domain constituency parsing. We verify
the effectiveness of our LLM back generation treebank coupled with contrastive
learning pre-training on five target domains of MCTB. Experimental results show
that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average results

Abstract: Dialogue Topic Segmentation (DTS) aims to divide dialogues into coherent

complexity of recently proposed solutions. On the other hand, Despite advances
in Large Language Models (LLMs) and reasoning strategies, these have rarely

Open-domain Dialogue Topic Segmentation, which utilizes LLM-based multi-step
deductive reasoning to enhance DTS performance and enable case study using
intermediate result. Our method employs a structured prompting approach for
bidirectional context summarization, utterance intent classification, and
deductive topic shift detection. In the intent classification process, we
propose the generalizable intent list for domain-agnostic dialogue intent
classification. Experiments in various dialogue settings demonstrate that
Def-DTS consistently outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art approaches,
with each subtask contributing to improved performance, particularly in
reducing type 2 error. We also explore the potential for autolabeling,

Abstract: Large-scale training corpora have significantly improved the performance of
ASR models. Unfortunately, due to the relative scarcity of data, Chinese
accents and dialects remain a challenge for most ASR models. Recent
advancements in self-supervised learning have shown that self-supervised pre-

ASR performance in low-resource scenarios. We aim to investigate the
effectiveness of this paradigm for Chinese dialects. Specifically, we pre-train
a Data2vec2 model on 300,000 hours of unlabeled dialect and accented speech
data and do alignment training on a supervised dataset of 40,000 hours. Then,
we systematically examine the impact of various projectors and LLMs on
Mandarin, dialect, and accented speech recognition performance under this
paradigm. Our method achieved SOTA results on multiple dialect datasets,
including Kespeech. We will open-source our work to promote reproducible

Conclusion: ReSCORE为无需标注文档的密集检索器训练提供了有效解决方案，提升了MHQA性能。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) involves reasoning across multiple
documents to answer complex questions. Dense retrievers typically outperform
sparse methods like BM25 by leveraging semantic embeddings; however, they
require labeled query-document pairs for fine-tuning. This poses a significant
challenge in MHQA due to the high variability of queries (reformulated)
questions throughout the reasoning steps. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce Retriever Supervision with Consistency and Relevance (ReSCORE), a
novel method for training dense retrievers for MHQA without labeled documents.
ReSCORE leverages large language models to capture each documents relevance to
the question and consistency with the correct answer and use them to train a
retriever within an iterative question-answering framework. Experiments on
three MHQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ReSCORE, with
significant improvements in retrieval, and in turn, the state-of-the-art MHQA
performance. Our implementation is available at:

Abstract: Pixel language models operate directly on images of rendered text,

multilingual pretraining remains underexplored. We introduce PIXEL-M4, a model
pretrained on four visually and linguistically diverse languages: English,
Hindi, Ukrainian, and Simplified Chinese. Multilingual evaluations on semantic
and syntactic tasks show that PIXEL-M4 outperforms an English-only counterpart
on non-Latin scripts. Word-level probing analyses confirm that PIXEL-M4
captures rich linguistic features, even in languages not seen during
pretraining. Furthermore, an analysis of its hidden representations shows that
multilingual pretraining yields a semantic embedding space closely aligned
across the languages used for pretraining. This work demonstrates that
multilingual pretraining substantially enhances the capability of pixel

Abstract: With over 2,000 languages and potentially millions of speakers, Africa
represents one of the richest linguistic regions in the world. Yet, this
diversity is scarcely reflected in state-of-the-art natural language processing
(NLP) systems and large language models (LLMs), which predominantly support a
narrow set of high-resource languages. This exclusion not only limits the reach
and utility of modern NLP technologies but also risks widening the digital
divide across linguistic communities. Nevertheless, NLP research on African
languages is active and growing. In recent years, there has been a surge of
interest in this area, driven by several factors-including the creation of
multilingual language resources, the rise of community-led initiatives, and
increased support through funding programs. In this survey, we analyze 734
research papers on NLP for African languages published over the past five
years, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress across core tasks.
We identify key trends shaping the field and conclude by outlining promising
directions to foster more inclusive and sustainable NLP research for African
languages.

Motivation: 探索LLMs与传统监督ML技术在医学数据（尤其是精神病学领域）中的结合，以应对复杂语言和上下文特征。

Method: 集成LLaMA3（捕捉长程语义）、RoBERTa（临床叙述微调）和SVM（TF-IDF特征），通过多数投票聚合。

Result: 集成模型优于单一模型，F1分数0.71，召回率提升且保持高精度。

Conclusion: 混合架构结合LLMs的语义丰富性和传统ML的解析能力，为精神病学文本分类提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), their integration
with traditional supervised machine learning (ML) techniques that have proven
applicability to medical data remains underexplored. This is particularly true
for psychiatric applications, where narrative data often exhibit nuanced
linguistic and contextual complexity, and can benefit from the combination of
multiple models with differing characteristics. In this study, we introduce an
ensemble framework for automatically classifying
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis (binary) using
narrative transcripts. Our approach integrates three complementary models:
LLaMA3, an open-source LLM that captures long-range semantic structure;
RoBERTa, a pre-trained transformer model fine-tuned on labeled clinical
narratives; and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained using
TF-IDF-based lexical features. These models are aggregated through a majority
voting mechanism to enhance predictive robustness. The dataset includes 441
instances, including 352 for training and 89 for validation. Empirical results
show that the ensemble outperforms individual models, achieving an F$_1$ score
of 0.71 (95\% CI: [0.60-0.80]). Compared to the best-performing individual
model (SVM), the ensemble improved recall while maintaining competitive
precision. This indicates the strong sensitivity of the ensemble in identifying
ADHD-related linguistic cues. These findings demonstrate the promise of hybrid
architectures that leverage the semantic richness of LLMs alongside the
interpretability and pattern recognition capabilities of traditional supervised
ML, offering a new direction for robust and generalizable psychiatric text
classification.

Method: 创建SOMADHAN数据集，评估多种LLM（如GPT-4o、LLaMA等）在零样本和少样本下的表现，结合CoT提示和LoRA微调。

Conclusion: 工作填补了孟加拉语NLP的空白，为低资源语言推理提供了高质量数据集和可扩展框架。

Abstract: Solving Bengali Math Word Problems (MWPs) remains a major challenge in
natural language processing (NLP) due to the language's low-resource status and
the multi-step reasoning required. Existing models struggle with complex
Bengali MWPs, largely because no human-annotated Bengali dataset has previously
addressed this task. This gap has limited progress in Bengali mathematical
reasoning. To address this, we created SOMADHAN, a dataset of 8792 complex
Bengali MWPs with manually written, step-by-step solutions. We designed this
dataset to support reasoning-focused evaluation and model development in a
linguistically underrepresented context. Using SOMADHAN, we evaluated a range
of large language models (LLMs) - including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA series
models, Deepseek, and Qwen - through both zero-shot and few-shot prompting with
and without Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. CoT prompting consistently
improved performance over standard prompting, especially in tasks requiring
multi-step logic. LLaMA-3.3 70B achieved the highest accuracy of 88% with
few-shot CoT prompting. We also applied Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune
models efficiently, enabling them to adapt to Bengali MWPs with minimal
computational cost. Our work fills a critical gap in Bengali NLP by providing a
high-quality reasoning dataset and a scalable framework for solving complex
MWPs. We aim to advance equitable research in low-resource languages and
enhance reasoning capabilities in educational and language technologies.

Conclusion: LLMs需个性化关系背景才能成为有效的人类沟通调解者。

Abstract: Conversational breakdowns in close relationships are deeply shaped by
personal histories and emotional context, yet most NLP research treats conflict
detection as a general task, overlooking the relational dynamics that influence
how messages are perceived. In this work, we leverage nonviolent communication
(NVC) theory to evaluate LLMs in detecting conversational breakdowns and
assessing how relationship backstory influences both human and model perception
of conflicts. Given the sensitivity and scarcity of real-world datasets
featuring conflict between familiar social partners with rich personal
backstories, we contribute the PersonaConflicts Corpus, a dataset of N=5,772
naturalistic simulated dialogues spanning diverse conflict scenarios between
friends, family members, and romantic partners. Through a controlled human
study, we annotate a subset of dialogues and obtain fine-grained labels of
communication breakdown types on individual turns, and assess the impact of
backstory on human and model perception of conflict in conversation. We find
that the polarity of relationship backstories significantly shifted human
perception of communication breakdowns and impressions of the social partners,
yet models struggle to meaningfully leverage those backstories in the detection
task. Additionally, we find that models consistently overestimate how
positively a message will make a listener feel. Our findings underscore the
critical role of personalization to relationship contexts in enabling LLMs to
serve as effective mediators in human communication for authentic connection.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce UI-Genie, a self-improving framework addressing
two key challenges in GUI agents: verification of trajectory outcome is
challenging and high-quality training data are not scalable. These challenges
are addressed by a reward model and a self-improving pipeline, respectively.
The reward model, UI-Genie-RM, features an image-text interleaved architecture
that efficiently pro- cesses historical context and unifies action-level and
task-level rewards. To sup- port the training of UI-Genie-RM, we develop
deliberately-designed data genera- tion strategies including rule-based
verification, controlled trajectory corruption, and hard negative mining. To
address the second challenge, a self-improvement pipeline progressively expands
solvable complex GUI tasks by enhancing both the agent and reward models
through reward-guided exploration and outcome verification in dynamic
environments. For training the model, we generate UI- Genie-RM-517k and
UI-Genie-Agent-16k, establishing the first reward-specific dataset for GUI
agents while demonstrating high-quality synthetic trajectory gen- eration
without manual annotation. Experimental results show that UI-Genie achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple GUI agent benchmarks with three
generations of data-model self-improvement. We open-source our complete

Result: 在工业规模数据集和在线A/B测试中取得显著效果，模型已在快手搜索中部署。

Conclusion: LaD模型在保持个性化信息的同时有效去毒，显著提升了QAC系统的性能。

Abstract: Query auto-completion (QAC) plays a crucial role in modern search systems.
However, in real-world applications, there are two pressing challenges that
still need to be addressed. First, there is a need for hierarchical
personalized representations for users. Previous approaches have typically used
users' search behavior as a single, overall representation, which proves
inadequate in more nuanced generative scenarios. Additionally, query prefixes
are typically short and may contain typos or sensitive information, increasing
the likelihood of generating toxic content compared to traditional text
generation tasks. Such toxic content can degrade user experience and lead to
public relations issues. Therefore, the second critical challenge is
detoxifying QAC systems.
  To address these two limitations, we propose a novel model (LaD) that
captures personalized information from both long-term and short-term interests,
incorporating adaptive detoxification. In LaD, personalized information is
captured hierarchically at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels. This
approach preserves as much personalized information as possible while enabling
online generation within time constraints. To move a futher step, we propose an
online training method based on Reject Preference Optimization (RPO). By
incorporating a special token [Reject] during both the training and inference
processes, the model achieves adaptive detoxification. Consequently, the
generated text presented to users is both non-toxic and relevant to the given
prefix. We conduct comprehensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets and
perform online A/B tests, delivering the largest single-experiment metric
improvement in nearly two years of our product. Our model has been deployed on
Kuaishou search, driving the primary traffic for hundreds of millions of active
users. The code is available at https://github.com/JXZe/LaD.

Conclusion: BiomedSQL为提升文本到SQL系统的科学推理能力提供了新基础。

Abstract: Biomedical researchers increasingly rely on large-scale structured databases
for complex analytical tasks. However, current text-to-SQL systems often
struggle to map qualitative scientific questions into executable SQL,
particularly when implicit domain reasoning is required. We introduce
BiomedSQL, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate scientific
reasoning in text-to-SQL generation over a real-world biomedical knowledge
base. BiomedSQL comprises 68,000 question/SQL query/answer triples grounded in
a harmonized BigQuery knowledge base that integrates gene-disease associations,
causal inference from omics data, and drug approval records. Each question
requires models to infer domain-specific criteria, such as genome-wide
significance thresholds, effect directionality, or trial phase filtering,
rather than rely on syntactic translation alone. We evaluate a range of open-
and closed-source LLMs across prompting strategies and interaction paradigms.
Our results reveal a substantial performance gap: GPT-o3-mini achieves 59.0%
execution accuracy, while our custom multi-step agent, BMSQL, reaches 62.6%,
both well below the expert baseline of 90.0%. BiomedSQL provides a new
foundation for advancing text-to-SQL systems capable of supporting scientific
discovery through robust reasoning over structured biomedical knowledge bases.

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in clinical narratives is essential for

combines heuristic filtering with Llama 3.3 to identify single-patient case
reports, followed by prompt-driven extraction using Llama 3.3 and DeepSeek R1,
resulting in over 5.6 million timestamped clinical events. To assess timeline
quality, we evaluate against a clinician-curated reference set using three
metrics: (i) event-level matching (80% match at a cosine similarity threshold
of 0.1), (ii) temporal concordance (c-index > 0.90), and (iii) Area Under the
Log-Time CDF (AULTC) for timestamp alignment. Corpus-level analysis shows wide
diagnostic and demographic coverage. In a downstream survival prediction task,
embeddings from extracted timelines achieve time-dependent concordance indices
up to 0.82 $\pm$ 0.01, demonstrating the predictive value of temporally
structured narratives. PMOA-TTS provides a scalable foundation for timeline

Abstract: In recent years, protein-text models have gained significant attention for
their potential in protein generation and understanding. Current approaches
focus on integrating protein-related knowledge into large language models
through continued pretraining and multi-modal alignment, enabling simultaneous
comprehension of textual descriptions and protein sequences. Through a thorough
analysis of existing model architectures and text-based protein understanding
benchmarks, we identify significant data leakage issues present in current
benchmarks. Moreover, conventional metrics derived from natural language
processing fail to accurately assess the model's performance in this domain. To
address these limitations, we reorganize existing datasets and introduce a
novel evaluation framework based on biological entities. Motivated by our

Result: 在slashdot.org的数据上验证了方法的通用性和灵活性，适用于多种对话理解任务。

Conclusion: Conversation Kernels是一种通用且灵活的框架，能够适应不同的对话理解任务。

Abstract: Understanding online conversations has attracted research attention with the
growth of social networks and online discussion forums. Content analysis of
posts and replies in online conversations is difficult because each individual
utterance is usually short and may implicitly refer to other posts within the
same conversation. Thus, understanding individual posts requires capturing the
conversational context and dependencies between different parts of a
conversation tree and then encoding the context dependencies between posts and
comments/replies into the language model.
  To this end, we propose a general-purpose mechanism to discover appropriate
conversational context for various aspects about an online post in a
conversation, such as whether it is informative, insightful, interesting or
funny. Specifically, we design two families of Conversation Kernels, which
explore different parts of the neighborhood of a post in the tree representing
the conversation and through this, build relevant conversational context that
is appropriate for each task being considered. We apply our developed method to
conversations crawled from slashdot.org, which allows users to apply highly
different labels to posts, such as 'insightful', 'funny', etc., and therefore
provides an ideal experimental platform to study whether a framework such as
Conversation Kernels is general-purpose and flexible enough to be adapted to
disparately different conversation understanding tasks.

Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby into a fully 'e'-less text. We experimented
with a range of techniques, from baseline methods like synonym replacement to
sophisticated generative models enhanced with beam search and named entity
analysis. We show that excluding up to 3.6% of the most common letters (up to
the letter 'u') had minimal impact on the text's meaning, although translation
fidelity rapidly and predictably decays with stronger lipogram constraints. Our
work highlights the surprising flexibility of English under strict constraints,

speakers. We outline our unique data collection approach, analyze its acoustic
diversity, and demonstrate its impact through finetuning experiments on
automatic speech recognition, averagely achieving 75.86% (Whisper), 52.06%

Conclusion: 结合TF-IDF和BERT的方法在西班牙语情感分类中表现优异，为提升客户反馈分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Classifying customer feedback into distinct emotion categories is essential
for understanding sentiment and improving customer experience. In this paper,
we classify customer feedback in Spanish into three emotion
categories--positive, neutral, and negative--using advanced NLP and ML
techniques. Traditional methods translate feedback from widely spoken languages
to less common ones, resulting in a loss of semantic integrity and contextual
nuances inherent to the original language. To address this limitation, we
propose a hybrid approach that combines TF-IDF with BERT embeddings,
effectively transforming Spanish text into rich numerical representations that
preserve the semantic depth of the original language by using a Custom Stacking
Ensemble (CSE) approach. To evaluate emotion classification, we utilize a range
of models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Bagging classifier with LGBM,
and AdaBoost. The CSE model combines these classifiers as base models and uses
a one-vs-all Logistic Regression as the meta-model. Our experimental results
demonstrate that CSE significantly outperforms the individual and BERT model,
achieving a test accuracy of 93.3% on the native Spanish dataset--higher than
the accuracy obtained from the translated version. These findings underscore
the challenges of emotion classification in Spanish and highlight the
advantages of combining vectorization techniques like TF-IDF with BERT for
improved accuracy. Our results provide valuable insights for businesses seeking

Method: 分析声学和语言多样性对ASR模型的影响，并测试声学增强方法在Librispeech数据集上的效果。

Result: 声学增强方法在960小时数据集上可将未见数据集的词错误率降低19.24%。

Conclusion: 声学增强是构建鲁棒ASR模型的有效替代方案，尤其适用于缺乏大规模语音数据的情况。

Abstract: Whisper's robust performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR) is often
attributed to its massive 680k-hour training set, an impractical scale for most
researchers. In this work, we examine how linguistic and acoustic diversity in
training data affect the robustness of the ASR model and reveal that
transcription generalization is primarily driven by acoustic variation rather
than linguistic richness. We find that targeted acoustic augmentation methods
could significantly improve the generalization ability of ASR models, reducing
word-error rates by up to 19.24 percent on unseen datasets when training on the
960-hour Librispeech dataset. These findings highlight strategic acoustically
focused data augmentation as a promising alternative to massive datasets for
building robust ASR models, offering a potential solution to future foundation
ASR models when massive human speech data is lacking.

Motivation: 在线极化对民主话语构成挑战，但现有研究多为单语言、文化狭隘或事件特定。POLAR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建POLAR数据集，标注极化的三个维度；微调多语言预训练模型，评估LLM在少样本和零样本场景下的表现。

Result: 模型在二元极化检测上表现良好，但在预测极化类型和表现形式上得分较低。

Conclusion: 极化具有高度情境性，需要更稳健、适应性强的方法。

Abstract: Online polarization poses a growing challenge for democratic discourse, yet
most computational social science research remains monolingual, culturally
narrow, or event-specific. We introduce POLAR, a multilingual, multicultural,
and multievent dataset with over 23k instances in seven languages from diverse
online platforms and real-world events. Polarization is annotated along three
axes: presence, type, and manifestation, using a variety of annotation
platforms adapted to each cultural context. We conduct two main experiments:
(1) we fine-tune six multilingual pretrained language models in both
monolingual and cross-lingual setups; and (2) we evaluate a range of open and
closed large language models (LLMs) in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.
Results show that while most models perform well on binary polarization
detection, they achieve substantially lower scores when predicting polarization
types and manifestations. These findings highlight the complex, highly
contextual nature of polarization and the need for robust, adaptable approaches
in NLP and computational social science. All resources will be released to
support further research and effective mitigation of digital polarization
globally.

Motivation: 解决手动将自然语言转换为信号时序逻辑（STL）的耗时和易错问题，同时填补自动转换领域缺乏数据集的空白。

Method: 1. 创建小规模种子集；2. 通过聚类和LLM生成多样化样本；3. 引入KGST框架，基于外部知识进行生成-优化转换。

Result: STL-DivEn数据集多样性优于现有数据集，KGST框架在转换准确性上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: STL-DivEn和KGST为NL-STL转换提供了有效的数据和方法支持。

Abstract: Temporal Logic (TL), especially Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enables precise
formal specification, making it widely used in cyber-physical systems such as
autonomous driving and robotics. Automatically transforming NL into STL is an
attractive approach to overcome the limitations of manual transformation, which
is time-consuming and error-prone. However, due to the lack of datasets,
automatic transformation currently faces significant challenges and has not
been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an NL-STL dataset named
STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), which comprises 16,000 samples enriched
with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a
small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are
identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in
generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured
through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation. Furthermore, we
introduce the Knowledge-Guided STL Transformation (KGST) framework, a novel
approach for transforming natural language into STL, involving a
generate-then-refine process based on external knowledge. Statistical analysis
shows that the STL-DivEn dataset exhibits more diversity than the existing
NL-STL dataset. Moreover, both metric-based and human evaluations indicate that
our KGST approach outperforms baseline models in transformation accuracy on
STL-DivEn and DeepSTL datasets.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have gained substantial attention due
to their impressive capabilities to complete tasks through multiple
interactions within GUI environments. However, existing agents primarily focus
on enhancing the accuracy of individual actions and often lack effective
mechanisms for detecting and recovering from errors. To address these
shortcomings, we propose the BacktrackAgent, a robust framework that
incorporates a backtracking mechanism to improve task completion efficiency.
BacktrackAgent includes verifier, judger, and reflector components as modules
for error detection and recovery, while also applying judgment rewards to
further enhance the agent's performance. Additionally, we develop a training
dataset specifically designed for the backtracking mechanism, which considers
the outcome pages after action executions. Experimental results show that
BacktrackAgent has achieved performance improvements in both task success rate
and step accuracy on Mobile3M and Auto-UI benchmarks. Our data and code will be

Abstract: What happens when an English Fairytaler is fine-tuned on Indian languages? We
evaluate how the English F5-TTS model adapts to 11 Indian languages, measuring
polyglot fluency, voice-cloning, style-cloning, and code-mixing. We compare:
(i) training from scratch, (ii) fine-tuning English F5 on Indian data, and
(iii) fine-tuning on both Indian and English data to prevent forgetting.
Fine-tuning with only Indian data proves most effective and the resultant IN-F5
is a near-human polyglot; that enables speakers of one language (e.g., Odia) to
fluently speak in another (e.g., Hindi). Our results show English pretraining
aids low-resource TTS in reaching human parity. To aid progress in other

Conclusion: RSCF通过保持语义一致性提升了知识图谱嵌入的性能，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: In knowledge graph embedding, leveraging relation-specific
entity-transformation has markedly enhanced performance. However, the
consistency of embedding differences before and after transformation remains
unaddressed, risking the loss of valuable inductive bias inherent in the
embeddings. This inconsistency stems from two problems. First, transformation
representations are specified for relations in a disconnected manner, allowing
dissimilar transformations and corresponding entity-embeddings for similar
relations. Second, a generalized plug-in approach as a SFBR (Semantic Filter
Based on Relations) disrupts this consistency through excessive concentration
of entity embeddings under entity-based regularization, generating
indistinguishable score distributions among relations. In this paper, we
introduce a plug-in KGE method, Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter (RSCF),
containing more consistent entity-transformation characterized by three
features: 1) shared affine transformation of relation embeddings across all
relations, 2) rooted entity-transformation that adds an entity embedding to its
change represented by the transformed vector, and 3) normalization of the
change to prevent scale reduction. To amplify the advantages of consistency
that preserve semantics on embeddings, RSCF adds relation transformation and
prediction modules for enhancing the semantics. In knowledge graph completion
tasks with distance-based and tensor decomposition models, RSCF significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art KGE methods, showing robustness across all
relations and their frequencies.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cross-lingual dubbing system that translates speech
from one language to another while preserving key characteristics such as
duration, speaker identity, and speaking speed. Despite the strong translation
quality of existing speech translation approaches, they often overlook the
transfer of speech patterns, leading to mismatches with source speech and
limiting their suitability for dubbing applications. To address this, we
propose a discrete diffusion-based speech-to-unit translation model with
explicit duration control, enabling time-aligned translation. We then
synthesize speech based on the predicted units and source identity with a
conditional flow matching model. Additionally, we introduce a unit-based speed
adaptation mechanism that guides the translation model to produce speech at a
rate consistent with the source, without relying on any text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework generates natural and fluent
translations that align with the original speech's duration and speaking pace,
while achieving competitive translation performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the task of targeted sentiment analysis (TSA),
which involves two sub-tasks, i.e., identifying specific aspects from reviews
and determining their corresponding sentiments. Aspect extraction forms the
foundation for sentiment prediction, highlighting the critical dependency
between these two tasks for effective cross-task knowledge transfer. While most
existing studies adopt a multi-task learning paradigm to align task-specific
features in the latent space, they predominantly rely on coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. Such approaches lack fine-grained control over
aspect-sentiment relationships, often assuming uniform sentiment polarity
within related aspects. This oversimplification neglects contextual cues that
differentiate sentiments, leading to negative transfer. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FCKT, a fine-grained cross-task knowledge transfer
framework tailored for TSA. By explicitly incorporating aspect-level
information into sentiment prediction, FCKT achieves fine-grained knowledge
transfer, effectively mitigating negative transfer and enhancing task
performance. Experiments on three datasets, including comparisons with various
baselines and large language models (LLMs), demonstrate the effectiveness of
FCKT. The source code is available on https://github.com/cwei01/FCKT.

Conclusion: 视觉线索对轮换预测至关重要，尤其是在可见交互中。

Abstract: Turn-taking is richly multimodal. Predictive turn-taking models (PTTMs)
facilitate naturalistic human-robot interaction, yet most rely solely on
speech. We introduce MM-VAP, a multimodal PTTM which combines speech with
visual cues including facial expression, head pose and gaze. We find that it
outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-only in videoconferencing interactions
(84% vs. 79% hold/shift prediction accuracy). Unlike prior work which
aggregates all holds and shifts, we group by duration of silence between turns.
This reveals that through the inclusion of visual features, MM-VAP outperforms
a state-of-the-art audio-only turn-taking model across all durations of speaker
transitions. We conduct a detailed ablation study, which reveals that facial
expression features contribute the most to model performance. Thus, our working
hypothesis is that when interlocutors can see one another, visual cues are
vital for turn-taking and must therefore be included for accurate turn-taking
prediction. We additionally validate the suitability of automatic speech
alignment for PTTM training using telephone speech. This work represents the
first comprehensive analysis of multimodal PTTMs. We discuss implications for
future work and make all code publicly available.

Conclusion: 多模态数据对隐式参数推理至关重要，iSRL-Qwen2-VL在性能上显著优于现有模型。

Abstract: Procedural texts help AI enhance reasoning about context and action
sequences. Transforming these into Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) improves
understanding of individual steps by identifying predicate-argument structure
like {verb,what,where/with}. Procedural instructions are highly elliptic, for
instance, (i) add cucumber to the bowl and (ii) add sliced tomatoes, the second
step's where argument is inferred from the context, referring to where the
cucumber was placed. Prior SRL benchmarks often miss implicit arguments,
leading to incomplete understanding. To address this, we introduce
Implicit-VidSRL, a dataset that necessitates inferring implicit and explicit
arguments from contextual information in multimodal cooking procedures. Our
proposed dataset benchmarks multimodal models' contextual reasoning, requiring
entity tracking through visual changes in recipes. We study recent multimodal
LLMs and reveal that they struggle to predict implicit arguments of what and
where/with from multi-modal procedural data given the verb. Lastly, we propose
iSRL-Qwen2-VL, which achieves a 17% relative improvement in F1-score for
what-implicit and a 14.7% for where/with-implicit semantic roles over GPT-4o.

Abstract: Spoken Grammatical Error Correction (SGEC) and Feedback (SGECF) are crucial
for second language learners, teachers and test takers. Traditional SGEC
systems rely on a cascaded pipeline consisting of an ASR, a module for
disfluency detection (DD) and removal and one for GEC. With the rise of
end-to-end (E2E) speech foundation models, we investigate their effectiveness
in SGEC and feedback generation. This work introduces a pseudo-labelling
process to address the challenge of limited labelled data, expanding the
training data size from 77 hours to approximately 2500 hours, leading to
improved performance. Additionally, we prompt an E2E Whisper-based SGEC model
with fluent transcriptions, showing a slight improvement in SGEC performance,
with more significant gains in feedback generation. Finally, we assess the
impact of increasing model size, revealing that while pseudo-labelled data does
not yield performance gain for a larger Whisper model, training with prompts

Abstract: The growing population of L2 English speakers has increased the demand for
developing automatic graders for spoken language assessment (SLA).
Historically, statistical models, text encoders, and self-supervised speech

the loss of information, while E2E graders also have limitations. With the
recent advancements of multi-modal large language models (LLMs), we aim to
explore their potential as L2 oral proficiency graders and overcome these
issues. In this work, we compare various training strategies using regression
and classification targets. Our results show that speech LLMs outperform all
previous competitive baselines, achieving superior performance on two datasets.
Furthermore, the trained grader demonstrates strong generalisation capabilities
in the cross-part or cross-task evaluation, facilitated by the audio

Abstract: Radiology reports convey detailed clinical observations and capture
diagnostic reasoning that evolves over time. However, existing evaluation
methods are limited to single-report settings and rely on coarse metrics that
fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and temporal dependencies. We
introduce LUNGUAGE,a benchmark dataset for structured radiology report
generation that supports both single-report evaluation and longitudinal
patient-level assessment across multiple studies. It contains 1,473 annotated
chest X-ray reports, each reviewed by experts, and 80 of them contain
longitudinal annotations to capture disease progression and inter-study
intervals, also reviewed by experts. Using this benchmark, we develop a
two-stage framework that transforms generated reports into fine-grained,
schema-aligned structured representations, enabling longitudinal
interpretation. We also propose LUNGUAGESCORE, an interpretable metric that
compares structured outputs at the entity, relation, and attribute level while
modeling temporal consistency across patient timelines. These contributions
establish the first benchmark dataset, structuring framework, and evaluation
metric for sequential radiology reporting, with empirical results demonstrating

generation, category induction, and typicality judgment. Our findings show a
low alignment between humans and LLMs, consistent with previous studies.
However, their performance varies notably across different semantic domains.
Ultimately, this study highlights both the promises and the constraints of
using AI-generated exemplars to support psychological and linguistic research.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视韩语及其语音特性，且多集中于数据集构建而非架构防御。

Method: 提出PHISH（利用韩语语音特性）和MESH（在架构层面融合语义和语音特征）。

Result: 实验表明方法在扰动和非扰动数据集上均有效，提升检测性能并反映真实对抗行为。

Conclusion: PHISH和MESH能有效应对韩语中的语音替换攻击，增强检测鲁棒性。

Abstract: As malicious users increasingly employ phonetic substitution to evade hate
speech detection, researchers have investigated such strategies. However, two
key challenges remain. First, existing studies have overlooked the Korean
language, despite its vulnerability to phonetic perturbations due to its
phonographic nature. Second, prior work has primarily focused on constructing
datasets rather than developing architectural defenses. To address these
challenges, we propose (1) PHonetic-Informed Substitution for Hangul (PHISH)
that exploits the phonological characteristics of the Korean writing system,
and (2) Mixed Encoding of Semantic-pHonetic features (MESH) that enhances the
detector's robustness by incorporating phonetic information at the
architectural level. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methods on both perturbed and unperturbed datasets, suggesting
that they not only improve detection performance but also reflect realistic
adversarial behaviors employed by malicious users.

Motivation: 传统信息检索模型难以有效遵循用户指令，因此需要专门的数据集和模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 构建包含38,000个<指令,查询,段落>三元组的InF-IR语料库，生成硬负样本并通过对比学习训练InF-Embed模型。

Result: InF-Embed在五个指令检索基准上比基线模型性能提升8.1%（p-MRR）。

Conclusion: InF-IR和InF-Embed为指令跟随检索提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Modern information retrieval (IR) models, trained exclusively on standard
<query, passage> pairs, struggle to effectively interpret and follow explicit
user instructions. We introduce InF-IR, a large-scale, high-quality training
corpus tailored for enhancing retrieval models in Instruction-Following IR.
InF-IR expands traditional training pairs into over 38,000 expressive
<instruction, query, passage> triplets as positive samples. In particular, for
each positive triplet, we generate two additional hard negative examples by
poisoning both instructions and queries, then rigorously validated by an
advanced reasoning model (o3-mini) to ensure semantic plausibility while
maintaining instructional incorrectness. Unlike existing corpora that primarily
support computationally intensive reranking tasks for decoder-only language
models, the highly contrastive positive-negative triplets in InF-IR further
enable efficient representation learning for smaller encoder-only models,
facilitating direct embedding-based retrieval. Using this corpus, we train
InF-Embed, an instruction-aware Embedding model optimized through contrastive
learning and instruction-query attention mechanisms to align retrieval outcomes
precisely with user intents. Extensive experiments across five
instruction-based retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that InF-Embed significantly
surpasses competitive baselines by 8.1% in p-MRR, measuring the
instruction-following capabilities.

Method: 构建CRUST-Bench数据集，包含C仓库、安全Rust接口和测试用例，并评估LLM在此任务上的表现。

Result: LLM在生成安全和惯用的Rust代码方面仍面临挑战，最佳模型OpenAI o1仅能解决15个任务。

Conclusion: CRUST-Bench为改进转译系统提供了基准，未来需提升LLM处理复杂场景的能力。

Abstract: C-to-Rust transpilation is essential for modernizing legacy C code while
enhancing safety and interoperability with modern Rust ecosystems. However, no
dataset currently exists for evaluating whether a system can transpile C into
safe Rust that passes a set of test cases. We introduce CRUST-Bench, a dataset
of 100 C repositories, each paired with manually-written interfaces in safe
Rust as well as test cases that can be used to validate correctness of the
transpilation. By considering entire repositories rather than isolated
functions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects
with dependencies across multiple files. The provided Rust interfaces provide
explicit specifications that ensure adherence to idiomatic, memory-safe Rust
patterns, while the accompanying test cases enforce functional correctness. We
evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on this task and find
that safe and idiomatic Rust generation is still a challenging problem for
various state-of-the-art methods and techniques. We also provide insights into
the errors LLMs usually make in transpiling code from C to safe Rust. The best
performing model, OpenAI o1, is able to solve only 15 tasks in a single-shot
setting. Improvements on CRUST-Bench would lead to improved transpilation
systems that can reason about complex scenarios and help in migrating legacy
codebases from C into languages like Rust that ensure memory safety. You can

Motivation: 探索聊天机器人如何通过不同的关系框架（熟悉或陌生）影响用户的自我披露行为。

Method: 采用混合因子设计，参与者与熟悉型或陌生型聊天机器人互动，分别进行情感和事实披露任务。

Result: 陌生型在情感披露时更舒适；熟悉型在事实披露后更受欢迎，提供匿名感和减少评判。

Conclusion: 聊天机器人框架需根据披露类型（情感或事实）调整，以优化用户体验。

Abstract: Self-disclosure, the sharing of one's thoughts and feelings, is affected by
the perceived relationship between individuals. While chatbots are increasingly
used for self-disclosure, the impact of a chatbot's framing on users'
self-disclosure remains under-explored. We investigated how a chatbot's
description of its relationship with users, particularly in terms of
ephemerality, affects self-disclosure. Specifically, we compared a Familiar
chatbot, presenting itself as a companion remembering past interactions, with a
Stranger chatbot, presenting itself as a new, unacquainted entity in each
conversation. In a mixed factorial design, participants engaged with either the
Familiar or Stranger chatbot in two sessions across two days, with one
conversation focusing on Emotional- and another Factual-disclosure. When
Emotional-disclosure was sought in the first chatting session,
Stranger-condition participants felt more comfortable self-disclosing. However,
when Factual-disclosure was sought first, these differences were replaced by
more enjoyment among Familiar-condition participants. Qualitative findings
showed Stranger afforded anonymity and reduced judgement, whereas Familiar
sometimes felt intrusive unless rapport was built via low-risk
Factual-disclosure.

Conclusion: GAN架构在引用意图分类中高效且有效；引用意图对论文影响力评估有重要影响。

Abstract: Citations play a fundamental role in the scientific ecosystem, serving as a
foundation for tracking the flow of knowledge, acknowledging prior work, and
assessing scholarly influence. In scientometrics, they are also central to the
construction of quantitative indicators. Not all citations, however, serve the
same function: some provide background, others introduce methods, or compare
results. Therefore, understanding citation intent allows for a more nuanced
interpretation of scientific impact. In this paper, we adopted a GAN-based
method to classify citation intents. Our results revealed that the proposed
method achieves competitive classification performance, closely matching
state-of-the-art results with substantially fewer parameters. This demonstrates
the effectiveness and efficiency of leveraging GAN architectures combined with
contextual embeddings in intent classification task. We also investigated
whether filtering citation intents affects the centrality of papers in citation
networks. Analyzing the network constructed from the unArXiv dataset, we found
that paper rankings can be significantly influenced by citation intent. All
four centrality metrics examined- degree, PageRank, closeness, and betweenness
- were sensitive to the filtering of citation types. The betweenness centrality
displayed the greatest sensitivity, showing substantial changes in ranking when
specific citation intents were removed.

jointly optimizing image clarity and linguistic consistency. First, we generate
synthetic image pairs with randomized text fonts, layouts, and degradations. An
image restoration model is trained on this synthetic data, using
multi-directional patch extraction and fusion to process large images. Second,
a ByT5 post-corrector, fine-tuned on synthetic historical text training pairs,
addresses any remaining OCR errors. Detailed experiments on 13,831 pages of
real historical documents in English, French, and Spanish show that PreP-OCR
pipeline reduces character error rates by 63.9-70.3\% compared to OCR on raw

Conclusion: 这是首个针对中文网络欺凌事件检测的研究，数据集为相关任务提供了基准。

Abstract: Existing cyberbullying detection benchmarks were organized by the polarity of
speech, such as "offensive" and "non-offensive", which were essentially hate
speech detection. However, in the real world, cyberbullying often attracted
widespread social attention through incidents. To address this problem, we
propose a novel annotation method to construct a cyberbullying dataset that
organized by incidents. The constructed CHNCI is the first Chinese
cyberbullying incident detection dataset, which consists of 220,676 comments in
91 incidents. Specifically, we first combine three cyberbullying detection
methods based on explanations generation as an ensemble method to generate the
pseudo labels, and then let human annotators judge these labels. Then we
propose the evaluation criteria for validating whether it constitutes a
cyberbullying incident. Experimental results demonstrate that the constructed
dataset can be a benchmark for the tasks of cyberbullying detection and
incident prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study for
the Chinese cyberbullying incident detection task.

Conclusion: 上下文信息对传统模型（如CNN和LSTM）有益，但对ChatGPT无效，建议针对特定任务优化模型。

Abstract: The increasing volume of online discussions requires advanced automatic
content moderation to maintain responsible discourse. While hate speech
detection on social media is well-studied, research on German-language
newspaper forums remains limited. Existing studies often neglect
platform-specific context, such as user history and article themes. This paper
addresses this gap by developing and evaluating binary classification models
for automatic content moderation in German newspaper forums, incorporating
contextual information. Using LSTM, CNN, and ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo, and leveraging
the One Million Posts Corpus from the Austrian newspaper Der Standard, we
assess the impact of context-aware models. Results show that CNN and LSTM
models benefit from contextual information and perform competitively with
state-of-the-art approaches. In contrast, ChatGPT's zero-shot classification
does not improve with added context and underperforms.

Abstract: The way speakers articulate is well known to be variable across individuals
while at the same time subject to anatomical and biomechanical constraints. In
this study, we ask whether articulatory strategy in vowel production can be
sufficiently speaker-specific to form the basis for speaker discrimination. We
conducted Generalised Procrustes Analyses of tongue shape data from 40 English
speakers from the North West of England, and assessed the
speaker-discriminatory potential of orthogonal tongue shape features within the
framework of likelihood ratios. Tongue size emerged as the individual dimension
with the strongest discriminatory power, while tongue shape variation in the
more anterior part of the tongue generally outperformed tongue shape variation
in the posterior part. When considered in combination, shape-only information
may offer comparable levels of speaker specificity to size-and-shape
information, but only when features do not exhibit speaker-level co-variation.

Abstract: Decoding speech directly from neural activity is a central goal in
brain-computer interface (BCI) research. In recent years, exciting advances
have been made through the growing use of intracranial field potential
recordings, such as stereo-ElectroEncephaloGraphy (sEEG) and
ElectroCorticoGraphy (ECoG). These neural signals capture rich population-level
activity but present key challenges: (i) task-relevant neural signals are
sparsely distributed across sEEG electrodes, and (ii) they are often entangled
with task-irrelevant neural signals in both sEEG and ECoG. To address these
challenges, we introduce a unified Coarse-to-Fine neural disentanglement
framework, BrainStratify, which includes (i) identifying functional groups
through spatial-context-guided temporal-spatial modeling, and (ii)
disentangling distinct neural dynamics within the target functional group using
Decoupled Product Quantization (DPQ). We evaluate BrainStratify on two
open-source sEEG datasets and one (epidural) ECoG dataset, spanning tasks like
vocal production and speech perception. Extensive experiments show that
BrainStratify, as a unified framework for decoding speech from intracranial
neural signals, significantly outperforms previous decoding methods. Overall,
by combining data-driven stratification with neuroscience-inspired modularity,
BrainStratify offers a robust and interpretable solution for speech decoding
from intracranial recordings.

Abstract: We investigate optimal strategies for decoding perceived natural speech from
fMRI data acquired from a limited number of participants. Leveraging Lebel et
al. (2023)'s dataset of 8 participants, we first demonstrate the effectiveness
of training deep neural networks to predict LLM-derived text representations
from fMRI activity. Then, in this data regime, we observe that multi-subject
training does not improve decoding accuracy compared to single-subject
approach. Furthermore, training on similar or different stimuli across subjects
has a negligible effect on decoding accuracy. Finally, we find that our
decoders better model syntactic than semantic features, and that stories
containing sentences with complex syntax or rich semantic content are more
challenging to decode. While our results demonstrate the benefits of having
extensive data per participant (deep phenotyping), they suggest that leveraging
multi-subject for natural speech decoding likely requires deeper phenotyping or
a substantially larger cohort.

reasons for indefiniteness. We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic
pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness. A human
validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality
annotations. To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement
an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every
model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason. We show that LLM agents
based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression
baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify
the underlying reasons. PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI
researchers, enabling the development of advanced examination models. We will

Abstract: Understanding perspective is fundamental to human visual perception, yet the
extent to which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) internalize
perspective geometry remains unclear. We introduce MMPerspective, the first
benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding
of perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary
dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark
comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083
question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point
perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship
understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving
transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art
MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence
on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning
and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further
reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective
capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of
chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for
diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems.

Conclusion: TACO在多模态推理中表现出色，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: DeepSeek R1 has significantly advanced complex reasoning for large language
models (LLMs). While recent methods have attempted to replicate R1's reasoning
capabilities in multimodal settings, they face limitations, including
inconsistencies between reasoning and final answers, model instability and
crashes during long-chain exploration, and low data learning efficiency. To
address these challenges, we propose TACO, a novel reinforcement learning
algorithm for visual reasoning. Building on Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO), TACO introduces Think-Answer Consistency, which tightly
couples reasoning with answer consistency to ensure answers are grounded in
thoughtful reasoning. We also introduce the Rollback Resample Strategy, which
adaptively removes problematic samples and reintroduces them to the sampler,
enabling stable long-chain exploration and future learning opportunities.
Additionally, TACO employs an adaptive learning schedule that focuses on
moderate difficulty samples to optimize data efficiency. Furthermore, we
propose the Test-Time-Resolution-Scaling scheme to address performance
degradation due to varying resolutions during reasoning while balancing
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution benchmarks for REC and VQA tasks show that fine-tuning
LVLMs leads to significant performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型（AV-LLMs）中因音频、视频和语言复杂交互导致的幻觉问题。

Method: 提出Audio-Visual Contrastive Decoding (AVCD)，利用注意力分布动态识别主导模态并应用掩蔽生成扰动输出对数，同时引入熵引导的自适应解码以提高效率。

Result: 在AVHBench数据集上，AVCD显著提升了VideoLLaMA2和video-SALMONN的准确性（分别提高6%和11%）。

Conclusion: AVCD是一种高效且鲁棒的训练免费解码框架，适用于多模态交互场景。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a major challenge in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). To address this, various contrastive decoding (CD) methods have been
proposed that contrasts original logits with hallucinated logits generated from
perturbed inputs. While CD has shown promise in vision-language models (VLMs),
it is not well-suited for AV-LLMs, where hallucinations often emerge from both
unimodal and cross-modal combinations involving audio, video, and language.
These intricate interactions call for a more adaptive and modality-aware
decoding strategy. In this paper, we propose Audio-Visual Contrastive Decoding
(AVCD)-a novel, training-free decoding framework designed to model trimodal
interactions and suppress modality-induced hallucinations in AV-LLMs. Unlike
previous CD methods in VLMs that corrupt a fixed modality, AVCD leverages
attention distributions to dynamically identify less dominant modalities and
applies attentive masking to generate perturbed output logits. To support CD in
a trimodal setting, we also reformulate the original CD framework to jointly
handle audio, visual, and textual inputs. Finally, to improve efficiency, we
introduce entropy-guided adaptive decoding, which selectively skips unnecessary
decoding steps based on the model's confidence in its predictions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AVCD consistently outperforms existing decoding
methods. Especially, on the AVHBench dataset, it improves accuracy by 6% for
VideoLLaMA2 and 11% for video-SALMONN, demonstrating strong robustness and
generalizability.

Conclusion: LPOI是一种高效且无需额外标注的列表偏好优化方法，显著减少VLMs的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Aligning large VLMs with human preferences is a challenging task, as methods
like RLHF and DPO often overfit to textual information or exacerbate
hallucinations. Although augmenting negative image samples partially addresses
these pitfalls, no prior work has employed listwise preference optimization for
VLMs, due to the complexity and cost of constructing listwise image samples. In
this work, we propose LPOI, the first object-aware listwise preference
optimization developed for reducing hallucinations in VLMs. LPOI identifies and
masks a critical object in the image, and then interpolates the masked region
between the positive and negative images to form a sequence of incrementally
more complete images. The model is trained to rank these images in ascending
order of object visibility, effectively reducing hallucinations while retaining
visual fidelity. LPOI requires no extra annotations beyond standard pairwise
preference data, as it automatically constructs the ranked lists through object
masking and interpolation. Comprehensive experiments on MMHalBench, AMBER, and
Object HalBench confirm that LPOI outperforms existing preference optimization
methods in reducing hallucinations and enhancing VLM performance. We make the
code available at https://github.com/fatemehpesaran310/lpoi.

Conclusion: HoliTom展示了高效视频LLM推理的潜力，内外结合策略优于单一方法。

Abstract: Video large language models (video LLMs) excel at video comprehension but
face significant computational inefficiency due to redundant video tokens.
Existing token pruning methods offer solutions. However, approaches operating
within the LLM (inner-LLM pruning), such as FastV, incur intrinsic
computational overhead in shallow layers. In contrast, methods performing token
pruning before the LLM (outer-LLM pruning) primarily address spatial redundancy
within individual frames or limited temporal windows, neglecting the crucial
global temporal dynamics and correlations across longer video sequences. This
leads to sub-optimal spatio-temporal reduction and does not leverage video
compressibility fully. Crucially, the synergistic potential and mutual
influence of combining these strategies remain unexplored. To further reduce
redundancy, we introduce HoliTom, a novel training-free holistic token merging
framework. HoliTom employs outer-LLM pruning through global redundancy-aware
temporal segmentation, followed by spatial-temporal merging to reduce visual
tokens by over 90%, significantly alleviating the LLM's computational burden.
Complementing this, we introduce a robust inner-LLM token similarity-based
merging approach, designed for superior performance and compatibility with
outer-LLM pruning. Evaluations demonstrate our method's promising
efficiency-performance trade-off on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, reducing computational
costs to 6.9% of FLOPs while maintaining 99.1% of the original performance.
Furthermore, we achieve a 2.28x reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and a
1.32x acceleration in decoding throughput, highlighting the practical benefits
of our integrated pruning approach for efficient video LLMs inference.

Conclusion: 通过融合骨骼拓扑结构，有效解决了Mamba模型在人体结构关系建模中的局限性，同时保持高效性。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods for 3-D human pose estimation face significant
computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of self-attention
mechanism complexity with sequence length. Recently, the Mamba model has
substantially reduced computational overhead and demonstrated outstanding
performance in modeling long sequences by leveraging state space model (SSM).
However, the ability of SSM to process sequential data is not suitable for 3-D
joint sequences with topological structures, and the causal convolution
structure in Mamba also lacks insight into local joint relationships. To
address these issues, we propose the Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion framework in
this paper. Specifically, the proposed Bone Aware Module infers the direction
and length of bone vectors in the spherical coordinate system, providing
effective topological guidance for the Mamba model in processing joint
sequences. Furthermore, we enhance the convolutional structure within the Mamba
model by integrating forward and backward graph convolutional network, enabling
it to better capture local joint dependencies. Finally, we design a
Spatiotemporal Refinement Module to model both temporal and spatial
relationships within the sequence. Through the incorporation of skeletal
topology, our approach effectively alleviates Mamba's limitations in capturing
human structural relationships. We conduct extensive experiments on the
Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets for testing and comparison, and the results
show that the proposed method greatly reduces computational cost while
achieving higher accuracy. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of each proposed module. The code and models will be released.

Conclusion: HIEVT在复杂指令和动态目标场景下具有显著优势。

Abstract: User-Centric Embodied Visual Tracking (UC-EVT) presents a novel challenge for
reinforcement learning-based models due to the substantial gap between
high-level user instructions and low-level agent actions. While recent
advancements in language models (e.g., LLMs, VLMs, VLAs) have improved
instruction comprehension, these models face critical limitations in either
inference speed (LLMs, VLMs) or generalizability (VLAs) for UC-EVT tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Hierarchical Instruction-aware
Embodied Visual Tracking (HIEVT)} agent, which bridges instruction
comprehension and action generation using \textit{spatial goals} as
intermediaries. HIEVT first introduces \textit{LLM-based Semantic-Spatial Goal
Aligner} to translate diverse human instructions into spatial goals that
directly annotate the desired spatial position. Then the \textit{RL-based
Adaptive Goal-Aligned Policy}, a general offline policy, enables the tracker to
position the target as specified by the spatial goal. To benchmark UC-EVT
tasks, we collect over ten million trajectories for training and evaluate
across one seen environment and nine unseen challenging environments. Extensive
experiments and real-world deployments demonstrate the robustness and
generalizability of HIEVT across diverse environments, varying target dynamics,
and complex instruction combinations. The complete project is available at

Conclusion: PLUM为LMM的细粒度视觉理解提供了新方向，解决了部分定位的关键问题。

Abstract: Real-world objects are composed of distinctive, object-specific parts.
Identifying these parts is key to performing fine-grained, compositional
reasoning-yet, large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to perform this
seemingly straightforward task. In this work, we introduce PARTONOMY, an LMM
benchmark designed for pixel-level part grounding. We construct PARTONOMY from
existing part datasets and our own rigorously annotated set of images,
encompassing 862 part labels and 534 object labels for evaluation. Unlike
existing datasets that simply ask models to identify generic parts, PARTONOMY
uses specialized concepts (e.g., agricultural airplane), and challenges models
to compare objects' parts, consider part-whole relationships, and justify
textual predictions with visual segmentations. Our experiments demonstrate
significant limitations in state-of-the-art LMMs (e.g., LISA-13B achieves only
5.9% gIoU), highlighting a critical gap in their part grounding abilities. We
note that existing segmentation-enabled LMMs (segmenting LMMs) have two key
architectural shortcomings: they use special [SEG] tokens not seen during
pretraining which induce distribution shift, and they discard predicted
segmentations instead of using past predictions to guide future ones. To
address these deficiencies, we train several part-centric LMMs and propose
PLUM, a novel segmenting LMM that uses span tagging instead of segmentation
tokens and that conditions on prior predictions in a feedback loop. We find
that pretrained PLUM outperforms existing segmenting LMMs on reasoning
segmentation, VQA, and visual hallucination benchmarks. In addition, PLUM
finetuned on our proposed Explanatory Part Segmentation task is competitive
with segmenting LMMs trained on significantly more segmentation data. Our work
opens up new avenues towards enabling fine-grained, grounded visual
understanding in LMMs.

Abstract: Internal representations are crucial for understanding deep neural networks,

the former, existing approaches often rely on crude approximations. We propose

excellent reconstruction capabilities. Through qualitative comparisons and

Abstract: State Space models (SSMs) such as PointMamba enable efficient feature
extraction for point cloud self-supervised learning with linear complexity,
outperforming Transformers in computational efficiency. However, existing
PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking,
which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose
ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a
simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing
spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point
tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in
self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese
Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate
reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens.
This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust
global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights
significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on
ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for
classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for

Conclusion: CAAC通过置信度驱动的调整，有效减少幻觉并保持视觉对齐，适用于长文本生成场景。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve impressive performance on
multimodal tasks but often suffer from hallucination, and confidently describe
objects or attributes not present in the image. Current inference-time
interventions, while training-free, struggle to maintain accuracy in open-ended
and long-form generation scenarios. We introduce the Confidence-Aware Attention
Calibration (CAAC) framework to address this challenge by targeting two key
biases: spatial perception bias, which distributes attention disproportionately
across image tokens, and modality bias, which shifts focus from visual to
textual inputs over time. CAAC employs a two-step approach: Visual-Token
Calibration (VTC) to balance attention across visual tokens, and Adaptive
Attention Re-Scaling (AAR) to reinforce visual grounding based on the model's
confidence. This confidence-driven adjustment ensures consistent visual
alignment during generation. Experiments on CHAIR, AMBER, and POPE benchmarks
demonstrate that CAAC outperforms baselines, particularly in long-form
generations, effectively reducing hallucination.

Conclusion: FOA-Attack通过全局和局部特征对齐显著提升了对抗样本的迁移能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain vulnerable to transferable
adversarial examples. While existing methods typically achieve targeted attacks
by aligning global features-such as CLIP's [CLS] token-between adversarial and
target samples, they often overlook the rich local information encoded in patch
tokens. This leads to suboptimal alignment and limited transferability,
particularly for closed-source models. To address this limitation, we propose a
targeted transferable adversarial attack method based on feature optimal
alignment, called FOA-Attack, to improve adversarial transfer capability.
Specifically, at the global level, we introduce a global feature loss based on
cosine similarity to align the coarse-grained features of adversarial samples
with those of target samples. At the local level, given the rich local
representations within Transformers, we leverage clustering techniques to
extract compact local patterns to alleviate redundant local features. We then
formulate local feature alignment between adversarial and target samples as an
optimal transport (OT) problem and propose a local clustering optimal transport
loss to refine fine-grained feature alignment. Additionally, we propose a
dynamic ensemble model weighting strategy to adaptively balance the influence
of multiple models during adversarial example generation, thereby further
improving transferability. Extensive experiments across various models
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods, especially in transferring to closed-source MLLMs.

pre-trained models (PTMs), such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training
(CLIP) model, has inspired a range of CL methods targeting new and specialized
tasks, providing rich multi-modal embeddings that support lightweight,
incremental prompt tuning. Existing methods often rely on complex designs built
upon specific assumptions, such as intricate regularization schemes for prompt
pools, specialized routing mechanisms, or multi-stage incrementations, that
introduce additional-and possibly unnecessary-complexity, underutilizing CLIP's
intrinsic capabilities. In this paper, we propose a concise CL approach for
CLIP based on incremental prompt tuning that fully exploits its multi-modal
structure and the stability of textual representations. Our method, Textual
Prototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), introduces textual prototypes not merely
as static classifiers, as in existing methods, but as stable anchors to guide
the learning of visual prompts, thereby shaping the embedding space (i.e.,
TPPT-V). We show that our bidirectional supervision strategy enables more
effective learning of new knowledge while reducing forgetting. To further close
the vision-language gap during CL, we jointly optimizes visual and textual
prompts (i.e., TPPT-VT). We also introduce a relational diversity
regularization on the textual anchors to prevent embedding space collapse and
mitigate correlated forgetting. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting the benefits of
leveraging CLIP's intrinsic guidance for continual adaptation.

Conclusion: 该方法填补了基础视觉能力与通用问答之间的差距，提升了LMMs的可信度和可追溯性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable visual
understanding performance on both vision-language and vision-centric tasks.
However, they often fall short in integrating advanced, task-specific
capabilities for compositional reasoning, which hinders their progress toward
truly competent general vision models. To address this, we present a unified
visual reasoning mechanism that enables LMMs to solve complicated compositional
problems by leveraging their intrinsic capabilities (e.g. grounding and visual
understanding capabilities). Different from the previous shortcut learning
mechanism, our approach introduces a human-like
understanding-thinking-answering process, allowing the model to complete all
steps in a single pass forwarding without the need for multiple inferences or
external tools. This design bridges the gap between foundational visual
capabilities and general question answering, encouraging LMMs to generate
faithful and traceable responses for complex visual reasoning. Meanwhile, we
curate 334K visual instruction samples covering both general scenes and
text-rich scenes and involving multiple foundational visual capabilities. Our
trained model, Griffon-R, has the ability of end-to-end automatic
understanding, self-thinking, and reasoning answers. Comprehensive experiments
show that Griffon-R not only achieves advancing performance on complex visual
reasoning benchmarks including VSR and CLEVR, but also enhances multimodal
capabilities across various benchmarks like MMBench and ScienceQA. Data,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AV-LLMs中音频和视频特征联合处理可能导致模态偏差，即模型过度依赖某一模态。

Method: FMD在推理阶段先分别处理音频和视频输入（分支阶段），再合并隐藏状态进行联合推理（合并阶段）。

Result: 在VideoLLaMA2和video-SALMONN上实验，任务性能一致提升。

Conclusion: FMD通过推理阶段干预有效提升多模态理解的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The goal of this work is to enhance balanced multimodal understanding in
audio-visual large language models (AV-LLMs) by addressing modality bias
without requiring additional training. In current AV-LLMs, audio and video
features are typically processed jointly in the decoder. While this strategy
facilitates unified multimodal understanding, it may introduce modality bias,
where the model tends to over-rely on one modality due to imbalanced training
signals. To mitigate this, we propose Fork-Merge Decoding (FMD), a simple yet
effective inference-time strategy that requires no additional training or
architectural modifications. FMD first performs modality-specific reasoning by
processing audio-only and video-only inputs through the early decoder layers (a
fork phase), and then merges the resulting hidden states for joint reasoning in
the remaining layers (a merge phase). This approach promotes balanced modality
contributions and leverages complementary information across modalities. We
evaluate our method on two representative AV-LLMs, VideoLLaMA2 and
video-SALMONN, using three benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
consistent performance improvements on tasks focused on audio, video, and
combined audio-visual reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of
inference-time interventions for robust multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: ATD通过语言形式高效想象关键语义，结合LLM推理能力和导航模型专长，显著提升导航性能。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires the agent to navigate by
following natural instructions under partial observability, making it difficult
to align perception with language. Recent methods mitigate this by imagining
future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high
computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively
imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more
reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive
Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a
large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain
architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the
right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To
achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently
activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of
logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce
a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject
them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the
reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We
conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves
state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. The code is

Conclusion: DualParal策略有效解决了长视频生成的高延迟和内存问题，为高效视频生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based video diffusion models generate
high-quality videos at scale but incur prohibitive processing latency and
memory costs for long videos. To address this, we propose a novel distributed
inference strategy, termed DualParal. The core idea is that, instead of
generating an entire video on a single GPU, we parallelize both temporal frames
and model layers across GPUs. However, a naive implementation of this division
faces a key limitation: since diffusion models require synchronized noise
levels across frames, this implementation leads to the serialization of
original parallelisms. We leverage a block-wise denoising scheme to handle
this. Namely, we process a sequence of frame blocks through the pipeline with
progressively decreasing noise levels. Each GPU handles a specific block and
layer subset while passing previous results to the next GPU, enabling
asynchronous computation and communication. To further optimize performance, we
incorporate two key enhancements. Firstly, a feature cache is implemented on
each GPU to store and reuse features from the prior block as context,
minimizing inter-GPU communication and redundant computation. Secondly, we
employ a coordinated noise initialization strategy, ensuring globally
consistent temporal dynamics by sharing initial noise patterns across GPUs
without extra resource costs. Together, these enable fast, artifact-free, and
infinitely long video generation. Applied to the latest diffusion transformer
video generator, our method efficiently produces 1,025-frame videos with up to
6.54$\times$ lower latency and 1.48$\times$ lower memory cost on 8$\times$RTX
4090 GPUs.

Conclusion: Uni3D-MoE通过自适应多模态融合显著提升了3D场景理解的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated considerable potential for comprehensive 3D scene understanding.
However, existing approaches typically utilize only one or a limited subset of
3D modalities, resulting in incomplete representations of 3D scenes and reduced
interpretive accuracy. Furthermore, different types of queries inherently
depend on distinct modalities, indicating that uniform processing of all
modality tokens may fail to effectively capture query-specific context. To
address these challenges, we propose Uni3D-MoE, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE)-based 3D MLLM designed to enable adaptive 3D multimodal fusion.
Specifically, Uni3D-MoE integrates a comprehensive set of 3D modalities,
including multi-view RGB and depth images, bird's-eye-view (BEV) maps, point
clouds, and voxel representations. At its core, our framework employs a
learnable routing mechanism within the sparse MoE-based large language model,
dynamically selecting appropriate experts at the token level. Each expert
specializes in processing multimodal tokens based on learned modality
preferences, thus facilitating flexible collaboration tailored to diverse
task-specific requirements. Extensive evaluations on standard 3D scene
understanding benchmarks and specialized datasets demonstrate the efficacy of
Uni3D-MoE.

Conclusion: Video-Holmes可作为多模态推理的“Holmes测试”，推动模型更接近人类推理能力，并突显该领域的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in CoT reasoning and RL post-training have been reported to
enhance video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This progress naturally raises a
question: can these models perform complex video reasoning in a manner
comparable to human experts? However, existing video benchmarks primarily
evaluate visual perception and grounding abilities, with questions that can be
answered based on explicit prompts or isolated visual cues. Such benchmarks do
not fully capture the intricacies of real-world reasoning, where humans must
actively search for, integrate, and analyze multiple clues before reaching a
conclusion. To address this issue, we present Video-Holmes, a benchmark
inspired by the reasoning process of Sherlock Holmes, designed to evaluate the
complex video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Video-Holmes consists of 1,837
questions derived from 270 manually annotated suspense short films, which spans
seven carefully designed tasks. Each task is constructed by first identifying
key events and causal relationships within films, and then designing questions
that require models to actively locate and connect multiple relevant visual
clues scattered across different video segments. Our comprehensive evaluation
of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals that, while these models generally excel at
visual perception, they encounter substantial difficulties with integrating
information and often miss critical clues. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves an accuracy of only 45%, with most models
scoring below 40%. We aim that Video-Holmes can serve as a "Holmes-test" for
multimodal reasoning, motivating models to reason more like humans and
emphasizing the ongoing challenges in this field. The benchmark is released in

Abstract: Active vision, also known as active perception, refers to the process of
actively selecting where and how to look in order to gather task-relevant
information. It is a critical component of efficient perception and
decision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and
decision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention.
However, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence,
there is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn
active perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic
definition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the
recently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a
special case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search
efficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose
ACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on
top of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We
further establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across
both general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding,
and domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote
sensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive
segmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot
reasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit
reasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and
evaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in
MLLMs.

Result: PH-Reg能有效减少异常令牌数量，提升模型在零样本和线性探测任务中的分割和深度预测性能。

Conclusion: PH-Reg是一种高效的方法，能够在不重新训练的情况下改进预训练ViT模型的性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual processing tasks, demonstrating excellent scalability with increased
training data and model size. However, recent work has identified the emergence
of artifact tokens in ViTs that are incongruous with the local semantics. These
anomalous tokens degrade ViT performance in tasks that require fine-grained
localization or structural coherence. An effective mitigation of this issue is
to the addition of register tokens to ViTs, which implicitly "absorb" the
artifact term during training. Given the availability of various large-scale
pre-trained ViTs, in this paper we aim at equipping them with such register
tokens without the need of re-training them from scratch, which is infeasible
considering their size. Specifically, we propose Post Hoc Registers (PH-Reg),
an efficient self-distillation method that integrates registers into an
existing ViT without requiring additional labeled data and full retraining.
PH-Reg initializes both teacher and student networks from the same pre-trained
ViT. The teacher remains frozen and unmodified, while the student is augmented
with randomly initialized register tokens. By applying test-time augmentation
to the teacher's inputs, we generate denoised dense embeddings free of
artifacts, which are then used to optimize only a small subset of unlocked
student weights. We show that our approach can effectively reduce the number of
artifact tokens, improving the segmentation and depth prediction of the student
ViT under zero-shot and linear probing.

relevance to the given modification request. DICE consists of two key
components: a difference detector and a coherence estimator, both built on an
autoregressive Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and trained using a
strategy that leverages self-supervision, distillation from inpainting
networks, and full supervision. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate each
stage of our pipeline, comparing different MLLMs within the proposed framework.
We demonstrate that DICE effectively identifies coherent edits, effectively
evaluating images generated by different editing models with a strong
correlation with human judgment. We publicly release our source code, models,
and data.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained prominence as a computationally
efficient method for fine-tuning generative models, enabling distinct visual
concept synthesis with minimal overhead. However, current methods struggle to
effectively merge multiple LoRA adapters without training, particularly in
complex compositions involving diverse visual elements. We introduce MultLFG, a
novel framework for training-free multi-LoRA composition that utilizes
frequency-domain guidance to achieve adaptive fusion of multiple LoRAs. Unlike
existing methods that uniformly aggregate concept-specific LoRAs, MultLFG
employs a timestep and frequency subband adaptive fusion strategy, selectively
activating relevant LoRAs based on content relevance at specific timesteps and
frequency bands. This frequency-sensitive guidance not only improves spatial
coherence but also provides finer control over multi-LoRA composition, leading
to more accurate and consistent results. Experimental evaluations on the
ComposLoRA benchmark reveal that MultLFG substantially enhances compositional
fidelity and image quality across various styles and concept sets,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in multi-concept generation tasks.
Code will be released.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve
remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck,

data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation
instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To
this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100
multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found
in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in
zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing
for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like

understanding by introducing timestamp-aware multi-segment grounding. MUSEG
enables MLLMs to align queries with multiple relevant video segments, promoting
more comprehensive temporal reasoning. To facilitate effective learning, we

guides the model toward temporally grounded reasoning. Extensive experiments on

Method: MetaSlot通过维护对象原型代码库、去除重复槽和注入渐进噪声来优化Slot Attention。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中，MetaSlot显著提升了性能并生成更可解释的槽表示。

Conclusion: MetaSlot是一种通用且高效的Slot Attention改进方法，适用于现有对象中心学习架构。

Abstract: Learning object-level, structured representations is widely regarded as a key
to better generalization in vision and underpins the design of next-generation
Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs). Mainstream Object-Centric Learning (OCL)
methods adopt Slot Attention or its variants to iteratively aggregate objects'
super-pixels into a fixed set of query feature vectors, termed slots. However,
their reliance on a static slot count leads to an object being represented as
multiple parts when the number of objects varies. We introduce MetaSlot, a
plug-and-play Slot Attention variant that adapts to variable object counts.
MetaSlot (i) maintains a codebook that holds prototypes of objects in a dataset
by vector-quantizing the resulting slot representations; (ii) removes duplicate
slots from the traditionally aggregated slots by quantizing them with the
codebook; and (iii) injects progressively weaker noise into the Slot Attention
iterations to accelerate and stabilize the aggregation. MetaSlot is a general
Slot Attention variant that can be seamlessly integrated into existing OCL
architectures. Across multiple public datasets and tasks--including object
discovery and recognition--models equipped with MetaSlot achieve significant
performance gains and markedly interpretable slot representations, compared
with existing Slot Attention variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLM）在SVG生成中因缺乏训练时的渲染观察而难以生成高效且准确的SVG。

Method: 使用强化学习（RL）方法RLRF，通过比较渲染的SVG输出与原始图像生成奖励信号，优化模型生成效果。

Result: RLRF显著优于监督微调，能生成更准确、高效且语义一致的SVG。

Conclusion: RLRF通过渲染反馈有效解决了SVG生成中的常见问题，提升了生成质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) offer a powerful format for representing
visual designs as interpretable code. Recent advances in vision-language models
(VLMs) have enabled high-quality SVG generation by framing the problem as a
code generation task and leveraging large-scale pretraining. VLMs are
particularly suitable for this task as they capture both global semantics and
fine-grained visual patterns, while transferring knowledge across vision,
natural language, and code domains. However, existing VLM approaches often
struggle to produce faithful and efficient SVGs because they never observe the
rendered images during training. Although differentiable rendering for
autoregressive SVG code generation remains unavailable, rendered outputs can
still be compared to original inputs, enabling evaluative feedback suitable for
reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce RLRF(Reinforcement Learning from
Rendering Feedback), an RL method that enhances SVG generation in
autoregressive VLMs by leveraging feedback from rendered SVG outputs. Given an
input image, the model generates SVG roll-outs that are rendered and compared
to the original image to compute a reward. This visual fidelity feedback guides
the model toward producing more accurate, efficient, and semantically coherent
SVGs. RLRF significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning, addressing common
failure modes and enabling precise, high-quality SVG generation with strong
structural understanding and generalization.

Motivation: 当前自回归扩散模型在生成长视频时存在误差累积问题，且难以处理多场景切换。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出帧级标注和帧级注意力机制，结合Diffusion Forcing训练方法，实现文本与视频的精确匹配。

Result: 在VBench 2.0基准测试中表现优异，能更好地处理复杂、多变的场景。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了长视频生成的质量和多场景处理能力，计划公开数据集和模型。

Abstract: Generating long videos that can show complex stories, like movie scenes from
scripts, has great promise and offers much more than short clips. However,
current methods that use autoregression with diffusion models often struggle
because their step-by-step process naturally leads to a serious error
accumulation (drift). Also, many existing ways to make long videos focus on
single, continuous scenes, making them less useful for stories with many events
and changes. This paper introduces a new approach to solve these problems.
First, we propose a novel way to annotate datasets at the frame-level,
providing detailed text guidance needed for making complex, multi-scene long
videos. This detailed guidance works with a Frame-Level Attention Mechanism to
make sure text and video match precisely. A key feature is that each part
(frame) within these windows can be guided by its own distinct text prompt. Our
training uses Diffusion Forcing to provide the model with the ability to handle
time flexibly. We tested our approach on difficult VBench 2.0 benchmarks
("Complex Plots" and "Complex Landscapes") based on the WanX2.1-T2V-1.3B model.
The results show our method is better at following instructions in complex,
changing scenes and creates high-quality long videos. We plan to share our
dataset annotation methods and trained models with the research community.

Abstract: Video generation using diffusion models is highly computationally intensive,
with 3D attention in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models accounting for over
80\% of the total computational resources. In this work, we introduce {\bf
RainFusion}, a novel training-free sparse attention method that exploits
inherent sparsity nature in visual data to accelerate attention computation
while preserving video quality. Specifically, we identify three unique sparse
patterns in video generation attention calculations--Spatial Pattern, Temporal
Pattern and Textural Pattern. The sparse pattern for each attention head is
determined online with negligible overhead (\textasciitilde\,0.2\%) with our
proposed {\bf ARM} (Adaptive Recognition Module) during inference. Our proposed
{\bf RainFusion} is a plug-and-play method, that can be seamlessly integrated
into state-of-the-art 3D-attention video generation models without additional

including HunyuanVideo, OpenSoraPlan-1.2 and CogVideoX-5B, demonstrating its
broad applicability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that
RainFusion achieves over {\bf 2\(\times\)} speedup in attention computation
while maintaining video quality, with only a minimal impact on VBench scores

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made great achievements in Earth
vision. However, complex disaster scenes with diverse disaster types,
geographic regions, and satellite sensors have posed new challenges for VLM
applications. To fill this gap, we curate a remote sensing vision-language
dataset (DisasterM3) for global-scale disaster assessment and response.
DisasterM3 includes 26,988 bi-temporal satellite images and 123k instruction
pairs across 5 continents, with three characteristics: 1) Multi-hazard:
DisasterM3 involves 36 historical disaster events with significant impacts,
which are categorized into 10 common natural and man-made disasters.
2)Multi-sensor: Extreme weather during disasters often hinders optical sensor
imaging, making it necessary to combine Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery
for post-disaster scenes. 3) Multi-task: Based on real-world scenarios,
DisasterM3 includes 9 disaster-related visual perception and reasoning tasks,
harnessing the full potential of VLM's reasoning ability with progressing from
disaster-bearing body recognition to structural damage assessment and object
relational reasoning, culminating in the generation of long-form disaster
reports. We extensively evaluated 14 generic and remote sensing VLMs on our
benchmark, revealing that state-of-the-art models struggle with the disaster
tasks, largely due to the lack of a disaster-specific corpus, cross-sensor gap,
and damage object counting insensitivity. Focusing on these issues, we
fine-tune four VLMs using our dataset and achieve stable improvements across
all tasks, with robust cross-sensor and cross-disaster generalization
capabilities.

Motivation: 扩散模型中的负向引导在少步采样情况下表现不佳，现有方法如Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)在极端采样步数下失效。

Result: 实验表明，NAG在文本对齐、保真度和人类感知质量上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: NAG是一种模型无关的推理时方法，无需重新训练即可应用于现代扩散框架。

Abstract: Negative guidance -- explicitly suppressing unwanted attributes -- remains a
fundamental challenge in diffusion models, particularly in few-step sampling
regimes. While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) works well in standard settings,
it fails under aggressive sampling step compression due to divergent
predictions between positive and negative branches. We present Normalized
Attention Guidance (NAG), an efficient, training-free mechanism that applies
extrapolation in attention space with L1-based normalization and refinement.
NAG restores effective negative guidance where CFG collapses while maintaining
fidelity. Unlike existing approaches, NAG generalizes across architectures
(UNet, DiT), sampling regimes (few-step, multi-step), and modalities (image,
video), functioning as a \textit{universal} plug-in with minimal computational
overhead. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate consistent
improvements in text alignment (CLIP Score), fidelity (FID, PFID), and
human-perceived quality (ImageReward). Our ablation studies validate each
design component, while user studies confirm significant preference for
NAG-guided outputs. As a model-agnostic inference-time approach requiring no
retraining, NAG provides effortless negative guidance for all modern diffusion
frameworks -- pseudocode in the Appendix!

Motivation: 当前基于VLM的VQA方法处理整个图像，导致大量冗余视觉令牌，增加了内存和计算需求。

Method: CROP通过两步实现：1) 定位输入查询相关的上下文区域；2) 采用两种剪枝策略（PLC和ILP）压缩令牌。

Result: CROP在多种VQA任务中显著优于现有视觉令牌剪枝方法，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: CROP有效减少了冗余视觉令牌，提升了VQA任务的效率和性能。

Abstract: Current VLM-based VQA methods often process entire images, leading to
excessive visual tokens that include redundant information irrelevant to the
posed question. This abundance of unnecessary image details creates numerous
visual tokens, drastically increasing memory and computational requirements in
VLMs. To address this, we propose Contextual Region-Oriented Visual Token
Pruning (CROP), a novel framework to compress visual tokens through a two-step
process: Localization and Pruning. Specifically, CROP first employs an
efficient model to identify the contextual region relevant to the input query.
Subsequently, two distinct strategies are introduced for pruning: (1) Pre-LLM
Compression (PLC), which adaptively compresses different image regions with
varying ratios, and (2) Inner-LLM Pruning (ILP), a training-free method that
prunes tokens within early LLM layers guided by the identified contextual
region. Extensive experiments on a wide range of VQA tasks demonstrate that
CROP significantly outperforms existing visual token pruning methods and
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code and datasets will be made
available.

Result: 最佳模型（Gemini-2.5 Pro）准确率仅73.7%，模型在单帧任务表现良好，但在时空推理任务上能力有限。

Conclusion: 视频OCR需要高分辨率输入和充分的时间覆盖，现有MLLMs需改进时空推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable accuracy
in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from static images. However, their
efficacy in video OCR is significantly diminished due to factors such as motion
blur, temporal variations, and visual effects inherent in video content. To
provide clearer guidance for training practical MLLMs, we introduce the
MME-VideoOCR benchmark, which encompasses a comprehensive range of video OCR
application scenarios. MME-VideoOCR features 10 task categories comprising 25
individual tasks and spans 44 diverse scenarios. These tasks extend beyond text
recognition to incorporate deeper comprehension and reasoning of textual
content within videos. The benchmark consists of 1,464 videos with varying
resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, along with 2,000 meticulously
curated, manually annotated question-answer pairs. We evaluate 18
state-of-the-art MLLMs on MME-VideoOCR, revealing that even the best-performing
model (Gemini-2.5 Pro) achieves an accuracy of only 73.7%. Fine-grained
analysis indicates that while existing MLLMs demonstrate strong performance on
tasks where relevant texts are contained within a single or few frames, they
exhibit limited capability in effectively handling tasks that demand holistic
video comprehension. These limitations are especially evident in scenarios that
require spatio-temporal reasoning, cross-frame information integration, or
resistance to language prior bias. Our findings also highlight the importance
of high-resolution visual input and sufficient temporal coverage for reliable
OCR in dynamic video scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has evolved beyond single monolithic models to
complex multi-component pipelines. These combine fine-tuned generators,
adapters, upscaling blocks and even editing steps, leading to significant
improvements in image quality. However, their effective design requires
substantial expertise. Recent approaches have shown promise in automating this
process through large language models (LLMs), but they suffer from two critical
limitations: extensive computational requirements from generating images with
hundreds of predefined pipelines, and poor generalization beyond memorized
training examples. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based framework
that addresses these inefficiencies. Our approach first trains an ensemble of
reward models capable of predicting image quality scores directly from
prompt-workflow combinations, eliminating the need for costly image generation
during training. We then implement a two-phase training strategy: initial
workflow vocabulary training followed by GRPO-based optimization that guides
the model toward higher-performing regions of the workflow space. Additionally,
we incorporate a classifier-free guidance based enhancement technique that
extrapolates along the path between the initial and GRPO-tuned models, further
improving output quality. We validate our approach through a set of
comparisons, showing that it can successfully create new flows with greater
diversity and lead to superior image quality compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: 噪声对齐策略有效解决了多主题生成中的布局冲突问题，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Generating multiple distinct subjects remains a challenge for existing
text-to-image diffusion models. Complex prompts often lead to subject leakage,
causing inaccuracies in quantities, attributes, and visual features. Preventing
leakage among subjects necessitates knowledge of each subject's spatial
location. Recent methods provide these spatial locations via an external layout
control. However, enforcing such a prescribed layout often conflicts with the
innate layout dictated by the sampled initial noise, leading to misalignment
with the model's prior. In this work, we introduce a new approach that predicts
a spatial layout aligned with the prompt, derived from the initial noise, and
refines it throughout the denoising process. By relying on this noise-induced
layout, we avoid conflicts with externally imposed layouts and better preserve
the model's prior. Our method employs a small neural network to predict and
refine the evolving noise-induced layout at each denoising step, ensuring clear
boundaries between subjects while maintaining consistency. Experimental results
show that this noise-aligned strategy achieves improved text-image alignment
and more stable multi-subject generation compared to existing layout-guided
techniques, while preserving the rich diversity of the model's original
distribution.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
understanding and reasoning about visual content, but significant challenges
persist in tasks requiring cross-viewpoint understanding and spatial reasoning.
We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric
spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to
allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of
reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark
designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition
evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D
annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive
evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant
performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on
camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a
human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset,
we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks,
highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial
benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides
empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs'

Conclusion: 该框架为FER模型的公平性评估提供了可靠工具，并指导选择更公平的网络架构。

Abstract: Recent studies on fairness have shown that Facial Expression Recognition
(FER) models exhibit biases toward certain visually perceived demographic
groups. However, the limited availability of human-annotated demographic labels
in public FER datasets has constrained the scope of such bias analysis. To
overcome this limitation, some prior works have resorted to pseudo-demographic
labels, which may distort bias evaluation results. Alternatively, in this
paper, we propose a feature-level bias evaluation framework for evaluating
demographic biases in FER models under the setting where demographic labels are
unavailable in the test set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
more effectively evaluates demographic biases compared to existing approaches
that rely on pseudo-demographic labels. Furthermore, we observe that many
existing studies do not include statistical testing in their bias evaluations,
raising concerns that some reported biases may not be statistically significant
but rather due to randomness. To address this issue, we introduce a
plug-and-play statistical module to ensure the statistical significance of
biased evaluation results. A comprehensive bias analysis based on the proposed
module is then conducted across three sensitive attributes (age, gender, and
race), seven facial expressions, and multiple network architectures on a
large-scale dataset, revealing the prominent demographic biases in FER and
providing insights on selecting a fairer network architecture.

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上达到SOTA性能，计算效率提升。例如，Human3.6M上MPJPE为37.7mm。

Conclusion: SCT和LPG有效减少了冗余并提升了性能，双流网络进一步优化了建模能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based 3D human pose estimation methods suffer from high
computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention with
respect to sequence length. Additionally, pose sequences often contain
significant redundancy between frames. However, recent methods typically fail
to improve model capacity while effectively eliminating sequence redundancy. In
this work, we introduce the Spectral Compression Transformer (SCT) to reduce
sequence length and accelerate computation. The SCT encoder treats hidden
features between blocks as Temporal Feature Signals (TFS) and applies the
Discrete Cosine Transform, a Fourier transform-based technique, to determine
the spectral components to be retained. By filtering out certain high-frequency
noise components, SCT compresses the sequence length and reduces redundancy. To
further enrich the input sequence with prior structural information, we propose
the Line Pose Graph (LPG) based on line graph theory. The LPG generates
skeletal position information that complements the input 2D joint positions,
thereby improving the model's performance. Finally, we design a dual-stream
network architecture to effectively model spatial joint relationships and the
compressed motion trajectory within the pose sequence. Extensive experiments on
two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved computational
efficiency. For example, on the Human3.6M dataset, our method achieves an MPJPE
of 37.7mm while maintaining a low computational cost. Furthermore, we perform
ablation studies on each module to assess its effectiveness. The code and
models will be released.

Result: 在LLaVA-Next框架下实验，ID-Align在MMBench关系推理任务上提升6.09%，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: ID-Align有效解决了高分辨率与缩略图token交互问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Currently, a prevalent approach for enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
performance is to encode both the high-resolution version and the thumbnail of
an image simultaneously. While effective, this method generates a large number
of image tokens. When combined with the widely used Rotary Position Embedding
(RoPE), its long-term decay property hinders the interaction between
high-resolution tokens and thumbnail tokens, as well as between text and image.
To address these issues, we propose ID-Align, which alleviates these problems
by reordering position IDs. In this method, high-resolution tokens inherit IDs
from their corresponding thumbnail token while constraining the overexpansion
of positional indices. Our experiments conducted within the LLaVA-Next

Motivation: 现有RMOT任务在复杂推理语言指令下表现不佳，需提升模型推理能力。

Result: ReaTrack在ReaMOT Challenge上表现有效。

Conclusion: ReaMOT任务和ReaTrack框架为推理多目标跟踪提供了新方向。

Abstract: Referring Multi-object tracking (RMOT) is an important research field in
computer vision. Its task form is to guide the models to track the objects that
conform to the language instruction. However, the RMOT task commonly requires
clear language instructions, such methods often fail to work when complex
language instructions with reasoning characteristics appear. In this work, we
propose a new task, called Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking (ReaMOT).
ReaMOT is a more challenging task that requires accurate reasoning about
objects that match the language instruction with reasoning characteristic and
tracking the objects' trajectories. To advance the ReaMOT task and evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of tracking models, we construct ReaMOT Challenge, a
reasoning-based multi-object tracking benchmark built upon 12 datasets.
Specifically, it comprises 1,156 language instructions with reasoning
characteristic, 423,359 image-language pairs, and 869 diverse scenes, which is
divided into three levels of reasoning difficulty. In addition, we propose a
set of evaluation metrics tailored for the ReaMOT task. Furthermore, we propose
ReaTrack, a training-free framework for reasoning-based multi-object tracking
based on large vision-language models (LVLM) and SAM2, as a baseline for the
ReaMOT task. Extensive experiments on the ReaMOT Challenge benchmark
demonstrate the effectiveness of our ReaTrack framework.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能提升运动预测性能，还能通过轨迹修改实现目标导向的指令执行和场景适应性调整。

Abstract: Motion forecasts of road users (i.e., agents) vary in complexity as a
function of scene constraints and interactive behavior. We address this with a
multi-task learning method for motion forecasting that includes a retrocausal
flow of information. The corresponding tasks are to forecast (1) marginal
trajectory distributions for all modeled agents and (2) joint trajectory
distributions for interacting agents. Using a transformer model, we generate
the joint distributions by re-encoding marginal distributions followed by
pairwise modeling. This incorporates a retrocausal flow of information from
later points in marginal trajectories to earlier points in joint trajectories.
Per trajectory point, we model positional uncertainty using compressed
exponential power distributions. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art
results in the Waymo Interaction Prediction dataset and generalizes well to the
Argoverse 2 dataset. Additionally, our method provides an interface for issuing
instructions through trajectory modifications. Our experiments show that
regular training of motion forecasting leads to the ability to follow
goal-based instructions and to adapt basic directional instructions to the
scene context. Code: https://github.com/kit-mrt/future-motion

Conclusion: CCL-LGS通过多视角语义一致性监督有效解决了跨视角语义冲突，提升了3D语义场的质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction techniques and vision-language models
have fueled significant progress in 3D semantic understanding, a capability
critical to robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual/augmented reality.
However, methods that rely on 2D priors are prone to a critical challenge:
cross-view semantic inconsistencies induced by occlusion, image blur, and
view-dependent variations. These inconsistencies, when propagated via
projection supervision, deteriorate the quality of 3D Gaussian semantic fields
and introduce artifacts in the rendered outputs. To mitigate this limitation,
we propose CCL-LGS, a novel framework that enforces view-consistent semantic
supervision by integrating multi-view semantic cues. Specifically, our approach
first employs a zero-shot tracker to align a set of SAM-generated 2D masks and
reliably identify their corresponding categories. Next, we utilize CLIP to
extract robust semantic encodings across views. Finally, our Contrastive
Codebook Learning (CCL) module distills discriminative semantic features by
enforcing intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness. In contrast
to previous methods that directly apply CLIP to imperfect masks, our framework
explicitly resolves semantic conflicts while preserving category
discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCL-LGS outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods. Our project page is available at

Result: CPathAgent在三个尺度的基准测试中均优于现有方法，生成了更详细和可解释的诊断报告。

Conclusion: CPathAgent为计算病理学的未来发展提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology have led to the emergence of
numerous foundation models. However, these approaches fail to replicate the
diagnostic process of pathologists, as they either simply rely on
general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for classification or
directly apply multimodal models to generate reports from images. A significant
limitation is their inability to emulate the diagnostic logic employed by
pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification for
overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate
comprehensive diagnoses. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an
innovative agent-based model that mimics pathologists' reasoning processes by
autonomously executing zoom-in/out and navigation operations across pathology
images based on observed visual features. To achieve this, we develop a
multi-stage training strategy unifying patch-level, region-level, and
whole-slide capabilities within a single model, which is essential for
mimicking pathologists, who require understanding and reasoning capabilities
across all three scales. This approach generates substantially more detailed
and interpretable diagnostic reports compared to existing methods, particularly
for huge region understanding. Additionally, we construct an expert-validated
PathMMU-HR$^{2}$, the first benchmark for huge region analysis, a critical
intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, as diagnosticians
typically examine several key regions rather than entire slides at once.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms
existing approaches across three scales of benchmarks, validating the
effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a
promising direction for the future development of computational pathology.

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限场景下的个性化手写文本识别提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in handwritten text recognition (HTR) have enabled the
effective conversion of handwritten text to digital formats. However, achieving
robust recognition across diverse writing styles remains challenging.
Traditional HTR methods lack writer-specific personalization at test time due
to limitations in model architecture and training strategies. Existing attempts
to bridge this gap, through gradient-based meta-learning, still require labeled
examples and suffer from parameter-inefficient fine-tuning, leading to
substantial computational and memory overhead. To overcome these challenges, we
propose an efficient framework that formulates personalization as prompt
tuning, incorporating an auxiliary image reconstruction task with a
self-supervised loss to guide prompt adaptation with unlabeled test-time
examples. To ensure self-supervised loss effectively minimizes text recognition
error, we leverage meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization of the
prompts. As a result, our method allows the model to efficiently capture unique
writing styles by updating less than 1% of its parameters and eliminating the
need for time-intensive annotation processes. We validate our approach on the
RIMES and IAM Handwriting Database benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods while using 20x fewer parameters.
We believe this represents a significant advancement in personalized
handwritten text recognition, paving the way for more reliable and practical
deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) remains brittle in real-world

traditional correlation-based approaches in video-based Re-ID. We provide a

identity-specific features from confounding factors. The survey is organized
around a novel taxonomy of causal Re-ID methods that spans generative
disentanglement, domain-invariant modeling, and causal transformers. We review
current evaluation metrics and introduce causal-specific robustness measures.
In addition, we assess practical challenges of scalability, fairness,
interpretability, and privacy that must be addressed for real-world adoption.
Finally, we identify open problems and outline future research directions that
integrate causal modeling with efficient architectures and self-supervised
learning. This survey aims to establish a coherent foundation for causal
video-based person Re-ID and to catalyze the next phase of research in this
rapidly evolving domain.

Conclusion: OccLE在减少标注成本的同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an intuitive and efficient scene
understanding and has attracted significant interest in autonomous driving
perception. Existing approaches either rely on full supervision, which demands
costly voxel-level annotations, or on self-supervision, which provides limited
guidance and yields suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we
propose OccLE, a Label-Efficient 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction that takes
images and LiDAR as inputs and maintains high performance with limited voxel
annotations. Our intuition is to decouple the semantic and geometric learning
tasks and then fuse the learned feature grids from both tasks for the final
semantic occupancy prediction. Therefore, the semantic branch distills 2D
foundation model to provide aligned pseudo labels for 2D and 3D semantic
learning. The geometric branch integrates image and LiDAR inputs in cross-plane
synergy based on their inherency, employing semi-supervision to enhance
geometry learning. We fuse semantic-geometric feature grids through Dual Mamba
and incorporate a scatter-accumulated projection to supervise unannotated
prediction with aligned pseudo labels. Experiments show that OccLE achieves
competitive performance with only 10% of voxel annotations, reaching a mIoU of
16.59% on the SemanticKITTI validation set.

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练即可实现风格对齐和主题一致性，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: In text-to-image models, consistent character generation is the task of
achieving text alignment while maintaining the subject's appearance across
different prompts. However, since style and appearance are often entangled, the
existing methods struggle to preserve consistent subject characteristics while
adhering to varying style prompts. Current approaches for consistent
text-to-image generation typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning on curated
image sets or per-subject optimization, which either fail to generalize across
prompts or do not align well with textual descriptions. Meanwhile,
training-free methods often fail to maintain subject consistency across
different styles. In this work, we introduce a training-free method that
achieves both style alignment and subject consistency. The attention matrices
are manipulated such that Queries and Keys are obtained from the anchor
image(s) that are used to define the subject, while the Values are imported
from a parallel copy that is not subject-anchored. Additionally, cross-image
components are added to the self-attention mechanism by expanding the Key and
Value matrices. To do without shifting from the target style, we align the
statistics of the Value matrices. As is demonstrated in a comprehensive battery
of qualitative and quantitative experiments, our method effectively decouples
style from subject appearance and enables faithful generation of text-aligned
images with consistent characters across diverse styles.

Conclusion: FlexTI2V为TI2V生成提供了一种灵活且高效的方法，平衡了创造性和保真度。

Abstract: Text-image-to-video (TI2V) generation is a critical problem for controllable
video generation using both semantic and visual conditions. Most existing
methods typically add visual conditions to text-to-video (T2V) foundation
models by finetuning, which is costly in resources and only limited to a few
predefined conditioning settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce a unified
formulation for TI2V generation with flexible visual conditioning. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative training-free approach, dubbed FlexTI2V, that can
condition T2V foundation models on an arbitrary amount of images at arbitrary
positions. Specifically, we firstly invert the condition images to noisy
representation in a latent space. Then, in the denoising process of T2V models,
our method uses a novel random patch swapping strategy to incorporate visual
features into video representations through local image patches. To balance
creativity and fidelity, we use a dynamic control mechanism to adjust the
strength of visual conditioning to each video frame. Extensive experiments
validate that our method surpasses previous training-free image conditioning
methods by a notable margin. We also show more insights of our method by
detailed ablation study and analysis.

Abstract: Open-Ended object Detection (OED) is a novel and challenging task that
detects objects and generates their category names in a free-form manner,
without requiring additional vocabularies during inference. However, the
existing OED models, such as GenerateU, require large-scale datasets for
training, suffer from slow convergence, and exhibit limited performance. To
address these issues, we present a novel and efficient Open-Det framework,
consisting of four collaborative parts. Specifically, Open-Det accelerates
model training in both the bounding box and object name generation process by
reconstructing the Object Detector and the Object Name Generator. To bridge the
semantic gap between Vision and Language modalities, we propose a
Vision-Language Aligner with V-to-L and L-to-V alignment mechanisms,
incorporating with the Prompts Distiller to transfer knowledge from the VLM
into VL-prompts, enabling accurate object name generation for the LLM. In
addition, we design a Masked Alignment Loss to eliminate contradictory
supervision and introduce a Joint Loss to enhance classification, resulting in
more efficient training. Compared to GenerateU, Open-Det, using only 1.5% of
the training data (0.077M vs. 5.077M), 20.8% of the training epochs (31 vs.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires real-time, robust reasoning across perception,
prediction, planning, and behavior. However, conventional end-to-end models
fail to generalize in complex scenarios due to the lack of structured
reasoning. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have been applied to driving
tasks, but they typically rely on isolated modules and static supervision,
limiting their ability to support multi-stage decision-making. We present
AutoDriveRL, a unified training framework that formulates autonomous driving as
a structured reasoning process over four core tasks. Each task is independently
modeled as a vision-language question-answering problem and optimized using
task-specific reward models, enabling fine-grained reinforcement signals at
different reasoning stages. Within this framework, we train DriveRX, a
cross-task reasoning VLM designed for real-time decision-making. DriveRX
achieves strong performance on a public benchmark, outperforming GPT-4o in
behavior reasoning and demonstrating robustness under complex or corrupted
driving conditions. Our analysis further highlights the impact of vision
encoder design and reward-guided reasoning compression. We will release the
AutoDriveRL framework and the DriveRX model to support future research.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for dataset
compression, enabling the synthesis of compact surrogate datasets that
approximate the training utility of large-scale ones. While significant
progress has been achieved in distilling image datasets, extending DD to the
video domain remains challenging due to the high dimensionality and temporal
complexity inherent in video data. Existing video distillation (VD) methods
often suffer from excessive computational costs and struggle to preserve
temporal dynamics, as na\"ive extensions of image-based approaches typically
lead to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a novel uni-level video
dataset distillation framework that directly optimizes synthetic videos with
respect to a pre-trained model. To address temporal redundancy and enhance
motion preservation, we introduce a temporal saliency-guided filtering
mechanism that leverages inter-frame differences to guide the distillation
process, encouraging the retention of informative temporal cues while
suppressing frame-level redundancy. Extensive experiments on standard video
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
bridging the gap between real and distilled video data and offering a scalable
solution for video dataset compression.

Abstract: Wild Test-Time Adaptation (WTTA) is proposed to adapt a source model to
unseen domains under extreme data scarcity and multiple shifts. Previous
approaches mainly focused on sample selection strategies, while overlooking the
fundamental problem on underlying optimization. Initially, we critically
analyze the widely-adopted entropy minimization framework in WTTA and uncover
its significant limitations in noisy optimization dynamics that substantially
hinder adaptation efficiency. Through our analysis, we identify region
confidence as a superior alternative to traditional entropy, however, its
direct optimization remains computationally prohibitive for real-time
applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel region-integrated method
ReCAP that bypasses the lengthy process. Specifically, we propose a
probabilistic region modeling scheme that flexibly captures semantic changes in
embedding space. Subsequently, we develop a finite-to-infinite asymptotic
approximation that transforms the intractable region confidence into a
tractable and upper-bounded proxy. These innovations significantly unlock the
overlooked potential dynamics in local region in a concise solution. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of ReCAP over
existing methods across various datasets and wild scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a novel self-improving framework that enhances Embodied Visual

current active visual tracking systems in recovering from tracking failure. Our
approach combines the off-the-shelf active tracking methods with VLMs'

activating VLM reasoning only upon failure detection. The framework features a
memory-augmented self-reflection mechanism that enables the VLM to
progressively improve by learning from past experiences, effectively addressing
VLMs' limitations in 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate
significant performance improvements, with our framework boosting success rates
by $72\%$ with state-of-the-art RL-based approaches and $220\%$ with PID-based
methods in challenging environments. This work represents the first integration
of VLM-based reasoning to assist EVT agents in proactive failure recovery,
offering substantial advances for real-world robotic applications that require

Motivation: 扩散模型（DMs）因其迭代性质导致生成效率低下，而FM作为一种替代方法，其基于高斯先验的路径对ODE求解器提出了挑战。LeDiFlow旨在通过改进先验分布解决这一问题。

Method: LeDiFlow通过辅助回归模型学习更适合的先验分布，初始化ODE求解器，从而减少推理步骤。结合SOTA Transformer架构和潜在空间采样，可在消费级工作站上训练。

Result: LeDiFlow在像素空间推理速度提升3.75倍，潜在空间模型在CMMD指标上图像质量提升1.32倍。

Conclusion: LeDiFlow通过优化先验分布，显著提升了FM模型的效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Enhancing the efficiency of high-quality image generation using Diffusion
Models (DMs) is a significant challenge due to the iterative nature of the
process. Flow Matching (FM) is emerging as a powerful generative modeling
paradigm based on a simulation-free training objective instead of a score-based
one used in DMs. Typical FM approaches rely on a Gaussian distribution prior,
which induces curved, conditional probability paths between the prior and
target data distribution. These curved paths pose a challenge for the Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE) solver, requiring a large number of inference calls
to the flow prediction network. To address this issue, we present Learned
Distribution-guided Flow Matching (LeDiFlow), a novel scalable method for
training FM-based image generation models using a better-suited prior
distribution learned via a regression-based auxiliary model. By initializing
the ODE solver with a prior closer to the target data distribution, LeDiFlow
enables the learning of more computationally tractable probability paths. These
paths directly translate to fewer solver steps needed for high-quality image
generation at inference time. Our method utilizes a State-Of-The-Art (SOTA)
transformer architecture combined with latent space sampling and can be trained
on a consumer workstation. We empirically demonstrate that LeDiFlow remarkably
outperforms the respective FM baselines. For instance, when operating directly
on pixels, our model accelerates inference by up to 3.75x compared to the
corresponding pixel-space baseline. Simultaneously, our latent FM model
enhances image quality on average by 1.32x in CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) metric against its respective baseline.

Conclusion: Intern-GS通过结合视觉基础模型，显著提升了稀疏视图场景重建的质量。

Abstract: Sparse-view scene reconstruction often faces significant challenges due to
the constraints imposed by limited observational data. These limitations result
in incomplete information, leading to suboptimal reconstructions using existing
methodologies. To address this, we present Intern-GS, a novel approach that
effectively leverages rich prior knowledge from vision foundation models to
enhance the process of sparse-view Gaussian Splatting, thereby enabling
high-quality scene reconstruction. Specifically, Intern-GS utilizes vision
foundation models to guide both the initialization and the optimization process
of 3D Gaussian splatting, effectively addressing the limitations of sparse
inputs. In the initialization process, our method employs DUSt3R to generate a
dense and non-redundant gaussian point cloud. This approach significantly
alleviates the limitations encountered by traditional structure-from-motion
(SfM) methods, which often struggle under sparse-view constraints. During the
optimization process, vision foundation models predict depth and appearance for
unobserved views, refining the 3D Gaussians to compensate for missing
information in unseen regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Intern-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality across diverse datasets, including
both forward-facing and large-scale scenes, such as LLFF, DTU, and Tanks and
Temples.

Conclusion: MVTN为3D理解提供新方法，并开源了MVTorch库。

Abstract: Multi-view projection techniques have shown themselves to be highly effective
in achieving top-performing results in the recognition of 3D shapes. These
methods involve learning how to combine information from multiple view-points.
However, the camera view-points from which these views are obtained are often
fixed for all shapes. To overcome the static nature of current multi-view
techniques, we propose learning these view-points. Specifically, we introduce
the Multi-View Transformation Network (MVTN), which uses differentiable
rendering to determine optimal view-points for 3D shape recognition. As a
result, MVTN can be trained end-to-end with any multi-view network for 3D shape
classification. We integrate MVTN into a novel adaptive multi-view pipeline
that is capable of rendering both 3D meshes and point clouds. Our approach
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in 3D classification and shape
retrieval on several benchmarks (ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, ShapeNet Core55).
Further analysis indicates that our approach exhibits improved robustness to
occlusion compared to other methods. We also investigate additional aspects of
MVTN, such as 2D pretraining and its use for segmentation. To support further
research in this area, we have released MVTorch, a PyTorch library for 3D
understanding and generation using multi-view projections.

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image
specified by a query image and a relative text that describes a semantic
modification to the query image. Existing methods in CIR struggle to accurately
represent the image and the text modification, resulting in subpar performance.
To address this limitation, we introduce a CIR framework, ConText-CIR, trained
with a Text Concept-Consistency loss that encourages the representations of
noun phrases in the text modification to better attend to the relevant parts of
the query image. To support training with this loss function, we also propose a
synthetic data generation pipeline that creates training data from existing CIR
datasets or unlabeled images. We show that these components together enable
stronger performance on CIR tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art in composed
image retrieval in both the supervised and zero-shot settings on multiple
benchmark datasets, including CIRR and CIRCO. Source code, model checkpoints,
and our new datasets are available at https://github.com/mvrl/ConText-CIR.

Conclusion: CD-MTA通过去除对类别语义的依赖，实现了对未见类别的泛化，且无需训练数据。

Abstract: We present Cross-Domain Multi-Targeted Attack (CD-MTA), a method for
generating adversarial examples that mislead image classifiers toward any
target class, including those not seen during training. Traditional targeted
attacks are limited to one class per model, requiring expensive retraining for
each target. Multi-targeted attacks address this by introducing a perturbation
generator with a conditional input to specify the target class. However,
existing methods are constrained to classes observed during training and
require access to the black-box model's training data--introducing a form of
data leakage that undermines realistic evaluation in practical black-box
scenarios. We identify overreliance on class embeddings as a key limitation,
leading to overfitting and poor generalization to unseen classes. To address
this, CD-MTA replaces class-level supervision with an image-based conditional
input and introduces class-agnostic losses that align the perturbed and target
images in the feature space. This design removes dependence on class semantics,
thereby enabling generalization to unseen classes across datasets. Experiments
on ImageNet and seven other datasets show that CD-MTA outperforms prior
multi-targeted attacks in both standard and cross-domain settings--without
accessing the black-box model's training data.

Result: 在多种图像数据集上验证，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DMILO和DMILO-PGD有效解决了扩散模型在逆问题求解中的常见挑战。

Abstract: Inverse problems (IPs) involve reconstructing signals from noisy
observations. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted priors, which
can fail to capture the complexity of real-world data. The advent of
pre-trained generative models has introduced new paradigms, offering improved
reconstructions by learning rich priors from data. Among these, diffusion
models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful framework, achieving remarkable
reconstruction performance across numerous IPs. However, existing DM-based
methods frequently encounter issues such as heavy computational demands and
suboptimal convergence. In this work, building upon the idea of the recent work
DMPlug~\cite{wang2024dmplug}, we propose two novel methods, DMILO and
DMILO-PGD, to address these challenges. Our first method, DMILO, employs
intermediate layer optimization (ILO) to alleviate the memory burden inherent
in DMPlug. Additionally, by introducing sparse deviations, we expand the range
of DMs, enabling the exploration of underlying signals that may lie outside the
range of the diffusion model. We further propose DMILO-PGD, which integrates
ILO with projected gradient descent (PGD), thereby reducing the risk of
suboptimal convergence. We provide an intuitive theoretical analysis of our
approach under appropriate conditions and validate its superiority through
extensive experiments on diverse image datasets, encompassing both linear and
nonlinear IPs. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of DMILO and DMILO-PGD
in addressing common challenges in DM-based IP solvers.

Conclusion: RAP通过因果路径和动态提示切换有效提升扩散模型生成稀有概念的能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in high-fidelity image
generation but often falter when synthesizing rare concepts, i.e., prompts that
are infrequently observed in the training distribution. In this paper, we
introduce RAP, a principled framework that treats rare concept generation as
navigating a latent causal path: a progressive, model-aligned trajectory
through the generative space from frequent concepts to rare targets. Rather
than relying on heuristic prompt alternation, we theoretically justify that
rare prompt guidance can be approximated by semantically related frequent
prompts. We then formulate prompt switching as a dynamic process based on score
similarity, enabling adaptive stage transitions. Furthermore, we reinterpret
prompt alternation as a second-order denoising mechanism, promoting smooth
semantic progression and coherent visual synthesis. Through this causal lens,
we align input scheduling with the model's internal generative dynamics.
Experiments across diverse diffusion backbones demonstrate that RAP
consistently enhances rare concept generation, outperforming strong baselines
in both automated evaluations and human studies.

Conclusion: CoDA为资源受限环境下的域适应提供了一种高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern on-device neural network applications must operate under resource
constraints while adapting to unpredictable domain shifts. However, this
combined challenge-model compression and domain adaptation-remains largely
unaddressed, as prior work has tackled each issue in isolation: compressed
networks prioritize efficiency within a fixed domain, whereas large, capable
models focus on handling domain shifts. In this work, we propose CoDA, a
frequency composition-based framework that unifies compression and domain
adaptation. During training, CoDA employs quantization-aware training (QAT)
with low-frequency components, enabling a compressed model to selectively learn
robust, generalizable features. At test time, it refines the compact model in a
source-free manner (i.e., test-time adaptation, TTA), leveraging the
full-frequency information from incoming data to adapt to target domains while
treating high-frequency components as domain-specific cues. LFC are aligned
with the trained distribution, while HFC unique to the target distribution are
solely utilized for batch normalization. CoDA can be integrated synergistically
into existing QAT and TTA methods. CoDA is evaluated on widely used
domain-shift benchmarks, including CIFAR10-C and ImageNet-C, across various
model architectures. With significant compression, it achieves accuracy
improvements of 7.96%p on CIFAR10-C and 5.37%p on ImageNet-C over the
full-precision TTA baseline.

Conclusion: DGAD框架在几何编辑和外观保留方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: General object composition (GOC) aims to seamlessly integrate a target object
into a background scene with desired geometric properties, while simultaneously
preserving its fine-grained appearance details. Recent approaches derive
semantic embeddings and integrate them into advanced diffusion models to enable
geometry-editable generation. However, these highly compact embeddings encode
only high-level semantic cues and inevitably discard fine-grained appearance
details. We introduce a Disentangled Geometry-editable and
Appearance-preserving Diffusion (DGAD) model that first leverages semantic
embeddings to implicitly capture the desired geometric transformations and then
employs a cross-attention retrieval mechanism to align fine-grained appearance
features with the geometry-edited representation, facilitating both precise
geometry editing and faithful appearance preservation in object composition.
Specifically, DGAD builds on CLIP/DINO-derived and reference networks to
extract semantic embeddings and appearance-preserving representations, which
are then seamlessly integrated into the encoding and decoding pipelines in a
disentangled manner. We first integrate the semantic embeddings into
pre-trained diffusion models that exhibit strong spatial reasoning capabilities
to implicitly capture object geometry, thereby facilitating flexible object
manipulation and ensuring effective editability. Then, we design a dense
cross-attention mechanism that leverages the implicitly learned object geometry
to retrieve and spatially align appearance features with their corresponding
regions, ensuring faithful appearance consistency. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DGAD framework.

Conclusion: QwT-v2是一种高效且兼容性强的网络量化改进方法。

Abstract: Network quantization is arguably one of the most practical network
compression approaches for reducing the enormous resource consumption of modern
deep neural networks. They usually require diverse and subtle design choices
for specific architecture and tasks. Instead, the QwT method is a simple and
general approach which introduces lightweight additional structures to improve
quantization. But QwT incurs extra parameters and latency. More importantly,
QwT is not compatible with many hardware platforms. In this paper, we propose
QwT-v2, which not only enjoys all advantages of but also resolves major defects
of QwT. By adopting a very lightweight channel-wise affine compensation (CWAC)
module, QwT-v2 introduces significantly less extra parameters and computations
compared to QwT, and at the same time matches or even outperforms QwT in
accuracy. The compensation module of QwT-v2 can be integrated into quantization
inference engines with little effort, which not only effectively removes the
extra costs but also makes it compatible with most existing hardware platforms.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating single-instance scenes but
struggle with multi-instance scenarios, often merging or omitting objects.
Unlike previous training-free approaches that rely solely on semantic-level
guidance without addressing instance individuation, our training-free method,
Instance-to-Semantic Attention Control (ISAC), explicitly resolves incomplete
instance formation and semantic entanglement through an instance-first modeling
approach. This enables ISAC to effectively leverage a hierarchical,
tree-structured prompt mechanism, disentangling multiple object instances and
individually aligning them with their corresponding semantic labels. Without
employing any external models, ISAC achieves up to 52% average multi-class
accuracy and 83% average multi-instance accuracy by effectively forming
disentangled instances. The code will be made available upon publication.

Conclusion: PMA通过多层级信息融合，为点云理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Applying pre-trained models to assist point cloud understanding has recently
become a mainstream paradigm in 3D perception. However, existing application
strategies are straightforward, utilizing only the final output of the
pre-trained model for various task heads. It neglects the rich complementary
information in the intermediate layer, thereby failing to fully unlock the
potential of pre-trained models. To overcome this limitation, we propose an
orthogonal solution: Point Mamba Adapter (PMA), which constructs an ordered
feature sequence from all layers of the pre-trained model and leverages Mamba
to fuse all complementary semantics, thereby promoting comprehensive point
cloud understanding. Constructing this ordered sequence is non-trivial due to
the inherent isotropy of 3D space. Therefore, we further propose a
geometry-constrained gate prompt generator (G2PG) shared across different
layers, which applies shared geometric constraints to the output gates of the
Mamba and dynamically optimizes the spatial order, thus enabling more effective
integration of multi-layer information. Extensive experiments conducted on
challenging point cloud datasets across various tasks demonstrate that our PMA
elevates the capability for point cloud understanding to a new level by fusing
diverse complementary intermediate features. Code is available at

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an efficient and
cost-effective solution for perceiving surrounding scenes in autonomous
driving. However, existing works rely on explicit occupancy state inference,
leading to numerous incorrect feature assignments, and insufficient samples
restrict the learning of occupancy class inference. To address these
challenges, we propose leveraging Depth awareness and Semantic aid to boost
camera-based 3D semantic Occupancy prediction (DSOcc). We jointly perform
occupancy state and occupancy class inference, where soft occupancy confidence
is calculated through non-learning method and multiplied with image features to
make the voxel representation aware of depth, enabling adaptive implicit
occupancy state inference. Rather than focusing on improving feature learning,
we directly utilize well-trained image semantic segmentation and fuse multiple
frames with their occupancy probabilities to aid occupancy class inference,
thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DSOcc
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset among
camera-based methods.

Abstract: Personalized diffusion models have shown remarkable success in Text-to-Image
(T2I) generation by enabling the injection of user-defined concepts into
diverse contexts. However, balancing concept fidelity with contextual alignment
remains a challenging open problem. In this work, we propose an RL-based
approach that leverages the diverse outputs of T2I models to address this

a synthetic paired dataset for DPO-like training using external quality
metrics. These better-worse pairs are specifically constructed to improve both
concept fidelity and prompt adherence. Moreover, our approach supports flexible
adjustment of the trade-off between image fidelity and textual alignment.
Through multi-step training, our approach outperforms a naive baseline in
convergence speed and output quality. We conduct extensive qualitative and
quantitative analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method across
various architectures and fine-tuning techniques. The source code can be found

Conclusion: RefAV为场景挖掘提供了新方法和基准数据集，但需进一步优化VLMs。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) collect and pseudo-label terabytes of multi-modal
data localized to HD maps during normal fleet testing. However, identifying
interesting and safety-critical scenarios from uncurated driving logs remains a
significant challenge. Traditional scenario mining techniques are error-prone
and prohibitively time-consuming, often relying on hand-crafted structured
queries. In this work, we revisit spatio-temporal scenario mining through the
lens of recent vision-language models (VLMs) to detect whether a described
scenario occurs in a driving log and, if so, precisely localize it in both time
and space. To address this problem, we introduce RefAV, a large-scale dataset
of 10,000 diverse natural language queries that describe complex multi-agent
interactions relevant to motion planning derived from 1000 driving logs in the
Argoverse 2 Sensor dataset. We evaluate several referential multi-object
trackers and present an empirical analysis of our baselines. Notably, we find
that naively repurposing off-the-shelf VLMs yields poor performance, suggesting
that scenario mining presents unique challenges. Our code and dataset are

Motivation: SSFL在现实应用中面临领域偏移问题，传统方法假设训练和测试数据分布一致，但实际中领域偏移常见，因此需要提升模型的泛化能力。

Method: UAP框架包括两阶段训练：服务器模型学习并对齐特征分布，随后客户端利用服务器特征分布进行对齐训练。

Result: 在标准领域泛化基准数据集上的实验表明，UAP在半监督联邦学习设置中实现了最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: UAP通过创新的两阶段训练方法，有效解决了SSFL中的领域泛化问题，提升了模型的实用性。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (SSFL) is gaining popularity over
conventional Federated Learning in many real-world applications. Due to the
practical limitation of limited labeled data on the client side, SSFL considers
that participating clients train with unlabeled data, and only the central
server has the necessary resources to access limited labeled data, making it an
ideal fit for real-world applications (e.g., healthcare). However, traditional
SSFL assumes that the data distributions in the training phase and testing
phase are the same. In practice, however, domain shifts frequently occur,
making it essential for SSFL to incorporate generalization capabilities and
enhance their practicality. The core challenge is improving model
generalization to new, unseen domains while the client participate in SSFL.
However, the decentralized setup of SSFL and unsupervised client training
necessitates innovation to achieve improved generalization across domains. To
achieve this, we propose a novel framework called the Unified Alignment
Protocol (UAP), which consists of an alternating two-stage training process.
The first stage involves training the server model to learn and align the
features with a parametric distribution, which is subsequently communicated to
clients without additional communication overhead. The second stage proposes a
novel training algorithm that utilizes the server feature distribution to align
client features accordingly. Our extensive experiments on standard domain
generalization benchmark datasets across multiple model architectures reveal
that proposed UAP successfully achieves SOTA generalization performance in SSFL
setting.

DVL-Bench and DVL-Instruct. The DVL-Bench includes seven urban understanding

diverse urban dynamics including expansion/transformation patterns, disaster

multimodal large language models and reveal their limitations in long-term
temporal understanding and quantitative analysis. These challenges motivate the
creation of DVL-Instruct, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset designed to
enhance models' capabilities in multi-temporal Earth observation. Building upon

Abstract: Deep learning based image Super-Resolution (ISR) relies on large training
datasets to optimize model generalization; this requires substantial
computational and storage resources during training. While dataset condensation
has shown potential in improving data efficiency and privacy for high-level
computer vision tasks, it has not yet been fully exploited for ISR. In this
paper, we propose a novel Instance Data Condensation (IDC) framework
specifically for ISR, which achieves instance-level data condensation through
Random Local Fourier Feature Extraction and Multi-level Feature Distribution
Matching. This aims to optimize feature distributions at both global and local
levels and obtain high-quality synthesized training content with fine detail.
This framework has been utilized to condense the most commonly used training
dataset for ISR, DIV2K, with a 10% condensation rate. The resulting synthetic
dataset offers comparable or (in certain cases) even better performance
compared to the original full dataset and excellent training stability when
used to train various popular ISR models. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first time that a condensed/synthetic dataset (with a 10% data volume) has
demonstrated such performance. The source code and the synthetic dataset have

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation quality but at the
cost of numerous function evaluations. Recently, advanced ODE-based solvers
have been developed to mitigate the substantial computational demands of
reverse-diffusion solving under limited sampling steps. However, these solvers,
heavily inspired by Adams-like multistep methods, rely solely on t-related
Lagrange interpolation. We show that t-related Lagrange interpolation is
suboptimal for diffusion model and reveal a compact search space comprised of

novel differentiable solver search algorithm to identify more optimal solver.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
general-purpose robot control through natural language instructions. However,
their high inference cost-stemming from large-scale token computation and
autoregressive decoding-poses significant challenges for real-time deployment
and edge applications. While prior work has primarily focused on architectural
optimization, we take a different perspective by identifying a dual form of
redundancy in VLA models: (i) high similarity across consecutive action steps,
and (ii) substantial redundancy in visual tokens. Motivated by these
observations, we propose FlashVLA, the first training-free and plug-and-play
acceleration framework that enables action reuse in VLA models. FlashVLA
improves inference efficiency through a token-aware action reuse mechanism that
avoids redundant decoding across stable action steps, and an information-guided
visual token selection strategy that prunes low-contribution tokens. Extensive
experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that FlashVLA reduces FLOPs by 55.7%
and latency by 36.0%, with only a 0.7% drop in task success rate. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of FlashVLA in enabling lightweight, low-latency

Abstract: Frame inbetweening aims to synthesize intermediate video sequences
conditioned on the given start and end frames. Current state-of-the-art methods
mainly extend large-scale pre-trained Image-to-Video Diffusion models (I2V-DMs)
by incorporating end-frame constraints via directly fine-tuning or omitting
training. We identify a critical limitation in their design: Their injections
of the end-frame constraint usually utilize the same mechanism that originally
imposed the start-frame (single image) constraint. However, since the original
I2V-DMs are adequately trained for the start-frame condition in advance,
naively introducing the end-frame constraint by the same mechanism with much
less (even zero) specialized training probably can't make the end frame have a
strong enough impact on the intermediate content like the start frame. This
asymmetric control strength of the two frames over the intermediate content
likely leads to inconsistent motion or appearance collapse in generated frames.
To efficiently achieve symmetric constraints of start and end frames, we
propose a novel framework, termed Sci-Fi, which applies a stronger injection
for the constraint of a smaller training scale. Specifically, it deals with the
start-frame constraint as before, while introducing the end-frame constraint by
an improved mechanism. The new mechanism is based on a well-designed
lightweight module, named EF-Net, which encodes only the end frame and expands
it into temporally adaptive frame-wise features injected into the I2V-DM. This
makes the end-frame constraint as strong as the start-frame constraint,
enabling our Sci-Fi to produce more harmonious transitions in various
scenarios. Extensive experiments prove the superiority of our Sci-Fi compared
with other baselines.

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection has emerged as a promising solution to challenges
in data availability and labeling constraints. Traditional methods extract
features from different layers of pre-trained networks in Euclidean space;
however, Euclidean representations fail to effectively capture the hierarchical
relationships within these features, leading to suboptimal anomaly detection
performance. We propose a novel yet simple approach that projects feature
representations into hyperbolic space, aggregates them based on confidence
levels, and classifies samples as healthy or anomalous. Our experiments
demonstrate that hyperbolic space consistently outperforms Euclidean-based
frameworks, achieving higher AUROC scores at both image and pixel levels across
multiple medical benchmark datasets. Additionally, we show that hyperbolic
space exhibits resilience to parameter variations and excels in few-shot
scenarios, where healthy images are scarce. These findings underscore the
potential of hyperbolic space as a powerful alternative for medical anomaly
detection. The project website can be found at

Abstract: Occlusion Boundary Estimation (OBE) identifies boundaries arising from both
inter-object occlusions and self-occlusion within individual objects,
distinguishing intrinsic object edges from occlusion-induced contours to
improve scene understanding and 3D reconstruction capacity. This is closely
related to Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE), which infers depth from a single
image, as occlusion boundaries provide critical geometric cues for resolving
depth ambiguities, while depth priors can conversely refine occlusion reasoning
in complex scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel network, MoDOT, that first
jointly estimates depth and OBs. We propose CASM, a cross-attention multi-scale
strip convolution module, leverages mid-level OB features to significantly
enhance depth prediction. Additionally, we introduce an occlusion-aware loss
function, OBDCL, which encourages sharper and more accurate depth boundaries.
Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the
mutual benefits of jointly estimating depth and OB, and highlight the
effectiveness of our model design. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) on both our proposed synthetic datasets and one popular real dataset,
NYUD-v2, significantly outperforming multi-task baselines. Besides, without
domain adaptation, results on real-world depth transfer are comparable to the
competitors, while preserving sharp occlusion boundaries for geometric
fidelity. We will release our code, pre-trained models, and datasets to support
future research in this direction.

Abstract: Video Virtual Try-On (VVT) aims to simulate the natural appearance of
garments across consecutive video frames, capturing their dynamic variations
and interactions with human body motion. However, current VVT methods still
face challenges in terms of spatiotemporal consistency and garment content
preservation. First, they use diffusion models based on the U-Net, which are
limited in their expressive capability and struggle to reconstruct complex
details. Second, they adopt a separative modeling approach for spatial and
temporal attention, which hinders the effective capture of structural
relationships and dynamic consistency across frames. Third, their expression of
garment details remains insufficient, affecting the realism and stability of
the overall synthesized results, especially during human motion. To address the
above challenges, we propose MagicTryOn, a video virtual try-on framework built
upon the large-scale video diffusion Transformer.We replace the U-Net
architecture with a diffusion Transformer and combine full self-attention to
jointly model the spatiotemporal consistency of videos. We design a
coarse-to-fine garment preservation strategy. The coarse strategy integrates
garment tokens during the embedding stage, while the fine strategy incorporates
multiple garment-based conditions, such as semantics, textures, and contour
lines during the denoising stage. Moreover, we introduce a mask-aware loss to
further optimize garment region fidelity. Extensive experiments on both image
and video try-on datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SOTA
methods in comprehensive evaluations and generalizes to in-the-wild scenarios.

Abstract: Similarity manifests in various forms, including semantic similarity that is
particularly important, serving as an approximation of human object
categorization based on e.g. shared functionalities and evolutionary traits. It
also offers practical advantages in computational modeling via lexical
structures such as WordNet with constant and interpretable similarity. As in
the domain of deep vision, there is still not enough focus on the phenomena
regarding the similarity perception emergence. We introduce Deep Similarity
Inspector (DSI) -- a systematic framework to inspect how deep vision networks
develop their similarity perception and its alignment with semantic similarity.
Our experiments show that both Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers' (ViTs) develop a rich similarity perception during training with
3 phases (initial similarity surge, refinement, stabilization), with clear
differences between CNNs and ViTs. Besides the gradual mistakes elimination,
the mistakes refinement phenomenon can be observed.

Result: AgriFM在多项下游任务中表现优于传统深度学习和现有遥感基础模型。

Conclusion: AgriFM通过统一的时空处理和多源数据融合，显著提升了作物映射的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate crop mapping fundamentally relies on modeling multi-scale
spatiotemporal patterns, where spatial scales range from individual field
textures to landscape-level context, and temporal scales capture both
short-term phenological transitions and full growing-season dynamics.
Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising
potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified
spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop
mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the
multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information
by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present
AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed
for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the
necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction,
leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture
where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations.
This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series
satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three
satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is
pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image
samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates
a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned
spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over
conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose
RSFMs across all downstream tasks. Codes will be available at

Abstract: Object detection in remote sensing imagery remains a challenging task due to
extreme scale variation, dense object distributions, and cluttered backgrounds.
While recent detectors such as YOLOv8 have shown promising results, their
backbone architectures lack explicit mechanisms to guide multi-scale feature
refinement, limiting performance on high-resolution aerial data. In this work,
we propose YOLO-SPCI, an attention-enhanced detection framework that introduces
a lightweight Selective-Perspective-Class Integration (SPCI) module to improve
feature representation. The SPCI module integrates three components: a
Selective Stream Gate (SSG) for adaptive regulation of global feature flow, a
Perspective Fusion Module (PFM) for context-aware multi-scale integration, and
a Class Discrimination Module (CDM) to enhance inter-class separability. We
embed two SPCI blocks into the P3 and P5 stages of the YOLOv8 backbone,
enabling effective refinement while preserving compatibility with the original
neck and head. Experiments on the NWPU VHR-10 dataset demonstrate that
YOLO-SPCI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art detectors.

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing (RS) imagery offers valuable data

models due to two key bottlenecks: (1) limited availability of UHR training
data, and (2) token explosion caused by the large image size. To address data
scarcity, we introduce SuperRS-VQA (avg. 8,376$\times$8,376) and HighRS-VQA
(avg. 2,000$\times$1,912), the highest-resolution vision-language datasets in
RS to date, covering 22 real-world dialogue tasks. To mitigate token explosion,
our pilot studies reveal significant redundancy in RS images: crucial
information is concentrated in a small subset of object-centric tokens, while
pruning background tokens (e.g., ocean or forest) can even improve performance.
Motivated by these findings, we propose two strategies: Background Token
Pruning and Anchored Token Selection, to reduce the memory footprint while
preserving key semantics.Integrating these techniques, we introduce
GeoLLaVA-8K, the first RS-focused multimodal large language model capable of
handling inputs up to 8K$\times$8K resolution, built on the LLaVA framework.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representation learning capabilities, deep multi-view
clustering methods have demonstrated reliable performance by effectively
integrating multi-source information from diverse views in recent years. Most
existing methods rely on the assumption of clean views. However, noise is
pervasive in real-world scenarios, leading to a significant degradation in
performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel multi-view clustering
framework for the automatic identification and rectification of noisy data,
termed AIRMVC. Specifically, we reformulate noisy identification as an anomaly
identification problem using GMM. We then design a hybrid rectification
strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of noisy data based on the
identification results. Furthermore, we introduce a noise-robust contrastive
mechanism to generate reliable representations. Additionally, we provide a
theoretical proof demonstrating that these representations can discard noisy
information, thereby improving the performance of downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that AIRMVC outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of robustness in noisy scenarios. The code

Conclusion: OmniSync通过创新方法解决了唇同步中的关键挑战，为多样化视觉场景提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Lip synchronization is the task of aligning a speaker's lip movements in
video with corresponding speech audio, and it is essential for creating
realistic, expressive video content. However, existing methods often rely on
reference frames and masked-frame inpainting, which limit their robustness to
identity consistency, pose variations, facial occlusions, and stylized content.
In addition, since audio signals provide weaker conditioning than visual cues,
lip shape leakage from the original video will affect lip sync quality. In this
paper, we present OmniSync, a universal lip synchronization framework for
diverse visual scenarios. Our approach introduces a mask-free training paradigm
using Diffusion Transformer models for direct frame editing without explicit
masks, enabling unlimited-duration inference while maintaining natural facial
dynamics and preserving character identity. During inference, we propose a
flow-matching-based progressive noise initialization to ensure pose and
identity consistency, while allowing precise mouth-region editing. To address
the weak conditioning signal of audio, we develop a Dynamic Spatiotemporal
Classifier-Free Guidance (DS-CFG) mechanism that adaptively adjusts guidance
strength over time and space. We also establish the AIGC-LipSync Benchmark, the
first evaluation suite for lip synchronization in diverse AI-generated videos.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniSync significantly outperforms prior
methods in both visual quality and lip sync accuracy, achieving superior
results in both real-world and AI-generated videos.

Abstract: This paper presents DetailFlow, a coarse-to-fine 1D autoregressive (AR) image
generation method that models images through a novel next-detail prediction
strategy. By learning a resolution-aware token sequence supervised with
progressively degraded images, DetailFlow enables the generation process to
start from the global structure and incrementally refine details. This
coarse-to-fine 1D token sequence aligns well with the autoregressive inference
mechanism, providing a more natural and efficient way for the AR model to
generate complex visual content. Our compact 1D AR model achieves high-quality
image synthesis with significantly fewer tokens than previous approaches, i.e.
VAR/VQGAN. We further propose a parallel inference mechanism with
self-correction that accelerates generation speed by approximately 8x while
reducing accumulation sampling error inherent in teacher-forcing supervision.
On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, our method achieves 2.96 gFID with 128
tokens, outperforming VAR (3.3 FID) and FlexVAR (3.05 FID), which both require
680 tokens in their AR models. Moreover, due to the significantly reduced token
count and parallel inference mechanism, our method runs nearly 2x faster
inference speed compared to VAR and FlexVAR. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate DetailFlow's superior generation quality and efficiency compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Neural fields are a highly effective representation across visual computing.
This work observes that fitting these fields is greatly improved by
incorporating spatial stochasticity during training, and that this simple
technique can replace or even outperform custom-designed hierarchies and
frequency space constructions. The approach is formalized as implicitly
operating on a blurred version of the field, evaluated in-expectation by
sampling with Gaussian-distributed offsets. Querying the blurred field during
optimization greatly improves convergence and robustness, akin to the role of
preconditioners in numerical linear algebra. This implicit, sampling-based
perspective fits naturally into the neural field paradigm, comes at no
additional cost, and is extremely simple to implement. We describe the basic
theory of this technique, including details such as handling boundary
conditions, and extending to a spatially-varying blur. Experiments demonstrate
this approach on representations including coordinate MLPs, neural hashgrids,
triplanes, and more, across tasks including surface reconstruction and radiance
fields. In settings where custom-designed hierarchies have already been
developed, stochastic preconditioning nearly matches or improves their
performance with a simple and unified approach; in settings without existing
hierarchies it provides an immediate boost to quality and robustness.

Abstract: Achieving generalizable and precise robotic manipulation across diverse
environments remains a critical challenge, largely due to limitations in
spatial perception. While prior imitation-learning approaches have made
progress, their reliance on raw RGB inputs and handcrafted features often leads
to overfitting and poor 3D reasoning under varied lighting, occlusion, and

robust multimodal perception with reliable grasp prediction. Our architecture
fuses domain-randomized augmentation, monocular depth estimation, and a
depth-aware 6-DoF Grasp Prompt into a single spatial representation for
downstream action planning. Conditioned on this encoding and a high-level task
prompt, our diffusion-based policy yields precise action sequences, achieving
up to 40% improvement in grasp success and 45% higher task success rates under
environmental variation. These results demonstrate that spatially grounded
perception, paired with diffusion-based imitation learning, offers a scalable

Abstract: Learning visual representations from observing actions to benefit robot
visuo-motor policy generation is a promising direction that closely resembles
human cognitive function and perception. Motivated by this, and further
inspired by psychological theories suggesting that humans process scenes in an
object-based fashion, we propose an object-centric encoder that performs
semantic segmentation and visual representation generation in a coupled manner,
unlike other works, which treat these as separate processes. To achieve this,
we leverage the Slot Attention mechanism and use the SOLV model, pretrained in
large out-of-domain datasets, to bootstrap fine-tuning on human action video
data. Through simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that visual
representations can enhance reinforcement and imitation learning training,
highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated approach for semantic
segmentation and encoding. Furthermore, we show that exploiting models
pretrained on out-of-domain datasets can benefit this process, and that
fine-tuning on datasets depicting human actions -- although still out-of-domain
-- , can significantly improve performance due to close alignment with robotic
tasks. These findings show the capability to reduce reliance on annotated or
robot-specific action datasets and the potential to build on existing visual
encoders to accelerate training and improve generalizability.

Abstract: Existing human motion generation methods with trajectory and pose inputs
operate global processing on both modalities, leading to suboptimal outputs. In
this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based
on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory
and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first
stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the
second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a
Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity
is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose
data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under
trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented
to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the
agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the
optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study
with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents
pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We
believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability
of motion generation by the diffusion model.

Abstract: Function fitting/approximation plays a fundamental role in computer graphics
and other engineering applications. While recent advances have explored neural
networks to address this task, these methods often rely on architectures with
many parameters, limiting their practical applicability. In contrast, we pursue
high-quality function approximation using parameter-efficient representations
that eliminate the dependency on neural networks entirely. We first propose a
novel framework for continuous function modeling. Most existing works can be
formulated using this framework. We then introduce a compact function
representation, which is based on polynomials interpolated using radial basis
functions, bypassing both neural networks and complex/hierarchical data
structures. We also develop memory-efficient CUDA-optimized algorithms that
reduce computational time and memory consumption to less than 10% compared to
conventional automatic differentiation frameworks. Finally, we validate our
representation and optimization pipeline through extensive experiments on 3D
signed distance functions (SDFs). The proposed representation achieves
comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art techniques (e.g.,
octree/hash-grid techniques) with significantly fewer parameters.

Abstract: Synthesizing whole-body manipulation of articulated objects, including body
motion, hand motion, and object motion, is a critical yet challenging task with
broad applications in virtual humans and robotics. The core challenges are
twofold. First, achieving realistic whole-body motion requires tight
coordination between the hands and the rest of the body, as their movements are
interdependent during manipulation. Second, articulated object manipulation
typically involves high degrees of freedom and demands higher precision, often
requiring the fingers to be placed at specific regions to actuate movable
parts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel coordinated diffusion
noise optimization framework. Specifically, we perform noise-space optimization
over three specialized diffusion models for the body, left hand, and right
hand, each trained on its own motion dataset to improve generalization.
Coordination naturally emerges through gradient flow along the human kinematic
chain, allowing the global body posture to adapt in response to hand motion
objectives with high fidelity. To further enhance precision in hand-object
interaction, we adopt a unified representation based on basis point sets (BPS),
where end-effector positions are encoded as distances to the same BPS used for
object geometry. This unified representation captures fine-grained spatial
relationships between the hand and articulated object parts, and the resulting
trajectories serve as targets to guide the optimization of diffusion noise,
producing highly accurate interaction motion. We conduct extensive experiments
demonstrating that our method outperforms existing approaches in motion quality
and physical plausibility, and enables various capabilities such as object pose
control, simultaneous walking and manipulation, and whole-body generation from
hand-only data.

Abstract: We present DIPO, a novel framework for the controllable generation of
articulated 3D objects from a pair of images: one depicting the object in a
resting state and the other in an articulated state. Compared to the
single-image approach, our dual-image input imposes only a modest overhead for
data collection, but at the same time provides important motion information,
which is a reliable guide for predicting kinematic relationships between parts.
Specifically, we propose a dual-image diffusion model that captures
relationships between the image pair to generate part layouts and joint
parameters. In addition, we introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based graph
reasoner that explicitly infers part connectivity relationships. To further
improve robustness and generalization on complex articulated objects, we
develop a fully automated dataset expansion pipeline, name LEGO-Art, that
enriches the diversity and complexity of PartNet-Mobility dataset. We propose
PM-X, a large-scale dataset of complex articulated 3D objects, accompanied by
rendered images, URDF annotations, and textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DIPO significantly outperforms existing baselines
in both the resting state and the articulated state, while the proposed PM-X
dataset further enhances generalization to diverse and structurally complex
articulated objects. Our code and dataset will be released to the community

Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensing has been widely used in perception,
reconstruction, and robotic manipulation. However, collecting large-scale
tactile data remains costly due to the localized nature of sensor-object
interactions and inconsistencies across sensor instances. Existing approaches
to scaling tactile data, such as simulation and free-form tactile generation,
often suffer from unrealistic output and poor transferability to downstream
tasks.To address this, we propose ControlTac, a two-stage controllable
framework that generates realistic tactile images conditioned on a single
reference tactile image, contact force, and contact position. With those
physical priors as control input, ControlTac generates physically plausible and
varied tactile images that can be used for effective data augmentation. Through
experiments on three downstream tasks, we demonstrate that ControlTac can
effectively augment tactile datasets and lead to consistent gains. Our three
real-world experiments further validate the practical utility of our approach.

Abstract: The global challenge of sustainable recycling demands automated, fast, and

materials classification. The dataset comprises 55 co-registered
high-resolution RGB images and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data cubes spanning

the Multimodal Fusion Transformer, to investigate architectural bottlenecks for
further efficiency optimisation when deploying transformers in material
identification. We implement zero-shot detection techniques and majority voting

robustness. In adherence to the FAIR data principles, the electrolyzers-HSI

Abstract: Face reenactment and portrait relighting are essential tasks in portrait

Most face reenactment methods prioritize motion control and multiview

introduce Total-Editing, a unified portrait editing framework that enables
precise control over appearance, motion, and lighting. Specifically, we design
a neural radiance field decoder with intrinsic decomposition capabilities. This
allows seamless integration of lighting information from portrait images or HDR
environment maps into synthesized portraits. We also incorporate a moving least
squares based deformation field to enhance the spatiotemporal coherence of
avatar motion and shading effects. With these innovations, our unified
framework significantly improves the quality and realism of portrait editing
results. Further, the multi-source nature of Total-Editing supports more
flexible applications, such as illumination transfer from one portrait to
another, or portrait animation with customized backgrounds.

Conclusion: OmniIndoor3D填补了室内3D重建的关键空白，支持精确的机器人导航。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for comprehensive indoor 3D reconstruction using
Gaussian representations, called OmniIndoor3D. This framework enables accurate
appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction of diverse indoor scenes
captured by a consumer-level RGB-D camera. Since 3DGS is primarily optimized
for photorealistic rendering, it lacks the precise geometry critical for
high-quality panoptic reconstruction. Therefore, OmniIndoor3D first combines
multiple RGB-D images to create a coarse 3D reconstruction, which is then used
to initialize the 3D Gaussians and guide the 3DGS training. To decouple the
optimization conflict between appearance and geometry, we introduce a
lightweight MLP that adjusts the geometric properties of 3D Gaussians. The
introduced lightweight MLP serves as a low-pass filter for geometry
reconstruction and significantly reduces noise in indoor scenes. To improve the
distribution of Gaussian primitives, we propose a densification strategy guided
by panoptic priors to encourage smoothness on planar surfaces. Through the
joint optimization of appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction,
OmniIndoor3D provides comprehensive 3D indoor scene understanding, which
facilitates accurate and robust robotic navigation. We perform thorough
evaluations across multiple datasets, and OmniIndoor3D achieves
state-of-the-art results in appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction.
We believe our work bridges a critical gap in indoor 3D reconstruction. The

Method: 使用AffectNet数据集和MobileNet模型，比较ITA和$L^*$-$H^*$方法在肤色分类中的表现，并通过F1-score、TPR等指标评估公平性。

Result: 结果显示深肤色群体代表性不足（约2%），且ITA方法因对光照敏感而表现不佳，$L^*$-$H^*$方法更一致且能提供更清晰的公平性诊断。

Conclusion: 肤色分类方法的选择对公平性评估至关重要，ITA可能低估深肤色群体的差异。研究还提出了一个模块化的公平性评估流程。

Abstract: Understanding how facial affect analysis (FAA) systems perform across
different demographic groups requires reliable measurement of sensitive
attributes such as ancestry, often approximated by skin tone, which itself is
highly influenced by lighting conditions. This study compares two objective
skin tone classification methods: the widely used Individual Typology Angle
(ITA) and a perceptually grounded alternative based on Lightness ($L^*$) and
Hue ($H^*$). Using AffectNet and a MobileNet-based model, we assess fairness
across skin tone groups defined by each method. Results reveal a severe
underrepresentation of dark skin tones ($\sim 2 \%$), alongside fairness
disparities in F1-score (up to 0.08) and TPR (up to 0.11) across groups. While
ITA shows limitations due to its sensitivity to lighting, the $H^*$-$L^*$
method yields more consistent subgrouping and enables clearer diagnostics
through metrics such as Equal Opportunity. Grad-CAM analysis further highlights
differences in model attention patterns by skin tone, suggesting variation in
feature encoding. To support future mitigation efforts, we also propose a
modular fairness-aware pipeline that integrates perceptual skin tone
estimation, model interpretability, and fairness evaluation. These findings
emphasize the relevance of skin tone measurement choices in fairness assessment
and suggest that ITA-based evaluations may overlook disparities affecting
darker-skinned individuals.

Conclusion: LIAR通过光照感知设计显著提升了夜间3D占用预测的性能。

Abstract: Occupancy prediction aims to estimate the 3D spatial distribution of occupied
regions along with their corresponding semantic labels. Existing vision-based
methods perform well on daytime benchmarks but struggle in nighttime scenarios
due to limited visibility and challenging lighting conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{LIAR}, a novel framework that learns
illumination-affined representations. LIAR first introduces Selective Low-light
Image Enhancement (SLLIE), which leverages the illumination priors from daytime
scenes to adaptively determine whether a nighttime image is genuinely dark or
sufficiently well-lit, enabling more targeted global enhancement. Building on
the illumination maps generated by SLLIE, LIAR further incorporates two
illumination-aware components: 2D Illumination-guided Sampling (2D-IGS) and 3D
Illumination-driven Projection (3D-IDP), to respectively tackle local
underexposure and overexposure. Specifically, 2D-IGS modulates feature sampling
positions according to illumination maps, assigning larger offsets to darker
regions and smaller ones to brighter regions, thereby alleviating feature
degradation in underexposed areas. Subsequently, 3D-IDP enhances semantic
understanding in overexposed regions by constructing illumination intensity
fields and supplying refined residual queries to the BEV context refinement
process. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of LIAR under challenging nighttime scenarios. The

Abstract: In AI-empowered poster design, content-aware layout generation is crucial for
the on-image arrangement of visual-textual elements, e.g., logo, text, and
underlay. To perceive the background images, existing work demanded a high
parameter count that far exceeds the size of available training data, which has
impeded the model's real-time performance and generalization ability. To
address these challenges, we proposed a patch-level data summarization and
augmentation approach, vividly named Scan-and-Print. Specifically, the scan
procedure selects only the patches suitable for placing element vertices to
perform fine-grained perception efficiently. Then, the print procedure mixes up
the patches and vertices across two image-layout pairs to synthesize over 100%
new samples in each epoch while preserving their plausibility. Besides, to
facilitate the vertex-level operations, a vertex-based layout representation is
introduced. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks
demonstrated that Scan-and-Print can generate visually appealing layouts with
state-of-the-art quality while dramatically reducing computational bottleneck

Abstract: Recent advancements in domain generalization for deepfake detection have
attracted significant attention, with previous methods often incorporating
additional modules to prevent overfitting to domain-specific patterns. However,
such regularization can hinder the optimization of the empirical risk
minimization (ERM) objective, ultimately degrading model performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel learning objective that aligns generalization
gradient updates with ERM gradient updates. The key innovation is the
application of perturbations to model parameters, aligning the ascending points
across domains, which specifically enhances the robustness of deepfake
detection models to domain shifts. This approach effectively preserves
domain-invariant features while managing domain-specific characteristics,
without introducing additional regularization. Experimental results on multiple
challenging deepfake detection datasets demonstrate that our gradient alignment
strategy outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques,
confirming the efficacy of our method. The code is available at

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new cross-domain face forgery detection method

ensuring an acceptable low false positive rate. Although existing face forgery
detection methods are applicable to multiple domains to some degree, they often
come with a high false positive rate, which can greatly disrupt the usability

Network (CDN) based on a robust desensitization algorithm, which captures the
essential domain characteristics through learning them from domain
transformation over pairs of genuine face images. One advantage of CDN lies in
that the learnt face representation is theoretical justified with regard to the
its robustness against the domain changes. Extensive experiments over
large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a much
lower false alarm rate with improved detection accuracy compared to several
state-of-the-art methods.

monitor student participation, identify disengagement, and adapt their teaching

key challenges in this problem: class imbalance and incorporating order into
engagement levels rather than treating it as mere categories. Then, a novel
approach to video-based student engagement measurement in virtual learning
environments is proposed that utilizes supervised contrastive learning for
ordinal classification of engagement. Various affective and behavioral features
are extracted from video samples and utilized to train ordinal classifiers
within a supervised contrastive learning framework (with a sequential
classifier as the encoder). A key step involves the application of diverse
time-series data augmentation techniques to these feature vectors, enhancing
model training. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using a
publicly available dataset for engagement measurement, DAiSEE, containing
videos of students who participated in virtual learning programs. The results
demonstrate the robust ability of the proposed method for the classification of

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is challenged by
limited interpretability, which significantly impacts cross-dataset
generalization. To address this challenge, we propose Motion-Primitive
Transformer (MoPFormer), a novel self-supervised framework that enhances
interpretability by tokenizing inertial measurement unit signals into
semantically meaningful motion primitives and leverages a Transformer
architecture to learn rich temporal representations. MoPFormer comprises
two-stages. first stage is to partition multi-channel sensor streams into short
segments and quantizing them into discrete "motion primitive" codewords, while
the second stage enriches those tokenized sequences through a context-aware
embedding module and then processes them with a Transformer encoder. The
proposed MoPFormer can be pre-trained using a masked motion-modeling objective
that reconstructs missing primitives, enabling it to develop robust
representations across diverse sensor configurations. Experiments on six HAR
benchmarks demonstrate that MoPFormer not only outperforms state-of-the-art
methods but also successfully generalizes across multiple datasets. Most
importantly, the learned motion primitives significantly enhance both
interpretability and cross-dataset performance by capturing fundamental
movement patterns that remain consistent across similar activities regardless
of dataset origin.

Abstract: Image fusion aims to combine complementary information from multiple source
images to generate more comprehensive scene representations. Existing methods
primarily rely on the stacking and design of network architectures to enhance
the fusion performance, often ignoring the impact of dataset scene bias on
model training. This oversight leads the model to learn spurious correlations
between specific scenes and fusion weights under conventional likelihood
estimation framework, thereby limiting fusion performance. To solve the above
problems, this paper first re-examines the image fusion task from the causality
perspective, and disentangles the model from the impact of bias by constructing

the true causal effect. Finally, Extensive experiments on three standard

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前融合方法在复杂环境中实现高性能时计算开销大，且难以高效提取事件流中的稀疏异步信息，未能充分利用事件驱动脉冲范式的能效优势。

Method: 提出SpikeFET框架，结合卷积和Transformer，引入随机拼图模块（RPM）消除位置偏差，并提出时空正则化（STR）策略增强特征一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SpikeFET在跟踪精度上优于现有方法，同时显著降低功耗。

Conclusion: SpikeFET在性能和效率之间实现了最佳平衡，为视觉对象跟踪提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of image and event streams offers a promising approach for
achieving robust visual object tracking in complex environments. However,
current fusion methods achieve high performance at the cost of significant
computational overhead and struggle to efficiently extract the sparse,
asynchronous information from event streams, failing to leverage the
energy-efficient advantages of event-driven spiking paradigms. To address this
challenge, we propose the first fully Spiking Frame-Event Tracking framework
called SpikeFET. This network achieves synergistic integration of convolutional
local feature extraction and Transformer-based global modeling within the
spiking paradigm, effectively fusing frame and event data. To overcome the
degradation of translation invariance caused by convolutional padding, we
introduce a Random Patchwork Module (RPM) that eliminates positional bias
through randomized spatial reorganization and learnable type encoding while
preserving residual structures. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal
Regularization (STR) strategy that overcomes similarity metric degradation from
asymmetric features by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency among temporal
template features in latent space. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior tracking
accuracy over existing methods while significantly reducing power consumption,
attaining an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. The code will
be released.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new control signal for facial motion generation:
timeline control. Compared to audio and text signals, timelines provide more
fine-grained control, such as generating specific facial motions with precise
timing. Users can specify a multi-track timeline of facial actions arranged in
temporal intervals, allowing precise control over the timing of each action. To
model the timeline control capability, We first annotate the time intervals of
facial actions in natural facial motion sequences at a frame-level granularity.
This process is facilitated by Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-based Clustering to
minimize human labor. Based on the annotations, we propose a diffusion-based
generation model capable of generating facial motions that are natural and
accurately aligned with input timelines. Our method supports text-guided motion
generation by using ChatGPT to convert text into timelines. Experimental
results show that our method can annotate facial action intervals with
satisfactory accuracy, and produces natural facial motions accurately aligned

Abstract: Neural fields (NFs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in scene
reconstruction, powering various tasks such as novel view synthesis. However,
existing NF methods relying on RGB or LiDAR inputs often exhibit severe
fragility to adverse weather, particularly when applied in outdoor scenarios
like autonomous driving. In contrast, millimeter-wave radar is inherently
robust to environmental changes, while unfortunately, its integration with NFs

involve moving objects, making spatiotemporal modeling essential for temporally
consistent novel view synthesis. To this end, we introduce RF4D, a radar-based
neural field framework specifically designed for novel view synthesis in
outdoor dynamic scenes. RF4D explicitly incorporates temporal information into
its representation, significantly enhancing its capability to model moving
objects. We further introduce a feature-level flow module that predicts latent
temporal offsets between adjacent frames, enforcing temporal coherence in
dynamic scene modeling. Moreover, we propose a radar-specific power rendering

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of computer vision applications necessitates
handling vast amounts of visual data, often containing personal information.
While this technology offers significant benefits, it should not compromise
privacy. Data privacy regulations emphasize the need for individual consent for
processing personal data, hindering researchers' ability to collect
high-quality datasets containing the faces of the individuals. This paper
presents a deep learning-based face anonymization pipeline to overcome this

realistic face generation using the state-of-the-art BrushNet diffusion model.
BrushNet utilizes the entire image, face masks, and text prompts specifying
desired facial attributes like age, ethnicity, gender, and expression. This

Abstract: Despite the availability of large-scale 3D datasets and advancements in 3D
generative models, the complexity and uneven quality of 3D geometry and texture
data continue to hinder the performance of 3D generation techniques. In most
existing approaches, 3D geometry and texture are generated in separate stages
using different models and non-unified representations, frequently leading to
unsatisfactory coherence between geometry and texture. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for joint generation of 3D geometry
and texture. Specifically, we focus in generate a versatile 2.5D
representations that can be seamlessly transformed between 2D and 3D. Our
approach begins by integrating multiview RGB, normal, and coordinate images
into a unified representation, termed as 2.5D latents. Next, we adapt
pre-trained 2D foundation models for high-fidelity 2.5D generation, utilizing
both text and image conditions. Finally, we introduce a lightweight 2.5D-to-3D
refiner-decoder framework that efficiently generates detailed 3D
representations from 2.5D images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model not only excels in generating high-quality 3D objects with coherent
structure and color from text and image inputs but also significantly

Abstract: Stylizing 3D scenes instantly while maintaining multi-view consistency and
faithfully resembling a style image remains a significant challenge. Current
state-of-the-art 3D stylization methods typically involve computationally
intensive test-time optimization to transfer artistic features into a
pretrained 3D representation, often requiring dense posed input images. In
contrast, leveraging recent advances in feed-forward reconstruction models, we
demonstrate a novel approach to achieve direct 3D stylization in less than a
second using unposed sparse-view scene images and an arbitrary style image. To
address the inherent decoupling between reconstruction and stylization, we
introduce a branched architecture that separates structure modeling and
appearance shading, effectively preventing stylistic transfer from distorting
the underlying 3D scene structure. Furthermore, we adapt an identity loss to
facilitate pre-training our stylization model through the novel view synthesis
task. This strategy also allows our model to retain its original reconstruction
capabilities while being fine-tuned for stylization. Comprehensive evaluations,
using both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, demonstrate that our approach
produces high-quality stylized 3D content that achieve a superior blend of
style and scene appearance, while also outperforming existing methods in terms
of multi-view consistency and efficiency.

Abstract: While virtual try-on (VTON) systems aim to render a garment onto a target
person image, this paper tackles the novel task of virtual try-off (VTOFF),
which addresses the inverse problem: generating standardized product images of
garments from real-world photos of clothed individuals. Unlike VTON, which must
resolve diverse pose and style variations, VTOFF benefits from a consistent and
well-defined output format -- typically a flat, lay-down-style representation
of the garment -- making it a promising tool for data generation and dataset
enhancement. However, existing VTOFF approaches face two major limitations: (i)
difficulty in disentangling garment features from occlusions and complex poses,
often leading to visual artifacts, and (ii) restricted applicability to
single-category garments (e.g., upper-body clothes only), limiting
generalization. To address these challenges, we present Text-Enhanced
MUlti-category Virtual Try-Off (TEMU-VTOFF), a novel architecture featuring a
dual DiT-based backbone with a modified multimodal attention mechanism for
robust garment feature extraction. Our architecture is designed to receive
garment information from multiple modalities like images, text, and masks to
work in a multi-category setting. Finally, we propose an additional alignment
module to further refine the generated visual details. Experiments on VITON-HD
and Dress Code datasets show that TEMU-VTOFF sets a new state-of-the-art on the
VTOFF task, significantly improving both visual quality and fidelity to the
target garments.

Abstract: Robust unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) in real-world scenarios is an
important task. Current methods exhibit severe performance degradation on the
MVTec AD 2 benchmark due to its complex real-world challenges. To solve this

modules: (1) Swin-Cropping, a high-resolution image pre-processing strategy to
preserve the information of small anomalies through overlapping window
cropping. (2) The data augmentation of noise addition and lighting simulation
is carried out on the training data to improve the robustness of AD model. We
use INP-Former as our baseline, which could generate better results on the
various sub-images. (3) The traditional statistical-based binarization strategy

Abstract: Event cameras offer high temporal resolution and power efficiency, making
them well-suited for edge AI applications. However, their high event rates
present challenges for data transmission and processing. Subsampling methods
provide a practical solution, but their effect on downstream visual tasks
remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically evaluate six
hardware-friendly subsampling methods using convolutional neural networks for
event video classification on various benchmark datasets. We hypothesize that
events from high-density regions carry more task-relevant information and are
therefore better suited for subsampling. To test this, we introduce a simple
causal density-based subsampling method, demonstrating improved classification
accuracy in sparse regimes. Our analysis further highlights key factors
affecting subsampling performance, including sensitivity to hyperparameters and
failure cases in scenarios with large event count variance. These findings
provide insights for utilization of hardware-efficient subsampling strategies

Abstract: Novel view synthesis for underwater scene reconstruction presents unique
challenges due to complex light-media interactions. Optical scattering and
absorption in water body bring inhomogeneous medium attenuation interference
that disrupts conventional volume rendering assumptions of uniform propagation
medium. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers real-time rendering
capabilities, it struggles with underwater inhomogeneous environments where
scattering media introduce artifacts and inconsistent appearance. In this
study, we propose a physics-based framework that disentangles object appearance
from water medium effects through tailored Gaussian modeling. Our approach
introduces appearance embeddings, which are explicit medium representations for
backscatter and attenuation, enhancing scene consistency. In addition, we
propose a distance-guided optimization strategy that leverages pseudo-depth
maps as supervision with depth regularization and scale penalty terms to
improve geometric fidelity. By integrating the proposed appearance and medium
modeling components via an underwater imaging model, our approach achieves both
high-quality novel view synthesis and physically accurate scene restoration.

restoration accuracy over existing methods. The project page is available at

loss is developed to optimize the geometry of the scene and improve the ordinal
consistency of the depth maps. Extensive experiments on real-world underwater

Sentinel-2 imagery across six wetland regions in the Netherlands, achieving a
baseline model accuracy of 85.26%.
  Addressing the limited availability of labeled data, the results show that
SSL pretraining with an autoencoder can improve accuracy, especially for the
high-resolution imagery where it is more difficult to obtain labeled data,
reaching an accuracy of 88.23%.
  Furthermore, we introduce a framework to scale manually annotated
high-resolution labels to medium-resolution inputs. While the quantitative
performance between resolutions is comparable, high-resolution imagery provides
significantly sharper segmentation boundaries and finer spatial detail.
  As part of this work, we also contribute a curated Sentinel-2 dataset with
Dynamic World labels, tailored for wetland classification tasks and made
publicly available.

Abstract: Enhancing plant disease detection from leaf imagery remains a persistent

for intelligent image preprocessing, coupled with sophisticated attention
mechanisms that dynamically recalibrate feature representations. Our

Dream3DVG, allowing for arbitrary viewpoint viewing, progressive detail
optimization, and view-dependent occlusion awareness. Our approach is a
dual-branch optimization framework, consisting of an auxiliary 3D Gaussian
Splatting optimization branch and a 3D vector graphics optimization branch. The
introduced 3DGS branch can bridge the domain gaps between text prompts and
vector graphics with more consistent guidance. Moreover, 3DGS allows for
progressive detail control by scheduling classifier-free guidance, facilitating
guiding vector graphics with coarse shapes at the initial stages and finer
details at later stages. We also improve the view-dependent occlusions by
devising a visibility-awareness rendering module. Extensive results on 3D

Abstract: Multimodal feature reconstruction is a promising approach for 3D anomaly
detection, leveraging the complementary information from dual modalities. We
further advance this paradigm by utilizing multi-modal mentor learning, which
fuses intermediate features to further distinguish normal from feature
differences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called
Mentor3AD, which utilizes multi-modal mentor learning. By leveraging the shared
features of different modalities, Mentor3AD can extract more effective features
and guide feature reconstruction, ultimately improving detection performance.
Specifically, Mentor3AD includes a Mentor of Fusion Module (MFM) that merges
features extracted from RGB and 3D modalities to create a mentor feature.
Additionally, we have designed a Mentor of Guidance Module (MGM) to facilitate
cross-modal reconstruction, supported by the mentor feature. Lastly, we
introduce a Voting Module (VM) to more accurately generate the final anomaly
score. Extensive comparative and ablation studies on MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies
have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

state-of-the-art harmonized results across standard benchmarks and our dataset,
as well as casually captured real-world scenes demonstrate the framework's

Conclusion: 为全自动海报生成模型提供了明确方向。

Abstract: Academic poster generation is a crucial yet challenging task in scientific
communication, requiring the compression of long-context interleaved documents
into a single, visually coherent page. To address this challenge, we introduce
the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent
conference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on
(i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual
Coherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic
and informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably
(iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by
VLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose
PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser
distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns
text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and
spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by
executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and
ensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o
outputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and
poor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary
aesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual
semantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the
Qwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across
nearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens. It transforms a 22-page paper
into a finalized yet editable .pptx poster - all for just $0.005. These
findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated
poster-generation models. The code and datasets are available at

Abstract: We propose GRGS, a generalizable and relightable 3D Gaussian framework for

Unlike existing methods that rely on per-character optimization or ignore

that projects geometry, material, and illumination cues from multi-view 2D
observations into 3D Gaussian representations. Specifically, to reconstruct
lighting-invariant geometry, we introduce a Lighting-aware Geometry Refinement
(LGR) module trained on synthetically relit data to predict accurate depth and
surface normals. Based on the high-quality geometry, a Physically Grounded
Neural Rendering (PGNR) module is further proposed to integrate neural
prediction with physics-based shading, supporting editable relighting with
shadows and indirect illumination. Besides, we design a 2D-to-3D projection
training scheme that leverages differentiable supervision from ambient
occlusion, direct, and indirect lighting maps, which alleviates the
computational cost of explicit ray tracing. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRGS achieves superior visual quality, geometric consistency, and

Conclusion: 3D detailizer在细节生成、速度和结构控制上表现出色，为交互式3D建模提供了新工具。

Abstract: We introduce a 3D detailizer, a neural model which can instantaneously (in
<1s) transform a coarse 3D shape proxy into a high-quality asset with detailed
geometry and texture as guided by an input text prompt. Our model is trained
using the text prompt, which defines the shape class and characterizes the
appearance and fine-grained style of the generated details. The coarse 3D
proxy, which can be easily varied and adjusted (e.g., via user editing),
provides structure control over the final shape. Importantly, our detailizer is
not optimized for a single shape; it is the result of distilling a generative
model, so that it can be reused, without retraining, to generate any number of
shapes, with varied structures, whose local details all share a consistent
style and appearance. Our detailizer training utilizes a pretrained multi-view
image diffusion model, with text conditioning, to distill the foundational
knowledge therein into our detailizer via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To
improve SDS and enable our detailizer architecture to learn generalizable
features over complex structures, we train our model in two training stages to
generate shapes with increasing structural complexity. Through extensive
experiments, we show that our method generates shapes of superior quality and
details compared to existing text-to-3D models under varied structure control.
Our detailizer can refine a coarse shape in less than a second, making it
possible to interactively author and adjust 3D shapes. Furthermore, the
user-imposed structure control can lead to creative, and hence
out-of-distribution, 3D asset generations that are beyond the current
capabilities of leading text-to-3D generative models. We demonstrate an
interactive 3D modeling workflow our method enables, and its strong
generalizability over styles, structures, and object categories.

Conclusion: fcHMRF-LIS是一种强大、稳定且可扩展的空间FDR控制方法，适用于高分辨率神经影像数据。

Abstract: False discovery rate (FDR) control methods are essential for voxel-wise
multiple testing in neuroimaging data analysis, where hundreds of thousands or
even millions of tests are conducted to detect brain regions associated with
disease-related changes. Classical FDR control methods (e.g., BH, q-value, and
LocalFDR) assume independence among tests and often lead to high false
non-discovery rates (FNR). Although various spatial FDR control methods have
been developed to improve power, they still fall short in jointly addressing
three major challenges in neuroimaging applications: capturing complex spatial
dependencies, maintaining low variability in both false discovery proportion
(FDP) and false non-discovery proportion (FNP) across replications, and
achieving computational scalability for high-resolution data. To address these
challenges, we propose fcHMRF-LIS, a powerful, stable, and scalable spatial FDR
control method for voxel-wise multiple testing. It integrates the local index
of significance (LIS)-based testing procedure with a novel fully connected
hidden Markov random field (fcHMRF) designed to model complex spatial
structures using a parsimonious parameterization. We develop an efficient
expectation-maximization algorithm incorporating mean-field approximation, the
Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) technique, and
permutohedral lattice filtering, reducing the computational complexity from
quadratic to linear in the number of tests. Extensive simulations demonstrate
that fcHMRF-LIS achieves accurate FDR control, lower FNR, reduced variability
in FDP and FNP, and a higher number of true positives compared to existing
methods. Applied to an FDG-PET dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative, fcHMRF-LIS identifies neurobiologically relevant brain
regions and offers notable advantages in computational efficiency.

Abstract: This work introduces Ui2i, a novel model for unpaired image-to-image

across domains while preserving content. Building on CycleGAN, Ui2i
incorporates key modifications to better disentangle content and style
features, and preserve content integrity. Specifically, Ui2i employs
U-Net-based generators with skip connections to propagate localized shallow
features deep into the generator. Ui2i removes feature-based normalization
layers from all modules and replaces them with approximate bidirectional
spectral normalization -- a parameter-based alternative that enhances training
stability. To further support content preservation, channel and spatial
attention mechanisms are integrated into the generators. Training is
facilitated through image scale augmentation. Evaluation on two biomedical
tasks -- domain adaptation for nuclear segmentation in immunohistochemistry
(IHC) images and unmixing of biological structures superimposed in
single-channel immunofluorescence (IF) images -- demonstrates Ui2i's ability to
preserve content fidelity in settings that demand more accurate structural
preservation than typical translation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Ui2i
is the first approach capable of separating superimposed signals in IF images

Abstract: Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing can capture dynamical evolution of
materials. Despite its capability, current methods emphasize variability of
endmembers while neglecting dynamics of abundances, which motivates our
adoption of neural ordinary differential equations to model abundances
temporally. However, this motivation is hindered by two challenges: the
inherent complexity in defining, modeling and solving problem, and the absence
of theoretical support. To address above challenges, in this paper, we propose
a multitemporal latent dynamical (MiLD) unmixing framework by capturing
dynamical evolution of materials with theoretical validation. For addressing
multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing, MiLD consists of problem definition,
mathematical modeling, solution algorithm and theoretical support. We formulate
multitemporal unmixing problem definition by conducting ordinary differential
equations and developing latent variables. We transfer multitemporal unmixing
to mathematical model by dynamical discretization approaches, which describe
the discreteness of observed sequence images with mathematical expansions. We
propose algorithm to solve problem and capture dynamics of materials, which
approximates abundance evolution by neural networks. Furthermore, we provide
theoretical support by validating the crucial properties, which verifies
consistency, convergence and stability theorems. The major contributions of
MiLD include defining problem by ordinary differential equations, modeling
problem by dynamical discretization approach, solving problem by multitemporal
unmixing algorithm, and presenting theoretical support. Our experiments on both
synthetic and real datasets have validated the utility of our work

Abstract: While learned image compression (LIC) focuses on efficient data transmission,
generative image compression (GIC) extends this framework by integrating
generative modeling to produce photo-realistic reconstructed images. In this
paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based generative modeling framework
tailored for generative image compression. Unlike prior diffusion-based
approaches that indirectly exploit diffusion modeling, we reinterpret the
compression process itself as a forward diffusion path governed by stochastic
differential equations (SDEs). A reverse neural network is trained to
reconstruct images by reversing the compression process directly, without
requiring Gaussian noise initialization. This approach achieves smooth rate
adjustment and photo-realistic reconstructions with only a minimal number of
sampling steps. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing generative image compression approaches across
a range of metrics, including perceptual distortion, statistical fidelity, and
no-reference quality assessments.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of large-scale urban scenes is critical for
applications such as AR navigation, UAV based inspection, and smart city
digital twins. While aerial imagery offers broad coverage and complements
limitations of ground-based data, reconstructing city-scale environments from
such views remains challenging due to occlusions, incomplete geometry, and high
memory demands. Recent advances like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) improve
scalability and visual quality but remain limited by dense primitive usage,
long training times, and poor suit ability for edge devices. We propose CityGo,
a hybrid framework that combines textured proxy geometry with residual and
surrounding 3D Gaussians for lightweight, photorealistic rendering of urban
scenes from aerial perspectives. Our approach first extracts compact building
proxy meshes from MVS point clouds, then uses zero order SH Gaussians to
generate occlusion-free textures via image-based rendering and back-projection.
To capture high-frequency details, we introduce residual Gaussians placed based
on proxy-photo discrepancies and guided by depth priors. Broader urban context
is represented by surrounding Gaussians, with importance-aware downsampling
applied to non-critical regions to reduce redundancy. A tailored optimization
strategy jointly refines proxy textures and Gaussian parameters, enabling
real-time rendering of complex urban scenes on mobile GPUs with significantly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感计算中多标注者数据常被合并为单一标签，丢失了标注者间的变异性，希望充分利用多标注者数据。

Method: 使用共识网络聚合多标注者数据，指导主预测器（arousal-valence）更好地反映集体输入。

Result: 在RECOLA和COGNIMUSE数据集上表现优于传统单标签方法。

Conclusion: 多标注者数据在情感识别中具有优势，适用于标注丰富但不一致的领域。

Abstract: In affective computing, datasets often contain multiple annotations from
different annotators, which may lack full agreement. Typically, these
annotations are merged into a single gold standard label, potentially losing
valuable inter-rater variability. We propose a multi-annotator training
approach for continuous emotion recognition (CER) that seeks a consensus across
all annotators rather than relying on a single reference label. Our method
employs a consensus network to aggregate annotations into a unified
representation, guiding the main arousal-valence predictor to better reflect
collective inputs. Tested on the RECOLA and COGNIMUSE datasets, our approach
outperforms traditional methods that unify annotations into a single label.
This underscores the benefits of fully leveraging multi-annotator data in
emotion recognition and highlights its applicability across various fields
where annotations are abundant yet inconsistent.

Abstract: In this work, we present WeatherEdit, a novel weather editing pipeline for
generating realistic weather effects with controllable types and severity in 3D
scenes. Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background
editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we
introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a
single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather
effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View
(TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal
and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and
multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a
3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field
to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and
dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based
modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and
flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with
the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects.
Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can
generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity,
highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse
weather. See project page: https://jumponthemoon.github.io/w-edit

Conclusion: DCT和迁移学习的结合显著提升了OSA患者高血压风险预测的准确性。

Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a significant risk factor for hypertension,
primarily due to intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation. Predicting
whether individuals with OSA will develop hypertension within five years
remains a complex challenge. This study introduces a novel deep learning
approach that integrates Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based transfer
learning to enhance prediction accuracy. We are the first to incorporate all
polysomnography signals together for hypertension prediction, leveraging their
collective information to improve model performance. Features were extracted
from these signals and transformed into a 2D representation to utilize
pre-trained 2D neural networks such as MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ResNet
variants. To further improve feature learning, we introduced a DCT layer, which
transforms input features into a frequency-based representation, preserving
essential spectral information, decorrelating features, and enhancing
robustness to noise. This frequency-domain approach, coupled with transfer
learning, is especially beneficial for limited medical datasets, as it
leverages rich representations from pre-trained networks to improve
generalization. By strategically placing the DCT layer at deeper truncation
depths within EfficientNet, our model achieved a best area under the curve
(AUC) of 72.88%, demonstrating the effectiveness of frequency-domain feature
extraction and transfer learning in predicting hypertension risk in OSA
patients over a five-year period.

Conclusion: PPC方法通过3D透视调整优化构图，解决了传统方法的局限性，并提供了实用的数据集和评估工具。

Abstract: Traditional photography composition approaches are dominated by 2D
cropping-based methods. However, these methods fall short when scenes contain
poorly arranged subjects. Professional photographers often employ perspective
adjustment as a form of 3D recomposition, modifying the projected 2D
relationships between subjects while maintaining their actual spatial positions
to achieve better compositional balance. Inspired by this artistic practice, we
propose photography perspective composition (PPC), extending beyond traditional
cropping-based methods. However, implementing the PPC faces significant
challenges: the scarcity of perspective transformation datasets and undefined
assessment criteria for perspective quality. To address these challenges, we
present three key contributions: (1) An automated framework for building PPC
datasets through expert photographs. (2) A video generation approach that
demonstrates the transformation process from suboptimal to optimal
perspectives. (3) A perspective quality assessment (PQA) model constructed
based on human performance. Our approach is concise and requires no additional
prompt instructions or camera trajectories, helping and guiding ordinary users
to enhance their composition skills.

Result: 实验表明，ProBA在挑战性现实条件下优于传统方法，减少了陷入局部极小的可能性。

Conclusion: ProBA通过消除对强初始化和已知内参的需求，提升了SLAM系统在非结构化环境中的实用性。

Abstract: Classical Bundle Adjustment (BA) methods require accurate initial estimates
for convergence and typically assume known camera intrinsics, which limits
their applicability when such information is uncertain or unavailable. We
propose a novel probabilistic formulation of BA (ProBA) that explicitly models
and propagates uncertainty in both the 2D observations and the 3D scene
structure, enabling optimization without any prior knowledge of camera poses or
focal length. Our method uses 3D Gaussians instead of point-like landmarks and
we introduce uncertainty-aware reprojection losses by projecting the 3D
Gaussians onto the 2D image space, and enforce geometric consistency across
multiple 3D Gaussians using the Bhattacharyya coefficient to encourage overlap
between their corresponding Gaussian distributions. This probabilistic
framework leads to more robust and reliable optimization, even in the presence
of outliers in the correspondence set, reducing the likelihood of converging to
poor local minima. Experimental results show that \textit{ProBA} outperforms
traditional methods in challenging real-world conditions. By removing the need
for strong initialization and known intrinsics, ProBA enhances the practicality
of SLAM systems deployed in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Retinal imaging has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive modality for
detecting and quantifying biomarkers of systemic diseases-ranging from diabetes
and hypertension to Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disorders but
current insights remain dispersed across platforms and specialties. Recent
technological advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT/OCTA) and adaptive
optics (AO) now deliver ultra-high-resolution scans (down to 5 {\mu}m ) with
superior contrast and spatial integration, allowing early identification of
microvascular abnormalities and neurodegenerative changes. At the same time,
AI-driven and machine learning (ML) algorithms have revolutionized the analysis
of large-scale retinal datasets, increasing sensitivity and specificity; for
example, deep learning models achieve > 90 \% sensitivity for diabetic
retinopathy and AUC = 0.89 for the prediction of cardiovascular risk from
fundus photographs. The proliferation of mobile health technologies and
telemedicine platforms further extends access, reduces costs, and facilitates
community-based screening and longitudinal monitoring. Despite these
breakthroughs, translation into routine practice is hindered by heterogeneous
imaging protocols, limited external validation of AI models, and integration
challenges within clinical workflows. In this review, we systematically
synthesize the latest OCT/OCT and AO developments, AI/ML approaches, and
mHealth/Tele-ophthalmology initiatives and quantify their diagnostic
performance across disease domains. Finally, we propose a roadmap for
multicenter protocol standardization, prospective validation trials, and
seamless incorporation of retinal screening into primary and specialty care
pathways-paving the way for precision prevention, early intervention, and
ongoing treatment of life-threatening systemic diseases.

Abstract: Road potholes pose a serious threat to driving safety and comfort, making
their detection and assessment a critical task in fields such as autonomous
driving. When driving vehicles, the operators usually avoid large potholes and
approach smaller ones at reduced speeds to ensure safety. Therefore, accurately
estimating pothole area is of vital importance. Most existing vision-based
methods rely on distance priors to construct geometric models. However, their
performance is susceptible to variations in camera angles and typically relies
on the assumption of a flat road surface, potentially leading to significant
errors in complex real-world environments. To address these problems, a robust
pothole area estimation framework that integrates object detection and
monocular depth estimation in a video stream is proposed in this paper. First,
to enhance pothole feature extraction and improve the detection of small
potholes, ACSH-YOLOv8 is proposed with ACmix module and the small object
detection head. Then, the BoT-SORT algorithm is utilized for pothole tracking,
while DepthAnything V2 generates depth maps for each frame. With the obtained
depth maps and potholes labels, a novel Minimum Bounding Triangulated Pixel
(MBTP) method is proposed for pothole area estimation. Finally, Kalman Filter
based on Confidence and Distance (CDKF) is developed to maintain consistency of
estimation results across consecutive frames. The results show that ACSH-YOLOv8
model achieves an AP(50) of 76.6%, representing a 7.6% improvement over YOLOv8.
Through CDKF optimization across consecutive frames, pothole predictions become
more robust, thereby enhancing the method's practical applicability.

Result: SCAR在多项任务中表现优于标准RLHF和基于注意力的密集奖励方法，收敛更快且最终奖励更高。

Conclusion: SCAR为RLHF中的信用分配提供了更有效且理论可靠的方法，提升了LLM对齐效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used technique
for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet it often
suffers from sparse reward signals, making effective credit assignment
challenging. In typical setups, the reward model provides a single scalar score
for an entire generated sequence, offering little insight into which token or
span-level decisions were responsible for the outcome. To address this, we
propose Shapley Credit Assignment Rewards (SCAR), a novel method that leverages
Shapley values in cooperative game theory. SCAR distributes the total
sequence-level reward among constituent tokens or text spans based on their
principled marginal contributions. This creates dense reward signals,
crucially, without necessitating the training of auxiliary critique models or
recourse to fine-grained human annotations at intermediate generation stages.
Unlike prior dense reward methods, SCAR offers a game-theoretic foundation for
fair credit attribution. Theoretically, we demonstrate that SCAR preserves the
original optimal policy, and empirically, across diverse tasks including
sentiment control, text summarization, and instruction tuning, we show that
SCAR converges significantly faster and achieves higher final reward scores
compared to standard RLHF and attention-based dense reward baselines. Our
findings suggest that SCAR provides a more effective and theoretically sound
method for credit assignment in RLHF, leading to more efficient alignment of
LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in ranking systems such
as information retrieval (IR) systems and recommender systems (RSs). To
alleviate the latency of auto-regressive decoding, some studies explore the
single (first) token decoding for ranking approximation, but they suffer from
severe degradation in tail positions. Although speculative decoding (SD)
methods can be a remedy with verification at different positions, they face
challenges in ranking systems due to their left-to-right decoding paradigm.
Firstly, ranking systems require strict latency constraints, but verification
rounds in SD methods remain agnostic; Secondly, SD methods usually discard
listwise ranking knowledge about unaccepted items in previous rounds, hindering
future multi-token prediction, especially when candidate tokens are the
unaccepted items. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Speculative
Decoding method for fast ranking inference of LLMs. To meet the ranking
systems' latency requirement, we propose an up-to-down decoding paradigm that
employs an agent to iteratively modify the ranking sequence under a constrained
budget. Specifically, we design a ranking-tailored policy optimization,
actively exploring optimal multi-round ranking modification policy verified by
LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). To better approximate the target LLM
under the constrained budget, we trigger the agent fully utilizing the listwise
ranking knowledge about all items verified by LLMs across different rounds in
RL, enhancing the modification policy of the agent. More importantly, we
demonstrate the theoretical robustness and advantages of our paradigm and
implementation. Experiments on both IR and RS tasks show the effectiveness of
our proposed method.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited the capacity of enhancing
reasoning performance via internal test-time scaling. Building upon this, a
promising direction is to further scale test-time compute to unlock even
greater reasoning capabilities. However, as we push these scaling boundaries,
systematically understanding the practical limits and achieving optimal
resource allocation becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, we investigate
the scaling Pareto of test-time scaling and introduce the Test-Time Scaling
Performance Model (TTSPM). We theoretically analyze two fundamental paradigms
for such extended scaling, parallel scaling and sequential scaling, from a
probabilistic modeling perspective. Our primary contribution is the derivation
of the saturation point on the scaling budget for both strategies, identifying
thresholds beyond which additional computation yields diminishing returns.
Remarkably, despite their distinct mechanisms, both paradigms converge to a
unified mathematical structure in their upper bounds. We empirically validate
our theoretical findings on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH-500, and GPQA, demonstrating the practical utility of these bounds for
test-time resource allocation. We hope that this work provides insights into
the cost-benefit trade-offs of test-time scaling, guiding the development of
more resource-efficient inference strategies for large reasoning models.

Abstract: Complex tasks involving tool integration pose significant challenges for
Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to the emergence of multi-agent workflows
as a promising solution. Reflection has emerged as an effective strategy for
correcting erroneous trajectories in agentic workflows. However, existing
approaches only exploit such capability in the post-action stage, where the
agent observes the execution outcomes. We argue that, like humans, LLMs can
also engage in reflection before action execution: the agent can anticipate
undesirable outcomes from its own decisions, which not only provides a
necessarily complementary perspective to evaluate the decision but also
prevents the propagation of errors throughout the trajectory. In this paper, we
propose MIRROR, a framework that consists of both intra-reflection, which
critically assesses intended actions before execution, and inter-reflection,
which further adjusts the trajectory based on observations. This design
systematically leverages LLM reflection capabilities to eliminate and rectify
erroneous actions on a more comprehensive scope. Evaluations on both the
StableToolBench and TravelPlanner benchmarks demonstrate MIRROR's superior
performance, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to existing
approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL训练中局部最优和长期奖励最大化的问题，避免现有方法（自动策略优化和人工反馈）的高成本和扩展性问题。

Result: 在标准RL基准测试中，该方法优于现有基线，验证了LLM在解决RL训练瓶颈中的有效性。

Conclusion: LLM可以有效地辅助RL训练，提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved notable success in various
domains, training effective policies for complex tasks remains challenging.
Agents often converge to local optima and fail to maximize long-term rewards.
Existing approaches to mitigate training bottlenecks typically fall into two
categories: (i) Automated policy refinement, which identifies critical states
from past trajectories to guide policy updates, but suffers from costly and
uncertain model training; and (ii) Human-in-the-loop refinement, where human
feedback is used to correct agent behavior, but this does not scale well to
environments with large or continuous action spaces. In this work, we design a
large language model-guided policy modulation framework that leverages LLMs to
improve RL training without additional model training or human intervention. We
first prompt an LLM to identify critical states from a sub-optimal agent's
trajectories. Based on these states, the LLM then provides action suggestions
and assigns implicit rewards to guide policy refinement. Experiments across
standard RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based explanations in
addressing RL training bottlenecks.

Result: 在WebShop和InterCode-SQL基准测试中，RRO表现优异且探索成本显著降低。

Conclusion: RRO为LLM代理在多步任务中的高效优化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a
variety of tasks while it remains challenging for them to solve complex
multi-step tasks as agents. In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of
certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle
mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the
reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every
reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models
(PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number
of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire
the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this
issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps
and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for
process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO).
Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until
identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising
rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands
the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing
high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on
the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO
achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated formidable capabilities in
solving mathematical problems, yet they may still commit logical reasoning and
computational errors during the problem-solving process. Thus, this paper
proposes a framework, MATH-VF, which includes a Formalizer and a Critic, for
formally verifying the correctness of the solutions generated by large language
models. Our framework first utilizes a Formalizer which employs an LLM to
translate a natural language solution into a formal context. Afterward, our
Critic (which integrates various external tools such as a Computer Algebra
System and an SMT solver) evaluates the correctness of each statement within
the formal context, and when a statement is incorrect, our Critic provides
corrective feedback. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of MATH-VF in
two scenarios: 1) Verification: MATH-VF is utilized to determine the
correctness of a solution to a given problem. 2) Refinement: When MATH-VF
identifies errors in the solution generated by an LLM-based solution generator
for a given problem, it submits the corrective suggestions proposed by the
Critic to the solution generator to regenerate the solution. We evaluate our
framework on widely used mathematical benchmarks: MATH500 and ProcessBench,
demonstrating the superiority of our approach over existing approaches.

Conclusion: ALIGN框架有效缓解代理与环境的错位问题，且能泛化到不同代理架构和LLM骨干模型。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive reasoning
capabilities in interactive decision-making tasks. These agents interact with
environment through intermediate interfaces, such as predefined action spaces
and interaction rules, which mediate the perception and action. However,
mismatches often happen between the internal expectations of the agent
regarding the influence of its issued actions and the actual state transitions
in the environment, a phenomenon referred to as \textbf{agent-environment
misalignment}. While prior work has invested substantially in improving agent
strategies and environment design, the critical role of the interface still
remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that
agent-environment misalignment poses a significant bottleneck to agent
performance. To mitigate this issue, we propose \textbf{ALIGN}, an
\underline{A}uto-A\underline{l}igned \underline{I}nterface
\underline{G}e\underline{n}eration framework that alleviates the misalignment
by enriching the interface. Specifically, the ALIGN-generated interface
enhances both the static information of the environment and the step-wise
observations returned to the agent. Implemented as a lightweight wrapper, this
interface achieves the alignment without modifying either the agent logic or
the environment code. Experiments across multiple domains including embodied
tasks, web navigation and tool-use, show consistent performance improvements,
with up to a 45.67\% success rate improvement observed in ALFWorld. Meanwhile,
ALIGN-generated interface can generalize across different agent architectures
and LLM backbones without interface regeneration. Code and experimental results

Conclusion: 蒸馏方法在提升推理能力方面优于零强化学习，且成本更低。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has played an important role in improving the
reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Some studies apply RL
directly to \textit{smaller} base models (known as zero-RL) and also achieve
notable progress. However, in this paper, we show that using only 920 examples,
a simple distillation method based on the base model can clearly outperform
zero-RL, which typically requires much more data and computational cost. By
analyzing the token frequency in model outputs, we find that the distilled
model shows more flexible reasoning. It uses anthropomorphic tokens and logical
connectors much more often than the zero-RL model. Further analysis reveals
that distillation enhances the presence of two advanced cognitive behaviors:
Multi-Perspective Thinking or Attempting and Metacognitive Awareness. Frequent
occurrences of these two advanced cognitive behaviors give rise to flexible
reasoning, which is essential for solving complex reasoning problems, while
zero-RL fails to significantly boost the frequency of these behaviors.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence and an
essential capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite the
significant advancement in multimodal reasoning, existing benchmarks fail to
comprehensively evaluate their reasoning abilities due to the lack of explicit
categorization for logical reasoning types and an unclear understanding of
reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce MME-Reasoning, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of MLLMs, which covers all
three types of reasoning (i.e., inductive, deductive, and abductive) in its
questions. We carefully curate the data to ensure that each question
effectively evaluates reasoning ability rather than perceptual skills or
knowledge breadth, and extend the evaluation protocols to cover the evaluation
of diverse questions. Our evaluation reveals substantial limitations of
state-of-the-art MLLMs when subjected to holistic assessments of logical
reasoning capabilities. Even the most advanced MLLMs show limited performance
in comprehensive logical reasoning, with notable performance imbalances across
reasoning types. In addition, we conducted an in-depth analysis of approaches
such as ``thinking mode'' and Rule-based RL, which are commonly believed to
enhance reasoning abilities. These findings highlight the critical limitations
and performance imbalances of current MLLMs in diverse logical reasoning
scenarios, providing comprehensive and systematic insights into the
understanding and evaluation of reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Automating robust hypothesis generation in open environments is pivotal for
AI cognition. We introduce a novel framework integrating a multi-agent system,

vocabulary (predicates) and relational templates , i.e., \emph{language bias}
directly from raw textual data. This automated symbolic grounding (the
construction of the language bias), traditionally an expert-driven bottleneck
for ILP, then guides the transformation of text into facts for an ILP solver,
which inductively learns interpretable rules. This approach overcomes
traditional ILP's reliance on predefined symbolic structures and the
noise-sensitivity of pure LLM methods. Extensive experiments in diverse,
challenging scenarios validate superior performance, paving a new path for
automated, explainable, and verifiable hypothesis generation.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based large language models (LLMs) are
widely used in finance for their excellent performance on knowledge-intensive
tasks. However, standardized documents (e.g., SEC filing) share similar formats
such as repetitive boilerplate texts, and similar table structures. This
similarity forces traditional RAG methods to misidentify near-duplicate text,
leading to duplicate retrieval that undermines accuracy and completeness. To
address these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Retrieval with Evidence
Curation (HiREC) framework. Our approach first performs hierarchical retrieval
to reduce confusion among similar texts. It first retrieve related documents
and then selects the most relevant passages from the documents. The evidence
curation process removes irrelevant passages. When necessary, it automatically
generates complementary queries to collect missing information. To evaluate our
approach, we construct and release a Large-scale Open-domain Financial (LOFin)
question answering benchmark that includes 145,897 SEC documents and 1,595
question-answer pairs. Our code and data are available at

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in healthcare,
ensuring their safety, particularly within collaborative multi-agent

comprising 5 000 adversarial medical prompts spanning 25 threat categories with
100 subthemes. Coupled with this dataset, we develop an end-to-end
attack-defense evaluation pipeline to systematically analyze how four
representative multi-agent topologies (Layers, SharedPool, Centralized, and
Decentralized) withstand attacks from 'dark-personality' agents. Our findings
reveal critical differences in how these architectures handle information
contamination and maintain robust decision-making, exposing their underlying
vulnerability mechanisms. For instance, SharedPool's open information sharing
makes it highly susceptible, whereas Decentralized architectures exhibit
greater resilience thanks to inherent redundancy and isolation. To mitigate
these risks, we propose a personality-scale detection and correction mechanism
that identifies and rehabilitates malicious agents, restoring system safety to
near-baseline levels. MedSentry thus furnishes both a rigorous evaluation
framework and practical defense strategies that guide the design of safer
LLM-based multi-agent systems in medical domains.

Conclusion: 系统提示分析应纳入AI审计流程，以防止潜在危害。

Abstract: System prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs) are predefined directives that
guide model behaviour, taking precedence over user inputs in text processing
and generation. LLM deployers increasingly use them to ensure consistent
responses across contexts. While model providers set a foundation of system
prompts, deployers and third-party developers can append additional prompts
without visibility into others' additions, while this layered implementation
remains entirely hidden from end-users. As system prompts become more complex,
they can directly or indirectly introduce unaccounted for side effects. This
lack of transparency raises fundamental questions about how the position of
information in different directives shapes model outputs. As such, this work
examines how the placement of information affects model behaviour. To this end,
we compare how models process demographic information in system versus user
prompts across six commercially available LLMs and 50 demographic groups. Our
analysis reveals significant biases, manifesting in differences in user
representation and decision-making scenarios. Since these variations stem from
inaccessible and opaque system-level configurations, they risk
representational, allocative and potential other biases and downstream harms
beyond the user's ability to detect or correct. Our findings draw attention to
these critical issues, which have the potential to perpetuate harms if left
unexamined. Further, we argue that system prompt analysis must be incorporated
into AI auditing processes, particularly as customisable system prompts become
increasingly prevalent in commercial AI deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite advanced general capabilities, still
suffer from numerous safety risks, especially jailbreak attacks that bypass
safety protocols. Understanding these vulnerabilities through black-box
jailbreak attacks, which better reflect real-world scenarios, offers critical
insights into model robustness. While existing methods have shown improvements
through various prompt engineering techniques, their success remains limited
against safety-aligned models, overlooking a more fundamental problem: the
effectiveness is inherently bounded by the predefined strategy spaces. However,
expanding this space presents significant challenges in both systematically
capturing essential attack patterns and efficiently navigating the increased
complexity. To better explore the potential of expanding the strategy space, we
address these challenges through a novel framework that decomposes jailbreak
strategies into essential components based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model
(ELM) theory and develops genetic-based optimization with intention evaluation
mechanisms. To be striking, our experiments reveal unprecedented jailbreak
capabilities by expanding the strategy space: we achieve over 90% success rate
on Claude-3.5 where prior methods completely fail, while demonstrating strong
cross-model transferability and surpassing specialized safeguard models in
evaluation accuracy. The code is open-sourced at:

Consequently, an AI must predict the rest of our seemingly complex values from

I argue that human values have a generative rational structure and that this
allows us to solve the value generalization problem. In particular, we can use
Bayesian Theory of Mind models to infer human values not only from behaviour,
but also from other values. This has been obscured by the widespread use of
simple utility functions to represent human values. I conclude that developing

Abstract: LLM-based agent systems are emerging as a new software paradigm and have been
widely adopted across diverse domains such as medicine, robotics, and
programming. However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as
they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing
external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e.,
bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While
recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in
addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how
effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ
significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually
analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent
issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a
reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an
executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate
state-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited
effectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results
underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to
traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop
advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues. Data and code are available at

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal tasks, yet they also exhibit notable social biases. These biases
often manifest as unintended associations between neutral concepts and
sensitive human attributes, leading to disparate model behaviors across
demographic groups. While existing studies primarily focus on detecting and
quantifying such biases, they offer limited insight into the underlying
mechanisms within the models. To address this gap, we propose an explanatory
framework that combines information flow analysis with multi-round dialogue
evaluation, aiming to understand the origin of social bias from the perspective
of imbalanced internal information utilization. Specifically, we first identify
high-contribution image tokens involved in the model's reasoning process for
neutral questions via information flow analysis. Then, we design a multi-turn
dialogue mechanism to evaluate the extent to which these key tokens encode
sensitive information. Extensive experiments reveal that LVLMs exhibit
systematic disparities in information usage when processing images of different
demographic groups, suggesting that social bias is deeply rooted in the model's
internal reasoning dynamics. Furthermore, we complement our findings from a
textual modality perspective, showing that the model's semantic representations
already display biased proximity patterns, thereby offering a cross-modal
explanation of bias formation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diagnostic framework that integrates
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support system
diagnostics in high-reliability systems such as nuclear power plants.
Traditional diagnostic modeling struggles when systems become too complex,
making functional modeling a more attractive approach. Our approach introduces
a diagnostic framework grounded in the functional modeling principles of the
Dynamic Master Logic (DML) model. It incorporates two coordinated LLM
components, including an LLM-based workflow for automated construction of DML
logic from system documentation and an LLM agent that facilitates interactive
diagnostics. The generated logic is encoded into a structured KG, referred to
as KG-DML, which supports hierarchical fault reasoning. Expert knowledge or
operational data can also be incorporated to refine the model's precision and
diagnostic depth. In the interaction phase, users submit natural language
queries, which are interpreted by the LLM agent. The agent selects appropriate
tools for structured reasoning, including upward and downward propagation
across the KG-DML. Rather than embedding KG content into every prompt, the LLM
agent distinguishes between diagnostic and interpretive tasks. For diagnostics,
the agent selects and executes external tools that perform structured KG
reasoning. For general queries, a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Graph-RAG) approach is used, retrieving relevant KG segments and embedding
them into the prompt to generate natural explanations. A case study on an
auxiliary feedwater system demonstrated the framework's effectiveness, with
over 90% accuracy in key elements and consistent tool and argument extraction,
supporting its use in safety-critical diagnostics.

Conclusion: ChemCoTBench填补了抽象推理方法与实际化学发现之间的差距，为LLMs作为AI驱动科学创新工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
excel in mathematics and coding, their potential for systematic reasoning in
chemistry, a domain demanding rigorous structural analysis for real-world tasks
like drug design and reaction engineering, remains untapped. Current benchmarks
focus on simple knowledge retrieval, neglecting step-by-step reasoning required
for complex tasks such as molecular optimization and reaction prediction. To
address this, we introduce ChemCoTBench, a reasoning framework that bridges
molecular structure understanding with arithmetic-inspired operations,
including addition, deletion, and substitution, to formalize chemical
problem-solving into transparent, step-by-step workflows. By treating molecular
transformations as modular "chemical operations", the framework enables
slow-thinking reasoning, mirroring the logic of mathematical proofs while
grounding solutions in real-world chemical constraints. We evaluate models on
two high-impact tasks: Molecular Property Optimization and Chemical Reaction
Prediction. These tasks mirror real-world challenges while providing structured
evaluability. By providing annotated datasets, a reasoning taxonomy, and
baseline evaluations, ChemCoTBench bridges the gap between abstract reasoning
methods and practical chemical discovery, establishing a foundation for
advancing LLMs as tools for AI-driven scientific innovation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize how we
design and implement compilers and code translation tools. However, existing
LLMs struggle to handle long and complex programs. We introduce LEGO-Compiler,
a novel neural compilation system that leverages LLMs to translate high-level
languages into assembly code. Our approach centers on three key innovations:
LEGO translation, which decomposes the input program into manageable blocks;
breaking down the complex compilation process into smaller, simpler verifiable
steps by organizing it as a verifiable LLM workflow by external tests; and a
feedback mechanism for self-correction. Supported by formal proofs of
translation composability, LEGO-Compiler demonstrates high accuracy on multiple
datasets, including over 99% on ExeBench and 97.9% on industrial-grade
AnsiBench. Additionally, LEGO-Compiler has also acheived near one
order-of-magnitude improvement on compilable code size scalability. This work
opens new avenues for applying LLMs to system-level tasks, complementing
traditional compiler technologies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in various
robot control tasks. However, their deployment in real-world applications
remains constrained. Even state-ofthe-art LLMs, such as GPT-o4mini, frequently
produce invalid action plans that violate physical constraints, such as
directing a robot to an unreachable location or causing collisions between
robots. This issue primarily arises from a lack of awareness of these physical
constraints during the reasoning process. To address this issue, we propose a
novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) to incentivize knowledge of physical constraints into LLMs to induce
constraints-aware reasoning during plan generation. In this approach, only
valid action plans that successfully complete a control task receive positive
rewards. We applied our method to two small-scale LLMs: a non-reasoning
Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and a reasoning Qwen3-4B. The experiment results
demonstrate that constraint-aware small LLMs largely outperform large-scale
models without constraints, grounded on both the BoxNet task and a newly
developed BoxNet3D environment built using MuJoCo. This work highlights the
effectiveness of grounding even small LLMs with physical constraints to enable
scalable and efficient multi-robot control in complex, physically constrained
environments.

Conclusion: SWE-Judge是一种可扩展且可靠的替代人工评估的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been
increasingly used to support software developers by generating software
artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately
assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant
challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is
labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, other existing
automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but
they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated
software artifacts.
  In this paper, we present SWE-Judge, the first evaluation metric for
LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the
correctness of generated software artifacts. SWE-Judge first defines five
distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented as an independent judge. A
dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of
judges to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate
SWE-Judge across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks,
including CoNaLa, Card2Code, HumanEval-X, APPS, APR-Assess, and Summary-Assess.
These benchmarks span three SE tasks: code generation, automated program
repair, and code summarization. Experimental results demonstrate that SWE-Judge
consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with
improvements ranging from 5.9% to 183.8% over existing automatic metrics.
Furthermore, SWE-Judge reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are
comparable to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair
tasks. These findings underscore SWE-Judge's potential as a scalable and
reliable alternative to human evaluation.

Conclusion: DIMA为多智能体世界模型构建提供了新范式，推动了MARL研究的前沿。

Abstract: World models have recently attracted growing interest in Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) due to their ability to improve sample efficiency
for policy learning. However, accurately modeling environments in MARL is
challenging due to the exponentially large joint action space and highly
uncertain dynamics inherent in multi-agent systems. To address this, we reduce
modeling complexity by shifting from jointly modeling the entire state-action
transition dynamics to focusing on the state space alone at each timestep
through sequential agent modeling. Specifically, our approach enables the model
to progressively resolve uncertainty while capturing the structured
dependencies among agents, providing a more accurate representation of how
agents influence the state. Interestingly, this sequential revelation of
agents' actions in a multi-agent system aligns with the reverse process in
diffusion models--a class of powerful generative models known for their
expressiveness and training stability compared to autoregressive or latent
variable models. Leveraging this insight, we develop a flexible and robust
world model for MARL using diffusion models. Our method, Diffusion-Inspired
Multi-Agent world model (DIMA), achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple multi-agent control benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior
world models in terms of final return and sample efficiency, including MAMuJoCo
and Bi-DexHands. DIMA establishes a new paradigm for constructing multi-agent
world models, advancing the frontier of MARL research.

Abstract: Recent interest in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models (MAS LLMs)
has led to an increase in frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs to tackle complex
tasks. However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS
without engaging with its foundational principles. In this position paper, we
highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs
implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency,
environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring
emergent behaviours. Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent
characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured
environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures. The
field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature
has already addressed. Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and
outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating
established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid
mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.

achieved an accuracy of 80%. The proportion of agreement for the first
differential diagnosis was 0.7. The accuracy of the first and second
differential diagnoses ranged from 70% to 90% for physicians, whereas the AI
interface achieved an accuracy rate of 100%. The average time for the AI
interface (557 sec) was 44.6% shorter than that of the physicians (1006 sec).
The AI interface ($0.08) also reduced costs by 98.1% compared to the
physicians' average ($4.2). Patient satisfaction scores ranged from 4.2 to 4.3
for care by physicians and were 3.9 for the AI interface Conclusion An LLM

ARC Competition, indicative of a significant gap between their performance and
human-level reasoning. In this work, we seek to bridge that gap by introducing
an analogy-inspired ARC dataset, GIFARC. Leveraging large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), we synthesize new ARC-style tasks
from a variety of GIF images that include analogies. Each new task is paired
with ground-truth analogy, providing an explicit mapping between visual
transformations and everyday concepts. By embedding robust human-intuitive
analogies into ARC-style tasks, GIFARC guides AI agents to evaluate the task
analogically before engaging in brute-force pattern search, thus efficiently
reducing problem complexity and build a more concise and human-understandable
solution. We empirically validate that guiding LLM with analogic approach with
GIFARC affects task-solving approaches of LLMs to align with analogic approach

optimization. To address this gap, we introduce MT-Mol, a multi-agent framework

role-specialized LLM agents. Our system incorporates comprehensive RDKit tools,
categorized into five distinct domains: structural descriptors, electronic and
topological features, fragment-based functional groups, molecular
representations, and miscellaneous chemical properties. Each category is
managed by an expert analyst agent, responsible for extracting task-relevant
tools and enabling interpretable, chemically grounded feedback. MT-Mol produces
molecules with tool-aligned and stepwise reasoning through the interaction

simultaneously. Inspired by human motor control, we propose Multi-Resolution
Skill Discovery (MRSD), an HRL framework that learns multiple skill encoders at
different temporal resolutions in parallel. A high-level manager dynamically
selects among these skills, enabling adaptive control strategies over time. We
evaluate MRSD on tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite and show that it
outperforms prior state-of-the-art skill discovery and HRL methods, achieving
faster convergence and higher final performance. Our findings highlight the
benefits of integrating multi-resolution skills in HRL, paving the way for more

Abstract: The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has brought a lot of
attention to their safety alignment. However, existing methods have primarily
focused on model undersafety, where the model responds to hazardous queries,
while neglecting oversafety, where the model refuses to answer safe queries. In
this paper, we introduce the concept of $\textit{safety calibration}$, which
systematically addresses both undersafety and oversafety. Specifically, we
present $\textbf{VSCBench}$, a novel dataset of 3,600 image-text pairs that are
visually or textually similar but differ in terms of safety, which is designed
to evaluate safety calibration across image-centric and text-centric scenarios.
Based on our benchmark, we evaluate safety calibration across eleven widely
used VLMs. Our extensive experiments revealed major issues with both
undersafety and oversafety. We further investigated four approaches to improve
the model's safety calibration. We found that even though some methods
effectively calibrated the models' safety problems, these methods also lead to
the degradation of models' utility. This trade-off underscores the urgent need
for advanced calibration methods, and our benchmark provides a valuable tool
for evaluating future approaches. Our code and data are available at

emphasizing the need for predictive scaling laws, autonomous long-term

Method: 通过系统比较LLMs和MF模型，并引入RAG方法，将LLMs的预测基于结构化交互数据。

Result: 当前LLMs在捕捉协作模式上不如MF模型，但RAG方法显著提升了推荐质量。

Conclusion: RAG方法为基于LLMs的推荐系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: User-item interactions contain rich collaborative signals that form the
backbone of many successful recommender systems. While recent work has explored
the use of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, it remains unclear
whether LLMs can effectively reason over this type of collaborative
information. In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between LLMs and
classical matrix factorization (MF) models to assess LLMs' ability to leverage
user-item interaction data. We further introduce a simple retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) method that enhances LLMs by grounding their predictions in
structured interaction data. Our experiments reveal that current LLMs often
fall short in capturing collaborative patterns inherent to MF models, but that
our RAG-based approach substantially improves recommendation
quality-highlighting a promising direction for future LLM-based recommenders.

Conclusion: Hume展示了价值引导思维在机器人控制中的有效性，为类人思维能力的实现提供了新方向。

Abstract: Humans practice slow thinking before performing actual actions when handling
complex tasks in the physical world. This thinking paradigm, recently, has
achieved remarkable advancement in boosting Large Language Models (LLMs) to
solve complex tasks in digital domains. However, the potential of slow thinking
remains largely unexplored for robotic foundation models interacting with the
physical world. In this work, we propose Hume: a dual-system
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with value-guided System-2 thinking and
cascaded action denoising, exploring human-like thinking capabilities of
Vision-Language-Action models for dexterous robot control. System 2 of Hume
implements value-Guided thinking by extending a Vision-Language-Action Model
backbone with a novel value-query head to estimate the state-action value of
predicted actions. The value-guided thinking is conducted by repeat sampling
multiple action candidates and selecting one according to state-action value.
System 1 of Hume is a lightweight reactive visuomotor policy that takes System
2 selected action and performs cascaded action denoising for dexterous robot
control. At deployment time, System 2 performs value-guided thinking at a low
frequency while System 1 asynchronously receives the System 2 selected action
candidate and predicts fluid actions in real time. We show that Hume
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models across
multiple simulation benchmark and real-robot deployments.

Motivation: 随着LLM在代码生成中的应用增加，研究其生成的代码的能源效率和环境影响，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 通过比较878个LeetCode编程问题的LLM生成代码与人类编写的规范解决方案，评估其能源效率。

Result: LLM生成的代码在能源效率上普遍低于人类代码，某些算法类别差距可达450倍。DeepSeek-v3和GPT-4o表现相对较好。

Conclusion: LLM生成的代码在能源效率上仍需改进，尤其是在动态规划等算法类别中。

Abstract: As the quality of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) improves,
their adoption in the software industry for automated code generation continues
to grow. Researchers primarily focus on enhancing the functional correctness of
the generated code while commonly overlooking its energy efficiency and
environmental impact. This paper investigates the energy efficiency of the code
generated by 20 popular LLMs for 878 programming problems of varying difficulty
levels and diverse algorithmic categories selected from the LeetCode platform
by comparing them against canonical human-written solutions. Although LLMs can
produce functionally correct results in most cases, our findings show that the
performance and energy efficiency of LLM-produced solutions are often far below
those of human-written solutions. Among the studied LLMs, DeepSeek-v3 and
GPT-4o generate the most energy-efficient code, whereas Grok-2 and
Gemini-1.5-Pro are among the least energy-efficient models. On average,
human-generated canonical solutions are approximately 1.17 times more energy
efficient than DeepSeek-v3, 1.21 times more energy efficient than GPT-4o, and
over 2 times more energy efficient than Grok-2 and Gemini-1.5-Pro. For specific
algorithmic groups such as dynamic programming, backtracking, and bit
manipulation, LLM-generated code can consume up to 450 times more energy than
human-generated canonical solutions.

Abstract: Meta-analysis is a systematic research methodology that synthesizes data from
multiple existing studies to derive comprehensive conclusions. This approach
not only mitigates limitations inherent in individual studies but also
facilitates novel discoveries through integrated data analysis. Traditional
meta-analysis involves a complex multi-stage pipeline including literature
retrieval, paper screening, and data extraction, which demands substantial
human effort and time. However, while LLM-based methods can accelerate certain
stages, they still face significant challenges, such as hallucinations in paper
screening and data extraction. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system,
Manalyzer, which achieves end-to-end automated meta-analysis through tool
calls. The hybrid review, hierarchical extraction, self-proving, and feedback
checking strategies implemented in Manalyzer significantly alleviate these two
hallucinations. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of meta-analysis,
we construct a new benchmark comprising 729 papers across 3 domains,
encompassing text, image, and table modalities, with over 10,000 data points.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Manalyzer achieves significant
performance improvements over the LLM baseline in multi meta-analysis tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge representation and reasoning in neural networks have been a
long-standing endeavor which has attracted much attention recently. The
principled integration of reasoning and learning in neural networks is a main
objective of the area of neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this
chapter, a simple energy-based neurosymbolic AI system is described that can
represent and reason formally about any propositional logic formula. This
creates a powerful combination of learning from data and knowledge and logical
reasoning. We start by positioning neurosymbolic AI in the context of the
current AI landscape that is unsurprisingly dominated by Large Language Models
(LLMs). We identify important challenges of data efficiency, fairness and
safety of LLMs that might be addressed by neurosymbolic reasoning systems with
formal reasoning capabilities. We then discuss the representation of logic by
the specific energy-based system, including illustrative examples and empirical
evaluation of the correspondence between logical reasoning and energy
minimization using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). Learning from data and
knowledge is also evaluated empirically and compared with a symbolic, neural
and a neurosymbolic system. Results reported in this chapter in an accessible
way are expected to reignite the research on the use of neural networks as
massively-parallel models for logical reasoning and promote the principled
integration of reasoning and learning in deep networks. We conclude the chapter
with a discussion of the importance of positioning neurosymbolic AI within a
broader framework of formal reasoning and accountability in AI, discussing the
challenges for neurosynbolic AI to tackle the various known problems of
reliability of deep learning.

Abstract: This paper presents Project Riley, a novel multimodal and multi-model
conversational AI architecture oriented towards the simulation of reasoning
influenced by emotional states. Drawing inspiration from Pixar's Inside Out,
the system comprises five distinct emotional agents - Joy, Sadness, Fear,
Anger, and Disgust - that engage in structured multi-round dialogues to
generate, criticise, and iteratively refine responses. A final reasoning
mechanism synthesises the contributions of these agents into a coherent output
that either reflects the dominant emotion or integrates multiple perspectives.
The architecture incorporates both textual and visual large language models
(LLMs), alongside advanced reasoning and self-refinement processes. A
functional prototype was deployed locally in an offline environment, optimised
for emotional expressiveness and computational efficiency. From this initial
prototype, another one emerged, called Armando, which was developed for use in
emergency contexts, delivering emotionally calibrated and factually accurate
information through the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
cumulative context tracking. The Project Riley prototype was evaluated through
user testing, in which participants interacted with the chatbot and completed a
structured questionnaire assessing three dimensions: Emotional Appropriateness,
Clarity and Utility, and Naturalness and Human-likeness. The results indicate
strong performance in structured scenarios, particularly with respect to
emotional alignment and communicative clarity.

Conclusion: AutoReproduce有效提升实验复现的自动化和准确性。

Abstract: Efficient experiment reproduction is critical to accelerating progress in
artificial intelligence. However, the inherent complexity of method design and
training procedures presents substantial challenges for automation. Notably,
reproducing experiments often requires implicit domain-specific knowledge not
explicitly documented in the original papers. To address this, we introduce the
paper lineage algorithm, which identifies and extracts implicit knowledge from
the relevant references cited by the target paper. Building on this idea, we
propose AutoReproduce, a multi-agent framework capable of automatically
reproducing experiments described in research papers in an end-to-end manner.
AutoReproduce enhances code executability by generating unit tests alongside
the reproduction process. To evaluate the reproduction capability, we construct
ReproduceBench, a benchmark annotated with verified implementations, and
introduce novel evaluation metrics to assess both the reproduction and
execution fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoReproduce
outperforms the existing strong agent baselines on all five evaluation metrics
by a peak margin of over $70\%$. In particular, compared to the official
implementations, AutoReproduce achieves an average performance gap of $22.1\%$
on $89.74\%$ of the executable experiment runs. The code will be available at

Abstract: This paper presents an intelligent work automation approach in the context of
contemporary digital transformation by integrating generative AI and
Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) technologies with an Automation Agent to
realize End-to-End (E2E) automation of corporate financial expense processing
tasks. While traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has proven effective
for repetitive, rule-based simple task automation, it faces limitations in
handling unstructured data, exception management, and complex decision-making.
This study designs and implements a four-stage integrated process comprising
automatic recognition of supporting documents such as receipts via OCR/IDP,
item classification based on a policy-driven database, intelligent exception
handling supported by generative AI (large language models, LLMs), and
human-in-the-loop final decision-making with continuous system learning through
an Automation Agent. Applied to a major Korean enterprise (Company S), the
system demonstrated quantitative benefits including over 80% reduction in
processing time for paper receipt expense tasks, decreased error rates, and
improved compliance, as well as qualitative benefits such as enhanced accuracy
and consistency, increased employee satisfaction, and data-driven decision
support. Furthermore, the system embodies a virtuous cycle by learning from
human judgments to progressively improve automatic exception handling
capabilities. Empirically, this research confirms that the organic integration
of generative AI, IDP, and Automation Agents effectively overcomes the
limitations of conventional automation and enables E2E automation of complex
corporate processes. The study also discusses potential extensions to other
domains such as accounting, human resources, and procurement, and proposes
future directions for AI-driven hyper-automation development.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
unlocked new opportunities to tackle complex scientific challenges. Despite
this progress, their application in addressing earth science problems,
especially at the graduate level, remains underexplored. A significant barrier
is the absence of benchmarks that capture the depth and contextual complexity
of geoscientific reasoning. Current benchmarks often rely on synthetic datasets
or simplistic figure-caption pairs, which do not adequately reflect the
intricate reasoning and domain-specific insights required for real-world
scientific applications. To address these gaps, we introduce MSEarth, a
multimodal scientific benchmark curated from high-quality, open-access
scientific publications. MSEarth encompasses the five major spheres of Earth
science: atmosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere,
featuring over 7K figures with refined captions. These captions are crafted
from the original figure captions and enriched with discussions and reasoning
from the papers, ensuring the benchmark captures the nuanced reasoning and
knowledge-intensive content essential for advanced scientific tasks. MSEarth
supports a variety of tasks, including scientific figure captioning, multiple
choice questions, and open-ended reasoning challenges. By bridging the gap in
graduate-level benchmarks, MSEarth provides a scalable and high-fidelity
resource to enhance the development and evaluation of MLLMs in scientific
reasoning. The benchmark is publicly available to foster further research and

Abstract: Low-Altitude Economic Networking (LAENet) aims to support diverse flying
applications below 1,000 meters by deploying various aerial vehicles for
flexible and cost-effective aerial networking. However, complex
decision-making, resource constraints, and environmental uncertainty pose
significant challenges to the development of the LAENet. Reinforcement learning
(RL) offers a potential solution in response to these challenges but has
limitations in generalization, reward design, and model stability. The
emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for RL to
mitigate these limitations. In this paper, we first present a tutorial about
integrating LLMs into RL by using the capacities of generation, contextual
understanding, and structured reasoning of LLMs. We then propose an
LLM-enhanced RL framework for the LAENet in terms of serving the LLM as
information processor, reward designer, decision-maker, and generator.
Moreover, we conduct a case study by using LLMs to design a reward function to
improve the learning performance of RL in the LAENet. Finally, we provide a
conclusion and discuss future work.

Conclusion: 嵌套k-DNF是一种有潜力的可解释性模型，可作为决策树的替代方案。

Abstract: A classifier is considered interpretable if each of its decisions has an
explanation which is small enough to be easily understood by a human user. A
DNF formula can be seen as a binary classifier $\kappa$ over boolean domains.
The size of an explanation of a positive decision taken by a DNF $\kappa$ is
bounded by the size of the terms in $\kappa$, since we can explain a positive
decision by giving a term of $\kappa$ that evaluates to true. Since both
positive and negative decisions must be explained, we consider that
interpretable DNFs are those $\kappa$ for which both $\kappa$ and
$\overline{\kappa}$ can be expressed as DNFs composed of terms of bounded size.
In this paper, we study the family of $k$-DNFs whose complements can also be
expressed as $k$-DNFs. We compare two such families, namely depth-$k$ decision
trees and nested $k$-DNFs, a novel family of models. Experiments indicate that
nested $k$-DNFs are an interesting alternative to decision trees in terms of
interpretability and accuracy.

Abstract: Many state-of-the-art AI models deployed in cyber-physical systems (CPS),
while highly accurate, are simply pattern-matchers.~With limited security
guarantees, there are concerns for their reliability in safety-critical and
contested domains. To advance assured AI, we advocate for a paradigm shift that
imbues data-driven perception models with symbolic structure, inspired by a
human's ability to reason over low-level features and high-level context. We
propose a neuro-symbolic paradigm for perception (NeuSPaPer) and illustrate how
joint object detection and scene graph generation (SGG) yields deep scene
understanding.~Powered by foundation models for offline knowledge extraction
and specialized SGG algorithms for real-time deployment, we design a framework
leveraging structured relational graphs that ensures the integrity of
situational awareness in autonomy. Using physics-based simulators and
real-world datasets, we demonstrate how SGG bridges the gap between low-level
sensor perception and high-level reasoning, establishing a foundation for
resilient, context-aware AI and advancing trusted autonomy in CPS.

Abstract: Early-stage startup investment is a high-risk endeavor characterized by
scarce data and uncertain outcomes. Traditional machine learning approaches
often require large, labeled datasets and extensive fine-tuning, yet remain
opaque and difficult for domain experts to interpret or improve. In this paper,
we propose a transparent and data-efficient investment decision framework
powered by memory-augmented large language models (LLMs) using in-context
learning (ICL). Central to our method is a natural language policy embedded
directly into the LLM prompt, enabling the model to apply explicit reasoning
patterns and allowing human experts to easily interpret, audit, and iteratively
refine the logic. We introduce a lightweight training process that combines
few-shot learning with an in-context learning loop, enabling the LLM to update
its decision policy iteratively based on structured feedback. With only minimal
supervision and no gradient-based optimization, our system predicts startup
success far more accurately than existing benchmarks. It is over 20x more
precise than random chance, which succeeds 1.9% of the time. It is also 7.1x
more precise than the typical 5.6% success rate of top-tier venture capital

Abstract: During job recruitment, traditional applicant selection methods often lack
transparency. Candidates are rarely given sufficient justifications for
recruiting decisions, whether they are made manually by human recruiters or
through the use of black-box Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). To address this
problem, our work introduces a multi-agent AI system that uses Large Language

iterative user-centric design approach, we first conducted a two-phased
exploratory study with four active job seekers to inform the design and
development of the system. Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth, qualitative
user study with 20 active job seekers through individual one-to-one interviews
to evaluate the developed prototype. The results of our evaluation demonstrate
that participants perceived our multi-agent recruitment system as significantly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLM在不同文化背景下的内部偏见，填补了对其文化差异编码理解的空白。

Method: 设计了三个检索任务（种族与国家、个人特征与国家、身体特征与国家），系统评估VLM的偏见。

Result: 发现VLM中存在持续性偏见，视觉表征可能无意中强化社会刻板印象。

Conclusion: 强调了理解并解决VLM中文化偏见的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse cultural
contexts, yet their internal biases remain poorly understood. In this work, we
propose a novel framework to systematically evaluate how VLMs encode cultural
differences and biases related to race, gender, and physical traits across
countries. We introduce three retrieval-based tasks: (1) Race to Country
retrieval, which examines the association between individuals from specific
racial groups (East Asian, White, Middle Eastern, Latino, South Asian, and
Black) and different countries; (2) Personal Traits to Country retrieval, where
images are paired with trait-based prompts (e.g., Smart, Honest, Criminal,
Violent) to investigate potential stereotypical associations; and (3) Physical
Characteristics to Country retrieval, focusing on visual attributes like
skinny, young, obese, and old to explore how physical appearances are
culturally linked to nations. Our findings reveal persistent biases in VLMs,
highlighting how visual representations may inadvertently reinforce societal
stereotypes.

Abstract: Accurate ECG interpretation is vital, yet complex cardiac data and
"black-box" AI models limit clinical utility. Inspired by Transformer
architectures' success in NLP for understanding sequential data, we frame ECG
as the heart's unique "language" of temporal patterns. We present
CardioPatternFormer, a novel Transformer-based model for interpretable ECG
classification. It employs a sophisticated attention mechanism to precisely
identify and classify diverse cardiac patterns, excelling at discerning subtle
anomalies and distinguishing multiple co-occurring conditions. This
pattern-guided attention provides clear insights by highlighting influential
signal regions, effectively allowing the "heart to talk" through transparent
interpretations. CardioPatternFormer demonstrates robust performance on
challenging ECGs, including complex multi-pathology cases. Its interpretability
via attention maps enables clinicians to understand the model's rationale,
fostering trust and aiding informed diagnostic decisions. This work offers a
powerful, transparent solution for advanced ECG analysis, paving the way for
more reliable and clinically actionable AI in cardiology.

Motivation: T2I模型在生成内容时可能放大社会刻板印象，引发伦理问题，因此需要系统评估和减少这些偏见。

Method: 提出SSI指标和偏见检测框架，审计三大T2I模型输出，并通过LLM优化提示进行去偏。

Result: 提示优化显著降低SSI（地理文化降61%，职业降69%，形容词降51%），但用户认为去偏可能影响上下文对齐。

Conclusion: 需平衡去偏与上下文相关性，设计支持多样性的T2I系统。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled visual content creation through
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, despite their creative potential, T2I
models often replicate and amplify societal stereotypes -- particularly those
related to gender, race, and culture -- raising important ethical concerns.
This paper proposes a theory-driven bias detection rubric and a Social
Stereotype Index (SSI) to systematically evaluate social biases in T2I outputs.
We audited three major T2I model outputs -- DALL-E-3, Midjourney-6.1, and
Stability AI Core -- using 100 queries across three categories -- geocultural,
occupational, and adjectival. Our analysis reveals that initial outputs are
prone to include stereotypical visual cues, including gendered professions,
cultural markers, and western beauty norms. To address this, we adopted our
rubric to conduct targeted prompt refinement using LLMs, which significantly
reduced bias -- SSI dropped by 61% for geocultural, 69% for occupational, and
51% for adjectival queries. We complemented our quantitative analysis through a
user study examining perceptions, awareness, and preferences around
AI-generated biased imagery. Our findings reveal a key tension -- although
prompt refinement can mitigate stereotypes, it can limit contextual alignment.
Interestingly, users often perceived stereotypical images to be more aligned
with their expectations. We discuss the need to balance ethical debiasing with
contextual relevance and call for T2I systems that support global diversity and
inclusivity while not compromising the reflection of real-world social
complexity.

Result: SOFT显著提升了推荐准确性（平均37.59%）。

Conclusion: SOFT方法有效解决了LLM在推荐系统中的性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed extensive exploration of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on the field of Recommender Systems (RS). There are currently two
commonly used strategies to enable LLMs to have recommendation capabilities: 1)
The "Guidance-Only" strategy uses in-context learning to exploit and amplify
the inherent semantic understanding and item recommendation capabilities of
LLMs; 2) The "Tuning-Only" strategy uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
fine-tune LLMs with the aim of fitting them to real recommendation data.
However, neither of these strategies can effectively bridge the gap between the
knowledge space of LLMs and recommendation, and their performance do not meet
our expectations.
  To better enable LLMs to learn recommendation knowledge, we combine the
advantages of the above two strategies and proposed a novel "Guidance+Tuning"
method called Self-Optimized Fine-Tuning (SOFT), which adopts the idea of
curriculum learning. It first employs self-distillation to construct an
auxiliary easy-to-learn but meaningful dataset from a fine-tuned LLM. Then it
further utilizes a self-adaptive curriculum scheduler to enable LLMs to
gradually learn from simpler data (self-distilled data) to more challenging
data (real RS data). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOFT significantly
enhances the recommendation accuracy (37.59\% on average) of LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification is highly challenging in network security
due to the need for extracting robust features from content-agnostic traffic
data. Existing approaches face critical issues: (i) Distribution drift, caused
by reliance on the closedworld assumption, limits adaptability to realworld,
shifting patterns; (ii) Dependence on labeled data restricts applicability
where such data is scarce or unavailable. Large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable potential in offering generalizable solutions across a
wide range of tasks, achieving notable success in various specialized fields.
However, their effectiveness in traffic analysis remains constrained by
challenges in adapting to the unique requirements of the traffic domain. In
this paper, we introduce a novel traffic representation model named Encrypted
Traffic Out-of-Distribution Instruction Tuning with LLM (ETooL), which
integrates LLMs with knowledge of traffic structures through a self-supervised
instruction tuning paradigm. This framework establishes connections between
textual information and traffic interactions. ETooL demonstrates more robust
classification performance and superior generalization in both supervised and
zero-shot traffic classification tasks. Notably, it achieves significant
improvements in F1 scores: APP53 (I.I.D.) to 93.19%(6.62%) and 92.11%(4.19%),
APP53 (O.O.D.) to 74.88%(18.17%) and 72.13%(15.15%), and ISCX-Botnet (O.O.D.)
to 95.03%(9.16%) and 81.95%(12.08%). Additionally, we construct NETD, a traffic
dataset designed to support dynamic distributional shifts, and use it to
validate ETooL's effectiveness under varying distributional conditions.
Furthermore, we evaluate the efficiency gains achieved through ETooL's
instruction tuning approach.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural

development. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages an
FM-powered multi-agent system called AlignMind to address this issue. By having

This allows our solution to iteratively clarify the beliefs, desires, and
intentions of stakeholders, translating these into a set of refined
requirements and a corresponding actionable natural language workflow in the
often-overlooked requirements refinement phase of software engineering, which
is crucial after initial elicitation. Through a multifaceted evaluation

potential for significant improvements in the software development process

Conclusion: HSM-TSS框架有效解决了跨模态学习和语义分离的挑战。

Abstract: Target audio source separation with natural language queries presents a
promising paradigm for extracting arbitrary audio events through arbitrary text
descriptions. Existing methods mainly face two challenges, the difficulty in
jointly modeling acoustic-textual alignment and semantic-aware separation
within a blindly-learned single-stage architecture, and the reliance on
large-scale accurately-labeled training data to compensate for inefficient
cross-modal learning and separation. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical decomposition framework, HSM-TSS, that decouples the task into
global-local semantic-guided feature separation and structure-preserving
acoustic reconstruction. Our approach introduces a dual-stage mechanism for
semantic separation, operating on distinct global and local semantic feature
spaces. We first perform global-semantic separation through a global semantic
feature space aligned with text queries. A Q-Audio architecture is employed to
align audio and text modalities, serving as pretrained global-semantic
encoders. Conditioned on the predicted global feature, we then perform the
second-stage local-semantic separation on AudioMAE features that preserve
time-frequency structures, followed by acoustic reconstruction. We also propose
an instruction processing pipeline to parse arbitrary text queries into
structured operations, extraction or removal, coupled with audio descriptions,
enabling flexible sound manipulation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
separation performance with data-efficient training while maintaining superior
semantic consistency with queries in complex auditory scenes.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, process systems
engineering must adapt to digital transformation. While reinforcement learning
offers a model-free approach to process control, its applications are limited
by the dependence on accurate digital twins and well-designed reward functions.
To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework that
integrates inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) with multi-task learning for
data-driven, multi-mode control design. Using historical closed-loop data as
expert demonstrations, IRL extracts optimal reward functions and control
policies. A latent-context variable is incorporated to distinguish modes,
enabling the training of mode-specific controllers. Case studies on a
continuous stirred tank reactor and a fed-batch bioreactor validate the
effectiveness of this framework in handling multi-mode data and training
adaptable controllers.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have spurred increased
interest in Device-Control Agents (DC agents), such as utilizing in-the-wild
device control to manage graphical user interfaces. Conventional methods for
assessing the capabilities of DC agents, such as computing step-wise action
accuracy and overall task success rates, provide a macroscopic view of DC
agents' performance; however, they fail to offer microscopic insights into
potential errors that may occur in real-world applications. Conducting a
finer-grained performance evaluation of DC agents presents significant
challenges. This study introduces a new perspective on evaluation methods for
DC agents by proposing the XBOUND evaluation method, which employs the
calculation of a novel Explore Metric to delineate the capability boundaries of
DC agents. Compared to previous evaluation methods, XBOUND focuses on
individual states to assess the proficiency of DC agents in mastering these
states. Furthermore, we have developed a ``pseudo'' episode tree dataset
derived from Android Control test data. Utilizing this dataset and XBOUND, we
comprehensively evaluate the OS-Atlas and UI-TARS series, examining both the
overall and specific performance across five common tasks. Additionally, we
select representative cases to highlight the current deficiencies and

Abstract: Personalized programming tutoring, such as exercise recommendation, can
enhance learners' efficiency, motivation, and outcomes, which is increasingly
important in modern digital education. However, the lack of sufficient and
high-quality programming data, combined with the mismatch between offline
evaluation and real-world learning, hinders the practical deployment of such
systems. To address this challenge, many approaches attempt to simulate learner
practice data, yet they often overlook the fine-grained, iterative nature of
programming learning, resulting in a lack of interpretability and granularity.
To fill this gap, we propose a LLM-based agent, CoderAgent, to simulate
students' programming processes in a fine-grained manner without relying on
real data. Specifically, we equip each human learner with an intelligent agent,
the core of which lies in capturing the cognitive states of the human
programming practice process. Inspired by ACT-R, a cognitive architecture
framework, we design the structure of CoderAgent to align with human cognitive
architecture by focusing on the mastery of programming knowledge and the
application of coding ability. Recognizing the inherent patterns in
multi-layered cognitive reasoning, we introduce the Programming Tree of Thought
(PTOT), which breaks down the process into four steps: why, how, where, and
what. This approach enables a detailed analysis of iterative problem-solving
strategies. Finally, experimental evaluations on real-world datasets
demonstrate that CoderAgent provides interpretable insights into learning
trajectories and achieves accurate simulations, paving the way for personalized

consisting of 1,100 carefully curated real-world images with high spatial
complexity. Based on this dataset, we design five tasks to rigorously evaluate
VLMs' spatial perception, structural understanding, and reasoning capabilities,
while deliberately minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge to better
isolate and assess the general spatial reasoning capability. We conduct a
comprehensive evaluation across 24 state-of-the-art VLMs. The results show that
even the strongest model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves only 77.14% overall accuracy
and performs particularly poorly on the Order Generation task, with only 30.00%

Abstract: Abductive reasoning in knowledge graphs aims to generate plausible logical
hypotheses from observed entities, with broad applications in areas such as
clinical diagnosis and scientific discovery. However, due to a lack of
controllability, a single observation may yield numerous plausible but
redundant or irrelevant hypotheses on large-scale knowledge graphs. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of controllable hypothesis generation to
improve the practical utility of abductive reasoning. This task faces two key
challenges when controlling for generating long and complex logical hypotheses:
hypothesis space collapse and hypothesis oversensitivity. To address these
challenges, we propose CtrlHGen, a Controllable logcial Hypothesis Generation
framework for abductive reasoning over knowledge graphs, trained in a two-stage
paradigm including supervised learning and subsequent reinforcement learning.
To mitigate hypothesis space collapse, we design a dataset augmentation
strategy based on sub-logical decomposition, enabling the model to learn
complex logical structures by leveraging semantic patterns in simpler
components. To address hypothesis oversensitivity, we incorporate smoothed
semantic rewards including Dice and Overlap scores, and introduce a
condition-adherence reward to guide the generation toward user-specified
control constraints. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our model not only better adheres to control conditions but
also achieves superior semantic similarity performance compared to baselines.

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) is a pivotal task in legal AI. Existing
semantic-enhanced LJP models integrate judicial precedents and legal knowledge
for high performance. But they neglect legal reasoning logic, a critical
component of legal judgments requiring rigorous logical analysis. Although some
approaches utilize legal reasoning logic for high-quality predictions, their
logic rigidity hinders adaptation to case-specific logical frameworks,
particularly in complex cases that are lengthy and detailed. This paper
proposes a rule-enhanced legal judgment prediction framework based on
first-order logic (FOL) formalism and comparative learning (CL) to develop an
adaptive adjustment mechanism for legal judgment logic and further enhance
performance in LJP. Inspired by the process of human exam preparation, our
method follows a three-stage approach: first, we initialize judgment rules
using the FOL formalism to capture complex reasoning logic accurately; next, we
propose a Confusion-aware Contrastive Learning (CACL) to dynamically optimize
the judgment rules through a quiz consisting of confusable cases; finally, we
utilize the optimized judgment rules to predict legal judgments. Experimental
results on two public datasets show superior performance across all metrics.

Abstract: Younger generations are growing up in a world increasingly shaped by
intelligent technologies, making early AI literacy crucial for developing the
skills to critically understand and navigate them. However, education in this
field often emphasizes tool-based learning, prioritizing usage over
understanding the underlying concepts. This lack of knowledge leaves
non-experts, especially children, prone to misconceptions, unrealistic
expectations, and difficulties in recognizing biases and stereotypes. In this
paper, we propose a structured and replicable teaching approach that fosters
foundational AI literacy in primary students, by building upon core
mathematical elements closely connected to and of interest in primary
curricula, to strengthen conceptualization, data representation, classification
reasoning, and evaluation of AI. To assess the effectiveness of our approach,
we conducted an empirical study with thirty-one fifth-grade students across two
classes, evaluating their progress through a post-test and a satisfaction
survey. Our results indicate improvements in terminology understanding and
usage, features description, logical reasoning, and evaluative skills, with
students showing a deeper comprehension of decision-making processes and their
limitations. Moreover, the approach proved engaging, with students particularly
enjoying activities that linked AI concepts to real-world reasoning. Materials:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ABM中规则不可微分的问题，使其能与梯度优化方法结合，更好地利用真实数据。

Method: 结合扩散模型捕捉行为随机性，图神经网络建模代理交互，直接模拟个体行为而非系统级输出。

Result: 在Schelling隔离模型和捕食者-猎物生态系统中验证了方法，能复制个体模式并准确预测训练外的涌现动态。

Conclusion: 扩散模型与图学习的结合为数据驱动的ABM模拟提供了新思路。

Abstract: Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are powerful tools for studying emergent properties
in complex systems. In ABMs, agent behaviors are governed by local interactions
and stochastic rules. However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable,
limiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus
integration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a
differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method
combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural
networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches,
our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating
system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving
the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our
approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey
ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately
forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training. Our results demonstrate the
potential of combining diffusion models and graph learning for data-driven ABM
simulation.

Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing (AM) involves complex interdependencies among
processes, materials, feedstock, and post-processing steps. However, the
underlying relationships and domain knowledge remain fragmented across
literature and static databases that often demand expert-level queries,
limiting their applicability in design and planning. To address these gaps, we
develop a novel and queryable knowledge graph (KG) in Neo4j, encoding 53
distinct metals and alloys across seven material families, nine AM processes,
four feedstock types, and associated post-processing requirements. A large
language model (LLM) interface, guided by a few-shot prompting strategy,
enables natural language querying without the need for formal query syntax. The
system supports a range of tasks, including compatibility checks,
multi-constraint filtering, and design for AM (DfAM) guidance. User natural
language queries are normalized, translated into Cypher, and executed over the
KG, with results reformatted into structured responses. This work presents the
first real-time, interactive system that integrates a domain-specific metal AM
KG with an LLM interface, offering accessible, explainable decision support for
engineers and advancing human-centric tools in manufacturing intelligence.

Conclusion: EmoCorrector为TSE中的情感一致性提供了有效解决方案，并推动了相关研究。

Abstract: Text-based speech editing (TSE) modifies speech using only text, eliminating
re-recording. However, existing TSE methods, mainly focus on the content
accuracy and acoustic consistency of synthetic speech segments, and often
overlook the emotional shifts or inconsistency issues introduced by text
changes. To address this issue, we propose EmoCorrector, a novel
post-correction scheme for TSE. EmoCorrector leverages Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) by extracting the edited text's emotional features, retrieving
speech samples with matching emotions, and synthesizing speech that aligns with
the desired emotion while preserving the speaker's identity and quality. To
support the training and evaluation of emotional consistency modeling in TSE,
we pioneer the benchmarking Emotion Correction Dataset for TSE (ECD-TSE). The
prominent aspect of ECD-TSE is its inclusion of $<$text, speech$>$ paired data
featuring diverse text variations and a range of emotional expressions.
Subjective and objective experiments and comprehensive analysis on ECD-TSE
confirm that EmoCorrector significantly enhances the expression of intended
emotion while addressing emotion inconsistency limitations in current TSE
methods. Code and audio examples are available at

Abstract: Operating home appliances, among the most common tools in every household, is
a critical capability for assistive home robots. This paper presents ApBot, a
robot system that operates novel household appliances by "reading" their user
manuals. ApBot faces multiple challenges: (i) infer goal-conditioned partial
policies from their unstructured, textual descriptions in a user manual
document, (ii) ground the policies to the appliance in the physical world, and
(iii) execute the policies reliably over potentially many steps, despite
compounding errors. To tackle these challenges, ApBot constructs a structured,
symbolic model of an appliance from its manual, with the help of a large
vision-language model (VLM). It grounds the symbolic actions visually to
control panel elements. Finally, ApBot closes the loop by updating the model
based on visual feedback. Our experiments show that across a wide range of
simulated and real-world appliances, ApBot achieves consistent and
statistically significant improvements in task success rate, compared with
state-of-the-art large VLMs used directly as control policies. These results
suggest that a structured internal representations plays an important role in
robust robot operation of home appliances, especially, complex ones.

Conclusion: InstGenIE通过高效利用掩码稀疏性和优化计算流程，显著提升了扩散模型服务的性能。

Abstract: Generative image editing using diffusion models has become a prevalent
application in today's AI cloud services. In production environments, image
editing typically involves a mask that specifies the regions of an image
template to be edited. The use of masks provides direct control over the
editing process and introduces sparsity in the model inference. In this paper,
we present InstGenIE, a system that efficiently serves image editing requests.
The key insight behind InstGenIE is that image editing only modifies the masked
regions of image templates while preserving the original content in the
unmasked areas. Driven by this insight, InstGenIE judiciously skips redundant
computations associated with the unmasked areas by reusing cached intermediate
activations from previous inferences. To mitigate the high cache loading
overhead, InstGenIE employs a bubble-free pipeline scheme that overlaps
computation with cache loading. Additionally, to reduce queuing latency in
online serving while improving the GPU utilization, InstGenIE proposes a novel
continuous batching strategy for diffusion model serving, allowing newly
arrived requests to join the running batch in just one step of denoising
computation, without waiting for the entire batch to complete. As heterogeneous
masks induce imbalanced loads, InstGenIE also develops a load balancing
strategy that takes into account the loads of both computation and cache
loading. Collectively, InstGenIE outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion serving
systems for image editing, achieving up to 3x higher throughput and reducing
average request latency by up to 14.7x while ensuring image quality.

Abstract: Path planning is a critical component in autonomous drone operations,
enabling safe and efficient navigation through complex environments. Recent
advances in foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhanced
perception and intelligent decision-making in robotics. However, their
practical applicability and effectiveness in global path planning remain
relatively unexplored. This paper proposes foundation model-guided path
planners (FM-Planner) and presents a comprehensive benchmarking study and
practical validation for drone path planning. Specifically, we first
systematically evaluate eight representative LLM and VLM approaches using
standardized simulation scenarios. To enable effective real-time navigation, we
then design an integrated LLM-Vision planner that combines semantic reasoning
with visual perception. Furthermore, we deploy and validate the proposed path
planner through real-world experiments under multiple configurations. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the strengths, limitations, and
feasibility of deploying foundation models in real-world drone applications and
providing practical implementations in autonomous flight. Project site:

Abstract: Although Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have become an integral
part of modern technology, their evaluation remains challenging, particularly
for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper introduces Persian
Speech Recognition Benchmark(PSRB), a comprehensive benchmark designed to
address this gap by incorporating diverse linguistic and acoustic conditions.
We evaluate ten ASR systems, including state-of-the-art commercial and
open-source models, to examine performance variations and inherent biases.
Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Persian ASR transcriptions,
identifying key error types and proposing a novel metric that weights
substitution errors. This metric enhances evaluation robustness by reducing the
impact of minor and partial errors, thereby improving the precision of
performance assessment. Our findings indicate that while ASR models generally
perform well on standard Persian, they struggle with regional accents,
children's speech, and specific linguistic challenges. These results highlight
the necessity of fine-tuning and incorporating diverse, representative training
datasets to mitigate biases and enhance overall ASR performance. PSRB provides
a valuable resource for advancing ASR research in Persian and serves as a
framework for developing benchmarks in other low-resource languages. A subset

Abstract: Current video analytics approaches face a fundamental trade-off between

struggle with long-context processing and incur high computational costs, while
neural-symbolic methods depend heavily on manual labeling and rigid rule
design. In this paper, we introduce LazyVLM, a neuro-symbolic video analytics
system that provides a user-friendly query interface similar to VLMs, while
addressing their scalability limitation. LazyVLM enables users to effortlessly
drop in video data and specify complex multi-frame video queries using a
semi-structured text interface for video analytics. To address the scalability
limitations of VLMs, LazyVLM decomposes multi-frame video queries into
fine-grained operations and offloads the bulk of the processing to efficient
relational query execution and vector similarity search. We demonstrate that
LazyVLM provides a robust, efficient, and user-friendly solution for querying
open-domain video data at scale.

Abstract: Current personalized recommender systems predominantly rely on static offline
data for algorithm design and evaluation, significantly limiting their ability
to capture long-term user preference evolution and social influence dynamics in
real-world scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a
high-fidelity social simulation platform integrating human-like cognitive
agents and dynamic social interactions to realistically simulate user behavior
evolution under recommendation interventions. Specifically, the system
comprises a population of Sim-User Agents, each equipped with a five-layer
cognitive architecture that encapsulates key psychological mechanisms,
including episodic memory, affective state transitions, adaptive preference
learning, and dynamic trust-risk assessments. In particular, we innovatively
introduce the Intimacy--Curiosity--Reciprocity--Risk (ICR2) motivational engine
grounded in psychological and sociological theories, enabling more realistic
user decision-making processes. Furthermore, we construct a multilayer
heterogeneous social graph (GGBond Graph) supporting dynamic relational
evolution, effectively modeling users' evolving social ties and trust dynamics
based on interest similarity, personality alignment, and structural homophily.
During system operation, agents autonomously respond to recommendations
generated by typical recommender algorithms (e.g., Matrix Factorization,
MultVAE, LightGCN), deciding whether to consume, rate, and share content while
dynamically updating their internal states and social connections, thereby
forming a stable, multi-round feedback loop. This innovative design transcends
the limitations of traditional static datasets, providing a controlled,
observable environment for evaluating long-term recommender effects.

Conclusion: 量子AIXI为量子环境下的通用智能提供了理论框架，但受限于量子计算的复杂性和上下文性。

Abstract: AIXI is a widely studied model of artificial general intelligence (AGI) based
upon principles of induction and reinforcement learning. However, AIXI is
fundamentally classical in nature - as are the environments in which it is
modelled. Given the universe is quantum mechanical in nature and the
exponential overhead required to simulate quantum mechanical systems
classically, the question arises as to whether there are quantum mechanical
analogues of AIXI which are theoretically consistent or practically feasible as
models of universal intelligence. To address this question, we extend the
framework to quantum information and present Quantum AIXI (QAIXI). We introduce
a model of quantum agent/environment interaction based upon quantum and
classical registers and channels, showing how quantum AIXI agents may take both
classical and quantum actions. We formulate the key components of AIXI in
quantum information terms, extending previous research on quantum Kolmogorov
complexity and a QAIXI value function. We discuss conditions and limitations
upon quantum Solomonoff induction and show how contextuality fundamentally
affects QAIXI models.

Conclusion: DeSocial展示了基于区块链的多节点验证和个性化算法选择的重要性。

Abstract: Web 2.0 social platforms are inherently centralized, with user data and
algorithmic decisions controlled by the platform. However, users can only
passively receive social predictions without being able to choose the
underlying algorithm, which limits personalization. Fortunately, with the
emergence of blockchain, users are allowed to choose algorithms that are
tailored to their local situation, improving prediction results in a
personalized way. In a blockchain environment, each user possesses its own
model to perform the social prediction, capturing different perspectives on
social interactions. In our work, we propose DeSocial, a decentralized social
network learning framework deployed on an Ethereum (ETH) local development
chain that integrates distributed data storage, node-level consensus, and
user-driven model selection through Ganache. In the first stage, each user
leverages DeSocial to evaluate multiple backbone models on their local
subgraph. DeSocial coordinates the execution and returns model-wise prediction
results, enabling the user to select the most suitable backbone for
personalized social prediction. Then, DeSocial uniformly selects several
validation nodes that possess the algorithm specified by each user, and
aggregates the prediction results by majority voting, to prevent errors caused
by any single model's misjudgment. Extensive experiments show that DeSocial has
an evident improvement compared to the five classical centralized social
network learning models, promoting user empowerment in blockchain-based
decentralized social networks, showing the importance of multi-node validation
and personalized algorithm selection based on blockchain. Our implementation is

Abstract: We propose a principled method for autoencoding with random forests. Our
strategy builds on foundational results from nonparametric statistics and
spectral graph theory to learn a low-dimensional embedding of the model that
optimally represents relationships in the data. We provide exact and
approximate solutions to the decoding problem via constrained optimization,
split relabeling, and nearest neighbors regression. These methods effectively
invert the compression pipeline, establishing a map from the embedding space
back to the input space using splits learned by the ensemble's constituent
trees. The resulting decoders are universally consistent under common
regularity assumptions. The procedure works with supervised or unsupervised
models, providing a window into conditional or joint distributions. We
demonstrate various applications of this autoencoder, including powerful new
tools for visualization, compression, clustering, and denoising. Experiments
illustrate the ease and utility of our method in a wide range of settings,
including tabular, image, and genomic data.

Abstract: Vision-Language Model (VLM) based Web Agents represent a significant step
towards automating complex tasks by simulating human-like interaction with
websites. However, their deployment in uncontrolled web environments introduces
significant security vulnerabilities. Existing research on adversarial
environmental injection attacks often relies on unrealistic assumptions, such
as direct HTML manipulation, knowledge of user intent, or access to agent model
parameters, limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose
AdInject, a novel and real-world black-box attack method that leverages the
internet advertising delivery to inject malicious content into the Web Agent's
environment. AdInject operates under a significantly more realistic threat
model than prior work, assuming a black-box agent, static malicious content
constraints, and no specific knowledge of user intent. AdInject includes
strategies for designing malicious ad content aimed at misleading agents into
clicking, and a VLM-based ad content optimization technique that infers
potential user intents from the target website's context and integrates these
intents into the ad content to make it appear more relevant or critical to the
agent's task, thus enhancing attack effectiveness. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of AdInject, attack success rates exceeding 60%
in most scenarios and approaching 100% in certain cases. This strongly
demonstrates that prevalent advertising delivery constitutes a potent and
real-world vector for environment injection attacks against Web Agents. This
work highlights a critical vulnerability in Web Agent security arising from
real-world environment manipulation channels, underscoring the urgent need for
developing robust defense mechanisms against such threats. Our code is

### [380] [Challenges for artificial cognitive systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20339)
*Antoni Gomila,Vincent C. Müller*

Main category: cs.AI

Relevance: 30.0

TL;DR: 本文旨在填补认知系统研究中的空白，提出明确的目标和挑战，以定义进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知系统研究缺乏明确的目标和挑战来定义进展，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过定义认知系统（即能够从经验中学习并灵活运用知识以实现目标的系统），提出了一系列挑战。

Result: 明确提出了人工认知系统的挑战和目标。

Conclusion: 本文为认知系统研究提供了清晰的方向和衡量标准。

Abstract: The declared goal of this paper is to fill this gap: "... cognitive systems
research needs questions or challenges that define progress. The challenges are
not (yet more) predictions of the future, but a guideline to what are the aims
and what would constitute progress." -- the quotation being from the project
description of EUCogII, the project for the European Network for Cognitive
Systems within which this formulation of the 'challenges' was originally
developed (http://www.eucognition.org). So, we stick out our neck and formulate
the challenges for artificial cognitive systems. These challenges are
articulated in terms of a definition of what a cognitive system is: a system
that learns from experience and uses its acquired knowledge (both declarative
and practical) in a flexible manner to achieve its own goals.

### [381] [Reinforcement Learning-based Sequential Route Recommendation for System-Optimal Traffic Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20889)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于深度强化学习的框架，将静态系统最优交通分配问题转化为单智能体任务，通过推荐个性化路线以最小化总系统旅行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究个性化路线推荐是否能实现系统最优交通分配，以提升整体交通效率。

Method: 采用MSA引导的深度Q学习算法，结合传统交通分配方法的迭代结构。

Result: 在Braess网络中收敛到理论最优解，在OW网络中仅偏离0.35%。

Conclusion: 通过学习型顺序分配，将个体路由行为与系统效率结合，提供了一种理论和实践相关的方法。

Abstract: Modern navigation systems and shared mobility platforms increasingly rely on
personalized route recommendations to improve individual travel experience and
operational efficiency. However, a key question remains: can such sequential,
personalized routing decisions collectively lead to system-optimal (SO) traffic
assignment? This paper addresses this question by proposing a learning-based
framework that reformulates the static SO traffic assignment problem as a
single-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) task. A central agent
sequentially recommends routes to travelers as origin-destination (OD) demands
arrive, to minimize total system travel time. To enhance learning efficiency
and solution quality, we develop an MSA-guided deep Q-learning algorithm that
integrates the iterative structure of traditional traffic assignment methods
into the RL training process. The proposed approach is evaluated on both the
Braess and Ortuzar-Willumsen (OW) networks. Results show that the RL agent
converges to the theoretical SO solution in the Braess network and achieves
only a 0.35% deviation in the OW network. Further ablation studies demonstrate
that the route action set's design significantly impacts convergence speed and
final performance, with SO-informed route sets leading to faster learning and
better outcomes. This work provides a theoretically grounded and practically
relevant approach to bridging individual routing behavior with system-level
efficiency through learning-based sequential assignment.

Conclusion: MetamatBench为超材料发现提供了标准化工具和平台，促进研究与应用。

Abstract: Metamaterials, engineered materials with architected structures across
multiple length scales, offer unprecedented and tunable mechanical properties
that surpass those of conventional materials. However, leveraging advanced
machine learning (ML) for metamaterial discovery is hindered by three
fundamental challenges: (C1) Data Heterogeneity Challenge arises from
heterogeneous data sources, heterogeneous composition scales, and heterogeneous
structure categories; (C2) Model Complexity Challenge stems from the intricate
geometric constraints of ML models, which complicate their adaptation to
metamaterial structures; and (C3) Human-AI Collaboration Challenge comes from
the "dual black-box'' nature of sophisticated ML models and the need for
intuitive user interfaces. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a unified
framework, named MetamatBench, that operates on three levels. (1) At the data
level, we integrate and standardize 5 heterogeneous, multi-modal metamaterial
datasets. (2) The ML level provides a comprehensive toolkit that adapts 17
state-of-the-art ML methods for metamaterial discovery. It also includes a
comprehensive evaluation suite with 12 novel performance metrics with finite
element-based assessments to ensure accurate and reliable model validation. (3)
The user level features a visual-interactive interface that bridges the gap
between complex ML techniques and non-ML researchers, advancing property
prediction and inverse design of metamaterials for research and applications.
MetamatBench offers a unified platform deployed at
http://zhoulab-1.cs.vt.edu:5550 that enables machine learning researchers and
practitioners to develop and evaluate new methodologies in metamaterial
discovery. For accessibility and reproducibility, we open-source our benchmark
and the codebase at https://github.com/cjpcool/Metamaterial-Benchmark.

Result: CRLSM在参数估计和数据拟合上表现良好，而PINN当前配置下表现不佳。

Conclusion: PINN需要进一步优化和超参数调整以提高性能。

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of dynamics in biological systems allows for better
observation and characterization of processes, such as calcium signaling in
cell culture. Recent advancements in techniques allow the exploration of
previously unattainable insights of dynamical systems, such as the Sparse
Identification of Non-Linear Dynamics (SINDy), overcoming the limitations of
more classic methodologies. The latter requires some prior knowledge of an
effective library of candidate terms, which is not realistic for a real case
study. Using inspiration from fields like traffic density estimation and
control theory, we propose a methodology for characterization and performance
analysis of calcium delivery in a family of cells. In this work, we compare the
performance of the Constrained Regularized Least-Squares Method (CRLSM) and
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) for system identification and parameter
discovery for governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The CRLSM
achieves a fairly good parameter estimate and a good data fit when using the
learned parameters in the Consensus problem. On the other hand, despite the
initial hypothesis, PINNs fail to match the CRLSM performance and, under the
current configuration, do not provide fair parameter estimation. However, we
have only studied a limited number of PINN architectures, and it is expected
that additional hyperparameter tuning, as well as uncertainty quantification,
could significantly improve the performance in future works.

Method: 使用真实数据（90户家庭）比较DRL、规则控制和模型预测控制在HEM中的表现。

Result: DRL在电池容量较低时显著提升能源管理和成本节约，而高电池容量时算法控制价值有限。

Conclusion: DRL对有优化潜力的家庭能源管理具有实际价值，有助于电网脱碳。

Abstract: Efficient energy management in prosumer households is key to alleviating grid
stress in an energy transition marked by electric vehicles (EV), renewable
energies and battery storage. However, it is unclear how households optimize
prosumer EV charging. Here we study real-world data from 90 households on
fixed-rate electricity tariffs in German-speaking countries to investigate the
potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and other control approaches
(Rule-Based, Model Predictive Control) to manage the dynamic and uncertain
environment of Home Energy Management (HEM) and optimize household charging
patterns. The DRL agent efficiently aligns charging of EV and battery storage
with photovoltaic (PV) surplus. We find that frequent EV charging transactions,
early EV connections and PV surplus increase optimization potential. A detailed
analysis of nine households (1 hour resolution, 1 year) demonstrates that high
battery capacity facilitates self optimization; in this case further
algorithmic control shows little value. In cases with relatively low battery
capacity, algorithmic control with DRL improves energy management and cost
savings by a relevant margin. This result is further corroborated by our
simulation of a synthetic household. We conclude that prosumer households with
optimization potential would profit from DRL, thus benefiting also the full
electricity system and its decarbonization.

Abstract: Landing safely in crowded urban environments remains an essential yet
challenging endeavor for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), especially in
emergency situations. In this work, we propose a risk-aware approach that
harnesses semantic segmentation to continuously evaluate potential hazards in
the drone's field of view. By using a specialized deep neural network to assign
pixel-level risk values and applying an algorithm based on risk maps, our
method adaptively identifies a stable Safe Landing Zone (SLZ) despite moving
critical obstacles such as vehicles, people, etc., and other visual challenges
like shifting illumination. A control system then guides the UAV toward this
low-risk region, employing altitude-dependent safety thresholds and temporal
landing point stabilization to ensure robust descent trajectories. Experimental
validation in diverse urban environments demonstrates the effectiveness of our
approach, achieving over 90% landing success rates in very challenging real
scenarios, showing significant improvements in various risk metrics. Our
findings suggest that risk-oriented vision methods can effectively help reduce
the risk of accidents in emergency landing situations, particularly in complex,
unstructured, urban scenarios, densely populated with moving risky obstacles,
while potentiating the true capabilities of UAVs in complex urban operations.

Conclusion: 说话者间注意力模块能有效提升多人在场场景下的说话者提取性能，且具有通用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Audio-visual speaker extraction isolates a target speaker's speech from a
mixture speech signal conditioned on a visual cue, typically using the target
speaker's face recording. However, in real-world scenarios, other co-occurring
faces are often present on-screen, providing valuable speaker activity cues in
the scene. In this work, we introduce a plug-and-play inter-speaker attention
module to process these flexible numbers of co-occurring faces, allowing for
more accurate speaker extraction in complex multi-person environments. We
integrate our module into two prominent models: the AV-DPRNN and the
state-of-the-art AV-TFGridNet. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets,
including the highly overlapped VoxCeleb2 and sparsely overlapped MISP,
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore,
cross-dataset evaluations on LRS2 and LRS3 confirm the robustness and
generalizability of our method.

tailored for OT-driven microrobot in cooperative biological object manipulation
tasks. This integration allows for an adaptive blend of manual and autonomous
control, enabling seamless transitions between human input and autonomous

time by approximately 67% compared to using pure human or RL control alone and
achieving a 100% success rate. With its high fidelity, interactivity, low cost,

Abstract: Bioacoustic sound event detection (BioSED) is crucial for biodiversity

labeling budget, we apply the mismatch-first farthest-traversal (MFFT), an
active learning method integrating committee voting disagreement and diversity
analysis. We also refine an existing BioSED dataset specifically for evaluating
active learning algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that MFFT achieves
a mAP of 68% when cold-starting and 71% when warm-starting (which is close to
the fully-supervised mAP of 75%) while using only 2.3% of the annotations.
Notably, MFFT excels in cold-start scenarios and with rare species, which are

through modifications such as note splitting, arpeggiation, minor track dropout
(excluding bass), and re-instrumentation. A user study confirms that positive
pairs indeed contain similar melodies, with other musical tracks significantly
changed. Second, we develop a segment-wise melodic-similarity detection model
that uses a MERT encoder and applies a triplet neural network to capture
melodic similarity. The resultant decision matrix highlights where plagiarism
might occur. Our model achieves high accuracy on the MelodySim test set.

Abstract: Recent table representation learning and data discovery methods tackle table
union search (TUS) within data lakes, which involves identifying tables that
can be unioned with a given query table to enrich its content. These methods
are commonly evaluated using benchmarks that aim to assess semantic
understanding in real-world TUS tasks. However, our analysis of prominent TUS
benchmarks reveals several limitations that allow simple baselines to perform
surprisingly well, often outperforming more sophisticated approaches. This
suggests that current benchmark scores are heavily influenced by
dataset-specific characteristics and fail to effectively isolate the gains from
semantic understanding. To address this, we propose essential criteria for
future benchmarks to enable a more realistic and reliable evaluation of
progress in semantic table union search.

Abstract: The performance of speaker verification systems is adversely affected by
speaker aging. However, due to challenges in data collection, particularly the
lack of sustained and large-scale longitudinal data for individuals, research
on speaker aging remains difficult. In this paper, we present VoxAging, a
large-scale longitudinal dataset collected from 293 speakers (226 English
speakers and 67 Mandarin speakers) over several years, with the longest time
span reaching 17 years (approximately 900 weeks). For each speaker, the data
were recorded at weekly intervals. We studied the phenomenon of speaker aging
and its effects on advanced speaker verification systems, analyzed individual
speaker aging processes, and explored the impact of factors such as age group
and gender on speaker aging research.

Motivation: 传统VI方法在CSGs中缺乏对近似精度的保证，作者旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出有界（区间）VI方法，结合上下界逼近序列，并在两者接近时终止迭代。

Result: 改进的VI方法能够提供更精确的近似解。

Conclusion: 有界VI方法在CSGs中优于传统VI，提供了精度保证。

Abstract: We consider two-player zero-sum concurrent stochastic games (CSGs) played on
graphs with reachability and safety objectives. These include degenerate
classes such as Markov decision processes or turn-based stochastic games, which
can be solved by linear or quadratic programming; however, in practice, value
iteration (VI) outperforms the other approaches and is the most implemented
method. Similarly, for CSGs, this practical performance makes VI an attractive
alternative to the standard theoretical solution via the existential theory of
reals.
  VI starts with an under-approximation of the sought values for each state and
iteratively updates them, traditionally terminating once two consecutive
approximations are $\epsilon$-close. However, this stopping criterion lacks
guarantees on the precision of the approximation, which is the goal of this
work. We provide bounded (a.k.a. interval) VI for CSGs: it complements standard
VI with a converging sequence of over-approximations and terminates once the
over- and under-approximations are $\epsilon$-close.

Motivation: 传统语音增强方法依赖手工设计的损失函数或预训练的深度特征损失，但这些方法往往无法捕捉对性能至关重要的细微信号特性。

Method: 提出'Model as Loss'范式，利用模型编码器的任务特定特征空间作为损失函数，优化解码器以生成与干净信号感知和任务相关特性一致的输出。

Result: 该方法在标准语音增强基准测试中优于预训练的深度特征损失，提供更好的感知质量和鲁棒性，适用于域内和域外数据集。

Conclusion: 'Model as Loss'是一种有效的训练范式，能够通过自一致性提升语音增强模型的性能。

Abstract: Conventional methods for speech enhancement rely on handcrafted loss
functions (e.g., time or frequency domain losses) or deep feature losses (e.g.,
using WavLM or wav2vec), which often fail to capture subtle signal properties
essential for optimal performance. To address this, we propose Model as Loss, a
novel training paradigm that utilizes the encoder from the same model as a loss
function to guide the training.
  The Model as Loss paradigm leverages the encoder's task-specific feature
space, optimizing the decoder to produce output consistent with perceptual and
task-relevant characteristics of the clean signal. By using the encoder's
learned features as a loss function, this framework enforces self-consistency
between the clean reference speech and the enhanced model output. Our approach
outperforms pre-trained deep feature losses on standard speech enhancement
benchmarks, offering better perceptual quality and robust generalization to
both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Abstract: Smart microscopy represents a paradigm shift in biological imaging, moving
from passive observation tools to active collaborators in scientific inquiry.
Enabled by advances in automation, computational power, and artificial
intelligence, these systems are now capable of adaptive decision-making and
real-time experimental control. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that
reconceptualizes smart microscopy as a partner in scientific investigation.
Central to our framework is the concept of the 'epistemic-empirical divide' in
cellular investigation-the gap between what is observable (empirical domain)
and what must be understood (epistemic domain). We propose six core design
principles: epistemic-empirical awareness, hierarchical context integration, an
evolution from detection to perception, adaptive measurement frameworks,
narrative synthesis capabilities, and cross-contextual reasoning. Together,
these principles guide a multi-agent architecture designed to align empirical
observation with the goals of scientific understanding. Our framework provides
a roadmap for building microscopy systems that go beyond automation to actively
support hypothesis generation, insight discovery, and theory development,
redefining the role of scientific instruments in the process of knowledge
creation.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative frequency-embedded 3D Gaussian splatting
(3DGS) algorithm for wideband radio-frequency (RF) radiance field modeling,
offering an advancement over the existing works limited to single-frequency
modeling. Grounded in fundamental physics, we uncover the complex relationship
between EM wave propagation behaviors and RF frequencies. Inspired by this, we
design an EM feature network with attenuation and radiance modules to learn the
complex relationships between RF frequencies and the key properties of each 3D
Gaussian, specifically the attenuation factor and RF signal intensity. By
training the frequency-embedded 3DGS model, we can efficiently reconstruct RF
radiance fields at arbitrary unknown frequencies within a given 3D environment.
Finally, we propose a large-scale power angular spectrum (PAS) dataset
containing 50000 samples ranging from 1 to 100 GHz in 6 indoor environments,
and conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method.
Our approach achieves an average Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) up
to 0.72, and a significant improvement up to 17.8% compared to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods trained on individual test frequencies.
Additionally, our method achieves an SSIM of 0.70 without prior training on
these frequencies, which represents only a 2.8% performance drop compared to
models trained with full PAS data. This demonstrates our model's capability to
estimate PAS at unknown frequencies. For related code and datasets, please

Abstract: Controlling singing style is crucial for achieving an expressive and natural
singing voice. Among the various style factors, vibrato plays a key role in
conveying emotions and enhancing musical depth. However, modeling vibrato
remains challenging due to its dynamic nature, making it difficult to control
in singing voice conversion. To address this, we propose VibESVC, a
controllable singing voice conversion model that explicitly extracts and
manipulates vibrato using discrete wavelet transform. Unlike previous methods
that model vibrato implicitly, our approach decomposes the F0 contour into
frequency components, enabling precise transfer. This allows vibrato control
for enhanced flexibility. Experimental results show that VibE-SVC effectively
transforms singing styles while preserving speaker similarity. Both subjective
and objective evaluations confirm high-quality conversion.

Conclusion: SfC-NeRF能够有效估计物体的内部结构，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural 3D representations, such as neural radiance
fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), have enabled the accurate
estimation of 3D structures from multiview images. However, this capability is
limited to estimating the visible external structure, and identifying the
invisible internal structure hidden behind the surface is difficult. To
overcome this limitation, we address a new task called Structure from Collision
(SfC), which aims to estimate the structure (including the invisible internal
structure) of an object from appearance changes during collision. To solve this
problem, we propose a novel model called SfC-NeRF that optimizes the invisible
internal structure of an object through a video sequence under physical,
appearance (i.e., visible external structure)-preserving, and keyframe
constraints. In particular, to avoid falling into undesirable local optima
owing to its ill-posed nature, we propose volume annealing; that is, searching
for global optima by repeatedly reducing and expanding the volume. Extensive
experiments on 115 objects involving diverse structures (i.e., various cavity
shapes, locations, and sizes) and material properties revealed the properties
of SfC and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed SfC-NeRF.

Abstract: Background and objective: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a novel imaging
modality with diagnostic accuracy comparable to MRI for detecting clinically
significant prostate cancer (csPCa). We investigated whether artificial
intelligence (AI) interpretation of micro-US can outperform clinical screening
methods using PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE). Methods: We
retrospectively studied 145 men who underwent micro-US guided biopsy (79 with
csPCa, 66 without). A self-supervised convolutional autoencoder was used to
extract deep image features from 2D micro-US slices. Random forest classifiers
were trained using five-fold cross-validation to predict csPCa at the slice
level. Patients were classified as csPCa-positive if 88 or more consecutive
slices were predicted positive. Model performance was compared with a
classifier using PSA, DRE, prostate volume, and age. Key findings and
limitations: The AI-based micro-US model and clinical screening model achieved
AUROCs of 0.871 and 0.753, respectively. At a fixed threshold, the micro-US
model achieved 92.5% sensitivity and 68.1% specificity, while the clinical
model showed 96.2% sensitivity but only 27.3% specificity. Limitations include
a retrospective single-center design and lack of external validation.
Conclusions and clinical implications: AI-interpreted micro-US improves
specificity while maintaining high sensitivity for csPCa detection. This method
may reduce unnecessary biopsies and serve as a low-cost alternative to
PSA-based screening. Patient summary: We developed an AI system to analyze
prostate micro-ultrasound images. It outperformed PSA and DRE in detecting
aggressive cancer and may help avoid unnecessary biopsies.

Abstract: This paper presents a formal categorical proof that exam-driven educational

framework of Alpay Algebra II and III, we define Exam-Grade Collapse Systems
(EGCS) as functorial constructs where learning dynamics $\varphi$ are
recursively collapsed by evaluative morphisms $E$. We prove that under such
collapse regimes, no nontrivial fixed-point algebra $\mu_\varphi$ can exist,
hence learner identity cannot stabilize. This creates a universal fixed-point
trap: all generative functors are entropically folded before symbolic emergence
occurs. Our model mathematically explains the creativity suppression, research
stagnation, and structural entropy loss induced by timed exams and grade-based
feedback. The results apply category theory to expose why modern educational
systems prevent {\phi}-emergence and block observer-invariant self-formation.
This work provides the first provable algebraic obstruction of identity
formation caused by institutional feedback mechanics.

Conclusion: 深度学习在大规模光度金属丰度估计中表现优异，适用于恒星种群和银河结构研究。

Abstract: RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are old pulsating variables widely used as metallicity
tracers due to the correlation between their metal abundances and light curve
morphology. With ESA Gaia DR3 providing light curves for about 270,000 RRLs,
there is a pressing need for scalable methods to estimate their metallicities
from photometric data. We introduce a unified deep learning framework that
estimates metallicities for both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone
(RRc) RRLs using Gaia G-band light curves. This approach extends our previous
work on RRab stars to include RRc stars, aiming for high predictive accuracy
and broad generalization across both pulsation types. The model is based on a
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network optimized for time-series extrinsic
regression. Our pipeline includes preprocessing steps such as phase folding,
smoothing, and sample weighting, and uses photometric metallicities from the
literature as training targets. The architecture is designed to handle
morphological differences between RRab and RRc light curves without requiring
separate models. On held-out validation sets, our GRU model achieves strong
performance: for RRab stars, MAE = 0.0565 dex, RMSE = 0.0765 dex, R^2 = 0.9401;
for RRc stars, MAE = 0.0505 dex, RMSE = 0.0720 dex, R^2 = 0.9625. These results
show the effectiveness of deep learning for large-scale photometric metallicity
estimation and support its application to studies of stellar populations and
Galactic structure.

Motivation: 在微调预训练大语言模型（LLMs）以对齐人类价值观和意图时，最大化奖励可能导致性能提升，但也带来偏离参考模型行为的风险。现有方法通常使用KL散度约束，但某些应用需要更严格的风险控制。

Result: 在IMDb、Anthropic HH和AlpacaEval三个开源数据集上的实验表明，该方法在平衡对齐性能和模型漂移方面表现优越。

Conclusion: Ra-DPO通过风险感知优化，有效提升了模型对齐性能并控制了风险。

Abstract: When fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to align with human
values and intentions, maximizing the estimated reward can lead to superior
performance, but it also introduces potential risks due to deviations from the
reference model's intended behavior. Most existing methods typically introduce
KL divergence to constrain deviations between the trained model and the
reference model; however, this may not be sufficient in certain applications
that require tight risk control. In this paper, we introduce Risk-aware Direct
Preference Optimization (Ra-DPO), a novel approach that incorporates
risk-awareness by employing a class of nested risk measures. This approach
formulates a constrained risk-aware advantage function maximization problem and
then converts the Bradley-Terry model into a token-level representation. The
objective function maximizes the likelihood of the policy while suppressing the
deviation between a trained model and the reference model using a sequential
risk ratio, thereby enhancing the model's risk-awareness. Experimental results
across three open-source datasets: IMDb Dataset, Anthropic HH Dataset, and
AlpacaEval, demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance in balancing
alignment performance and model drift. Our code is opensourced at

Result: GTA匹配GQA质量但减少一半KV缓存，GLA匹配MLA性能且更易分片，解码速度提升2倍。

Conclusion: GTA和GLA显著提升解码效率，适合在线服务场景。

Abstract: LLM decoding is bottlenecked for large batches and long contexts by loading
the key-value (KV) cache from high-bandwidth memory, which inflates per-token
latency, while the sequential nature of decoding limits parallelism. We analyze
the interplay among arithmetic intensity, parallelization, and model quality
and question whether current architectures fully exploit modern hardware. This
work redesigns attention to perform more computation per byte loaded from
memory to maximize hardware efficiency without trading off parallel
scalability. We first propose Grouped-Tied Attention (GTA), a simple variant
that combines and reuses key and value states, reducing memory transfers
without compromising model quality. We then introduce Grouped Latent Attention
(GLA), a parallel-friendly latent attention paired with low-level optimizations
for fast decoding while maintaining high model quality. Experiments show that
GTA matches Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) quality while using roughly half the
KV cache and that GLA matches Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and is easier
to shard. Our optimized GLA kernel is up to 2$\times$ faster than FlashMLA, for
example, in a speculative decoding setting when the query length exceeds one.
Furthermore, by fetching a smaller KV cache per device, GLA reduces end-to-end
latency and increases throughput in online serving benchmarks by up to
2$\times$.

Result: 显著降低延迟和内存使用，生成质量优于其他缓存方法（FID和t-FID指标）。

Conclusion: FastCache在保持生成质量的同时，显著提升了DiT的推理效率。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are powerful generative models but remain
computationally intensive due to their iterative structure and deep transformer
stacks. To alleviate this inefficiency, we propose FastCache, a
hidden-state-level caching and compression framework that accelerates DiT
inference by exploiting redundancy within the model's internal representations.
FastCache introduces a dual strategy: (1) a spatial-aware token selection
mechanism that adaptively filters redundant tokens based on hidden state
saliency, and (2) a transformer-level cache that reuses latent activations
across timesteps when changes are statistically insignificant. These modules
work jointly to reduce unnecessary computation while preserving generation
fidelity through learnable linear approximation. Theoretical analysis shows
that FastCache maintains bounded approximation error under a
hypothesis-testing-based decision rule. Empirical evaluations across multiple
DiT variants demonstrate substantial reductions in latency and memory usage,
with best generation output quality compared to other cache methods, as
measured by FID and t-FID. Code implementation of FastCache is available on
GitHub at https://github.com/NoakLiu/FastCache-xDiT.

TL;DR: GraLoRA improves LoRA by partitioning weight matrices into sub-blocks with individual low-rank adapters, overcoming overfitting and gradient issues, achieving better performance than LoRA and baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's structural bottleneck causes gradient entanglement and limits performance, especially at higher ranks, falling short of full fine-tuning.

Method: GraLoRA partitions weight matrices into sub-blocks, each with its own low-rank adapter, increasing representational capacity without added cost.

Result: GraLoRA outperforms LoRA and baselines, with up to +8.5% absolute gain in Pass@1 on HumanEval+, scalable across model sizes and ranks.

Conclusion: GraLoRA is a robust and scalable solution for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, closely approximating full fine-tuning performance.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular method for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) of generative models, valued for its simplicity and
effectiveness. Despite recent enhancements, LoRA still suffers from a
fundamental limitation: overfitting when the bottleneck is widened. It performs
best at ranks 32-64, yet its accuracy stagnates or declines at higher ranks,
still falling short of full fine-tuning (FFT) performance. We identify the root
cause as LoRA's structural bottleneck, which introduces gradient entanglement
to the unrelated input channels and distorts gradient propagation. To address
this, we introduce a novel structure, Granular Low-Rank Adaptation (GraLoRA)
that partitions weight matrices into sub-blocks, each with its own low-rank
adapter. With negligible computational or storage cost, GraLoRA overcomes
LoRA's limitations, effectively increases the representational capacity, and
more closely approximates FFT behavior. Experiments on code generation and
commonsense reasoning benchmarks show that GraLoRA consistently outperforms
LoRA and other baselines, achieving up to +8.5% absolute gain in Pass@1 on
HumanEval+. These improvements hold across model sizes and rank settings,
making GraLoRA a scalable and robust solution for PEFT. Code, data, and scripts

Conclusion: GRAPE通过动态多任务优化，显著提升了预训练语言模型在多任务和多语言场景下的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) across diverse downstream
applications is fundamentally governed by the quality and composition of their
pretraining corpora. Existing domain reweighting algorithms primarily optimize
data mixtures for a single target task, thereby resulting in models that
overfit to specialized objectives while exhibiting substantial performance
degradation on other benchmarks. This paper introduces Group Robust
Multi-target Adaptive PrEtraining (GRAPE), a novel multi-source-multi-target
domain reweighting framework designed to calibrate pretraining data mixtures
for robust performance across multiple target tasks simultaneously. GRAPE
dynamically adjusts sampling weights across source domains (domain weights)
while concurrently modulating task weights that quantify the relative
importance of each individual target task. This adaptive process prioritizes
tasks based on their learning difficulty throughout training. We formulate this
interleaved reweighting mechanism as a minimax optimization problem: The inner
maximization adjusts task weights leveraging group
distributed-robust-optimization (DRO), where those tasks demonstrating the
least improvement under the current data mixture are prioritized with higher
weights; The outer minimization then optimizes domain weights to maximize loss
reduction on the prioritized tasks. Experiments on ClimbLab and SlimPajama
datasets demonstrate that GRAPE consistently outperforms baseline methods in
terms of reasoning performance across 6 benchmarks. Furthermore, when applied
to multilingual targets, GRAPE effectively identifies optimal training mixtures
from mainstream languages, achieving superior language modeling capabilities
across 8 low-resource target languages.

Method: 采用持久同调（PH）分析六种先进LLMs的潜在空间拓扑结构，并引入神经元级PH框架量化信息流动。

Result: 对抗条件压缩潜在拓扑结构，减少小尺度结构多样性，放大粗尺度主导特征，且这些特征在网络深层更显著。

Conclusion: PH为解释LLMs在分布偏移下的表征动态提供了统一方法。

Abstract: Understanding how adversarial conditions affect language models requires
techniques that capture both global structure and local detail within
high-dimensional activation spaces. We propose persistent homology (PH), a tool
from topological data analysis, to systematically characterize multiscale
latent space dynamics in LLMs under two distinct attack modes -- backdoor
fine-tuning and indirect prompt injection. By analyzing six state-of-the-art
LLMs, we show that adversarial conditions consistently compress latent
topologies, reducing structural diversity at smaller scales while amplifying
dominant features at coarser ones. These topological signatures are
statistically robust across layers, architectures, model sizes, and align with
the emergence of adversarial effects deeper in the network. To capture
finer-grained mechanisms underlying these shifts, we introduce a neuron-level
PH framework that quantifies how information flows and transforms within and
across layers. Together, our findings demonstrate that PH offers a principled
and unifying approach to interpreting representational dynamics in LLMs,
particularly under distributional shift.

Motivation: FP8数据格式在LLM预训练中具有潜力，但由于规模扩展时的稳定性问题，其应用受限。现有方法要么依赖次优的FP8内核，要么在敏感组件中回退到高精度计算，限制了吞吐量提升。

Method: 提出了一种新的LLM架构，首次支持在Transformer块的所有GEMM中使用FP8计算（包括前向和后向传播），并通过减少大异常激活值来稳定FP8训练。

Result: 实现了前所未有的吞吐量提升，尤其是在大规模训练中，同时下游性能与标准BF16训练相当。

Conclusion: 该架构设计为FP8在LLM训练中的广泛应用提供了可行性，并提出了监控低精度训练的关键指标。

Abstract: Despite the significant potential of FP8 data formats for large language
model (LLM) pre-training, their adoption has been limited due to challenges in
maintaining stability at scale. Existing approaches often rely on suboptimal
fine-grained FP8 kernels or fall back to higher-precision matrix
multiplications (GEMMs) in sensitive components, such as attention projections,
compromising potential throughput gains. We introduce a new class of LLM
architectures that, for the first time, support FP8 computation for all GEMMs
within transformer blocks during both forward and backward passes. This enables
unprecedented throughput gains, particularly at scale, while matching the
downstream performance of standard BF16 training. Our architecture design
reduces large outlier activations, promoting stable long-term FP8 training. In
addition, we identify key metrics to monitor low-precision training and predict
potential future divergences.

Abstract: This work proposes `PET', a novel pessimistic reward fine-tuning method, to
learn a pessimistic reward model robust against reward hacking in offline
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Traditional reward modeling
techniques in RLHF train an imperfect reward model, on which a KL
regularization plays a pivotal role in mitigating reward hacking when
optimizing a policy. Such an intuition-based method still suffers from reward
hacking, and the policies with large KL divergence from the dataset
distribution are excluded during learning. In contrast, we show that when
optimizing a policy on a pessimistic reward model fine-tuned through PET,
reward hacking can be prevented without relying on any regularization. We test
our methods on the standard TL;DR summarization dataset. We find that one can
learn a high-quality policy on our pessimistic reward without using any
regularization. Such a policy has a high KL divergence from the dataset
distribution while having high performance in practice. In summary, our work
shows the feasibility of learning a pessimistic reward model against reward
hacking. The agent can greedily search for the policy with a high pessimistic
reward without suffering from reward hacking.

Result: 在合成和数学推理任务上的实验表明，BARL在测试时优于传统马尔可夫强化学习方法，具有更高的标记效率和探索效果。

Conclusion: BARL为LLM的反思性探索提供了理论指导，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) have
exhibited strong reasoning capabilities and emergent reflective behaviors, such
as backtracking and error correction. However, conventional Markovian RL
confines exploration to the training phase to learn an optimal deterministic
policy and depends on the history contexts only through the current state.
Therefore, it remains unclear whether reflective reasoning will emerge during
Markovian RL training, or why they are beneficial at test time. To remedy this,
we recast reflective exploration within the Bayes-Adaptive RL framework, which
explicitly optimizes the expected return under a posterior distribution over
Markov decision processes. This Bayesian formulation inherently incentivizes
both reward-maximizing exploitation and information-gathering exploration via
belief updates. Our resulting algorithm, BARL, instructs the LLM to stitch and
switch strategies based on the observed outcomes, offering principled guidance
on when and how the model should reflectively explore. Empirical results on
both synthetic and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that BARL
outperforms standard Markovian RL approaches at test time, achieving superior
token efficiency with improved exploration effectiveness. Our code is available

Conclusion: 定制约束优化方法更适合可信AI系统，提供更好的问责性和效率。

Abstract: Recent efforts toward developing trustworthy AI systems with accountability
guarantees have led to a growing reliance on machine learning formulations that
incorporate external requirements, or constraints. These requirements are often
enforced through penalization--adding fixed-weight terms to the task loss. We
argue that this approach is ill-suited, and that tailored constrained
optimization methods should be adopted instead. In particular, no penalty
coefficient may yield a solution that both satisfies the constraints and
achieves good performance--i.e., one solving the constrained problem. Moreover,
tuning these coefficients is costly, incurring significant time and
computational overhead. In contrast, tailored constrained methods--such as the
Lagrangian approach, which optimizes the penalization "coefficients" (the
Lagrange multipliers) alongside the model--(i) truly solve the constrained
problem and add accountability, (ii) eliminate the need for extensive penalty
tuning, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with modern deep learning pipelines.

Conclusion: LLMs可以通过反复接触任务实现推理加速，SpeedupLLM框架为这一行为提供了理论保证和实现方法。

Abstract: Allocating more compute to large language models (LLMs) reasoning has
generally been demonstrated to improve their effectiveness, but also results in
increased inference time. In contrast, humans can perform tasks faster and
better with increased experience and exposure. Hence, this paper aims to
investigate the question: Can LLMs also become faster at reasoning through
recurrent exposure on relevant tasks, and if so, how can it be achieved? To
address these questions, we first formalize the problem setting of LLM
reasoning speedup systematically in the dimensions of task relevancy and
compute budget calculation. We then propose SpeedupLLM, a theoretically
guaranteed framework to implement and benchmark such reasoning speedup
behaviour based on adaptive compute allocation and memory mechanisms. We
further conduct comprehensive experiments to benchmark such behaviour across
different question similarity levels, memory methods, and reasoning methods.
Results show that LLMs can generally reason faster with past experience,
achieving up to a 56% reduction in compute cost when equipped with appropriate

of relying solely on a static attention matrix, we allow attention weights to
evolve over a pseudo_time dimension via diffusion, wave, or reaction_diffusion
dynamics. This mechanism systematically smooths local noise, enhances
long_range dependencies, and stabilizes gradient flow. Theoretically, our
analysis shows that PDE_based attention leads to better optimization landscapes
and polynomial rather than exponential decay of distant interactions.
Empirically, we benchmark our method on diverse experiments_demonstrating
consistent gains over both standard and specialized long sequence Transformer
variants. Our findings highlight the potential of PDE_based formulations to
enrich attention mechanisms with continuous_time dynamics and global coherence.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) to improve complex reasoning abilities. However,
state-of-the-art policy optimization methods often suffer from high
computational overhead and memory consumption, primarily due to the need for
multiple generations per prompt and the reliance on critic networks or
advantage estimates of the current policy. In this paper, we propose $A$*-PO, a
novel two-stage policy optimization framework that directly approximates the
optimal advantage function and enables efficient training of LLMs for reasoning
tasks. In the first stage, we leverage offline sampling from a reference policy
to estimate the optimal value function $V$*, eliminating the need for costly
online value estimation. In the second stage, we perform on-policy updates
using a simple least-squares regression loss with only a single generation per
prompt. Theoretically, we establish performance guarantees and prove that the
KL-regularized RL objective can be optimized without requiring complex
exploration strategies. Empirically, $A$*-PO achieves competitive performance
across a wide range of mathematical reasoning benchmarks, while reducing
training time by up to 2$\times$ and peak memory usage by over 30% compared to
PPO, GRPO, and REBEL. Implementation of $A$*-PO can be found at

Conclusion: Simba不仅提高了效率，还改善了长序列中的信息流。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising architecture for sequence
modeling, providing an alternative to Transformers by replacing expensive
self-attention with linear recurrences. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective trick to enhance SSMs within given computational budgets by
sparsifying them. Our intuition is that tokens in SSMs are highly redundant due
to gradual recurrent updates, and dense recurrence operations block the
delivery of past information. In particular, we observe that upper layers of
SSMs tend to be more redundant as they encode global information, while lower
layers encode local information. Motivated by this, we introduce Simba, a
hierarchical sparsification method for SSMs based on token pruning. Simba
sparsifies upper layers more than lower layers, encouraging the upper layers to
behave like highways. To achieve this, we propose a novel token pruning
criterion for SSMs, measuring the global impact of tokens on the final output
by accumulating local recurrences. We demonstrate that Simba outperforms the
baseline model, Mamba, with the same FLOPS in various natural language tasks.
Moreover, we illustrate the effect of highways, showing that Simba not only
enhances efficiency but also improves the information flow across long
sequences. Code is available at https://github.com/woominsong/Simba.

Abstract: Transformers have reshaped machine learning by utilizing attention mechanisms
to capture complex patterns in large datasets, leading to significant
improvements in performance. This success has contributed to the belief that
"bigger means better", leading to ever-increasing model sizes. This paper
challenge this ideology by showing that many existing transformers might be
unnecessarily oversized. We discover a theoretical principle that redefines the
role of multi-head attention. An important benefit of the multiple heads is in
improving the conditioning of the attention block. We exploit this theoretical
insight and redesign popular architectures with an increased number of heads.
The improvement in the conditioning proves so significant in practice that
model depth can be decreased, reducing the parameter count by up to 30-50%
while maintaining accuracy. We obtain consistent benefits across a variety of
transformer-based architectures of various scales, on tasks in computer vision

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly prevalent, memory bandwidth
constraints significantly limit inference throughput, motivating post-training
quantization (PTQ). In this paper, we propose FireQ, a co-designed PTQ
framework and an INT4-FP8 matrix multiplication kernel that accelerates LLM
inference across all linear layers. Specifically, FireQ quantizes linear layer
weights and key-values to INT4, and activations and queries to FP8,
significantly enhancing throughput. Additionally, we introduce a three-stage
pipelining for the prefill phase, which modifies the FlashAttention-3 kernel,
effectively reducing time-to-first-token in the prefill phase. To minimize
accuracy loss from quantization, we develop novel outlier smoothing techniques
tailored separately for linear and attention layers. In linear layers, we
explicitly use per-tensor scaling to prevent underflow caused by the FP8
quantization scaling factor of INT4 quantization, and channel-wise scaling to
compensate for coarse granularity of INT4. In attention layers, we address
quantization challenges posed by rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) by
combining pre-RoPE and post-RoPE scaling strategies. FireQ significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.68x faster inference in
feed-forward network layers on Llama2-7B and 1.26x faster prefill phase

Conclusion: Transformer模型可以在没有显式架构支持的情况下学习系统化的变量绑定，为连接主义和符号方法的结合提供了新视角。

Abstract: Variable binding -- the ability to associate variables with values -- is
fundamental to symbolic computation and cognition. Although classical
architectures typically implement variable binding via addressable memory, it
is not well understood how modern neural networks lacking built-in binding
operations may acquire this capacity. We investigate this by training a
Transformer to dereference queried variables in symbolic programs where
variables are assigned either numerical constants or other variables. Each
program requires following chains of variable assignments up to four steps deep
to find the queried value, and also contains irrelevant chains of assignments
acting as distractors. Our analysis reveals a developmental trajectory with
three distinct phases during training: (1) random prediction of numerical
constants, (2) a shallow heuristic prioritizing early variable assignments, and
(3) the emergence of a systematic mechanism for dereferencing assignment
chains. Using causal interventions, we find that the model learns to exploit
the residual stream as an addressable memory space, with specialized attention
heads routing information across token positions. This mechanism allows the
model to dynamically track variable bindings across layers, resulting in
accurate dereferencing. Our results show how Transformer models can learn to
implement systematic variable binding without explicit architectural support,
bridging connectionist and symbolic approaches.

Result: Pause tokens strictly increase expressivity, enabling Transformers to compute AC⁰ and TC⁰ functions, and learn parity in practice.

Conclusion: Pause tokens are a distinct mechanism for enhancing Transformer reasoning, complementary to chain-of-thought prompting.

Abstract: Pause tokens, simple filler symbols such as "...", consistently improve
Transformer performance on both language and mathematical tasks, yet their
theoretical effect remains unexplained. We provide the first formal separation
result, proving that adding pause tokens to constant-depth, logarithmic-width
Transformers strictly increases their computational expressivity. With
bounded-precision activations, Transformers without pause tokens compute only a
strict subset of $\mathsf{AC}^0$ functions, while adding a polynomial number of
pause tokens allows them to express the entire class. For logarithmic-precision
Transformers, we show that adding pause tokens achieves expressivity equivalent
to $\mathsf{TC}^0$, matching known upper bounds. Empirically, we demonstrate
that two-layer causally masked Transformers can learn parity when supplied with
pause tokens, a function that they appear unable to learn without them. Our
results provide a rigorous theoretical explanation for prior empirical
findings, clarify how pause tokens interact with width, depth, and numeric
precision, and position them as a distinct mechanism, complementary to
chain-of-thought prompting, for enhancing Transformer reasoning.

substitution, selecting the LLM layers with the lowest linearization error. NBL
can be efficiently applied to pre-trained LLMs without the need for
fine-tuning. In experiments, NBL achieves notable computational speed-ups while
preserving competitive accuracy on multiple reasoning benchmarks. For instance,
applying NBL to 12 self-attention layers in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
increases the inference speed by 32% with less than 1% accuracy trade-off,
making it a flexible and promising solution to improve the inference efficiency

exploration, safe decision-making, and offline RL. While deep ensembles provide
a robust method for quantifying value uncertainty, they come with significant
computational overhead. Single-model methods, while computationally favorable,
often rely on heuristics and typically require additional propagation
mechanisms for myopic uncertainty estimates. In this work we introduce
universal value-function uncertainties (UVU), which, similar in spirit to
random network distillation (RND), quantify uncertainty as squared prediction
errors between an online learner and a fixed, randomly initialized target
network. Unlike RND, UVU errors reflect policy-conditional value uncertainty,
incorporating the future uncertainties any given policy may encounter. This is
due to the training procedure employed in UVU: the online network is trained
using temporal difference learning with a synthetic reward derived from the
fixed, randomly initialized target network. We provide an extensive theoretical
analysis of our approach using neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory and show that
in the limit of infinite network width, UVU errors are exactly equivalent to
the variance of an ensemble of independent universal value functions.
Empirically, we show that UVU achieves equal performance to large ensembles on
challenging multi-task offline RL settings, while offering simplicity and
substantial computational savings.

Abstract: The efficiency of attention is critical because its time complexity grows
quadratically with sequence length. SageAttention2 addresses this by utilizing
quantization to accelerate matrix multiplications (Matmul) in attention. To
further accelerate SageAttention2, we propose to utilize the faster instruction
of FP8 Matmul accumulated in FP16. The instruction is 2x faster than the FP8
Matmul used in SageAttention2. Our experiments show that SageAttention2++
achieves a 3.9x speedup over FlashAttention while maintaining the same
attention accuracy as SageAttention2. This means SageAttention2++ effectively
accelerates various models, including those for language, image, and video
generation, with negligible end-to-end metrics loss. The code will be available

Abstract: To construct responsible and secure AI applications, harmful information data
is widely utilized for adversarial testing and the development of safeguards.
Existing studies mainly leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize
data to obtain high-quality task datasets at scale, thereby avoiding costly
human annotation. However, limited by the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs,
the synthesis of harmful data still faces challenges in generation reliability
and content diversity. In this study, we propose a novel harmful information
synthesis framework, PoisonSwarm, which applies the model crowdsourcing
strategy to generate diverse harmful data while maintaining a high success
rate. Specifically, we generate abundant benign data as the based templates in
a counterfactual manner. Subsequently, we decompose each based template into
multiple semantic units and perform unit-by-unit toxification and final
refinement through dynamic model switching, thus ensuring the success of
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that PoisonSwarm achieves
state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing different categories of harmful
data with high scalability and diversity.

Result: LoFT显著缩小了与全微调的性能差距，且优于标准LoRA方法。

Conclusion: LoFT是一种高效的低秩适应方法，无需额外超参数调整，性能接近全微调。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models are commonly adapted to downstream tasks using
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
which injects small trainable low-rank matrices instead of updating all
weights. While LoRA dramatically reduces trainable parameters with little
overhead, it can still underperform full fine-tuning in accuracy and often
converges more slowly. We introduce LoFT, a novel low-rank adaptation method
that behaves like full fine-tuning by aligning the optimizer's internal
dynamics with those of updating all model weights. LoFT not only learns weight
updates in a low-rank subspace (like LoRA) but also properly projects the
optimizer's first and second moments (Adam's momentum and variance) into the
same subspace, mirroring full-model updates. By aligning the low-rank update
itself with the full update, LoFT eliminates the need for tuning extra
hyperparameters, e.g., LoRA scaling factor $\alpha$. Empirically, this approach
substantially narrows the performance gap between adapter-based tuning and full
fine-tuning and consistently outperforms standard LoRA-style methods, all
without increasing inference cost.

Result: MxDs在3B参数的语言模型中显著优于现有方法（如Transcoders），并在稀疏探测和特征导向任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: MxDs为设计既可解释又忠实分解的语言模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are an integral part of large language models,
yet their dense representations render them difficult to understand, edit, and
steer. Recent methods learn interpretable approximations via neuron-level
sparsity, yet fail to faithfully reconstruct the original
mapping--significantly increasing model's next-token cross-entropy loss. In
this paper, we advocate for moving to layer-level sparsity to overcome the
accuracy trade-off in sparse layer approximation. Under this paradigm, we
introduce Mixture of Decoders (MxDs). MxDs generalize MLPs and Gated Linear
Units, expanding pre-trained dense layers into tens of thousands of specialized
sublayers. Through a flexible form of tensor factorization, each sparsely
activating MxD sublayer implements a linear transformation with full-rank
weights--preserving the original decoders' expressive capacity even under heavy
sparsity. Experimentally, we show that MxDs significantly outperform
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., Transcoders) on the sparsity-accuracy frontier
in language models with up to 3B parameters. Further evaluations on sparse
probing and feature steering demonstrate that MxDs learn similarly specialized
features of natural language--opening up a promising new avenue for designing
interpretable yet faithful decompositions. Our code is included at:

Conclusion: Square$\chi$PO在隐私保护和鲁棒性对齐方面具有显著优势，且分析框架统一。

Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study the offline alignment of language
models with human preference feedback, under both preference label corruption
and privacy protections. To this end, we propose Square$\chi$PO, a simple
one-line change to $\chi$PO where the standard log-loss is replaced by a new
square loss over probability. Thanks to the inherent properties of this new
loss, we have advanced the state-of-the-art of differentially private and
robust offline direct alignment. Specifically, for the local model of label
privacy, Square$\chi$PO is the first algorithm that attains an optimal rate
based on single-policy concentrability even with general function
approximations. It also gives the first result under the central model of
privacy protection over both prompts (responses) and labels. On the robustness
side against Huber label corruption, Square$\chi$PO is the first alignment
method that has a meaningful theoretical guarantee under general function
approximations. More importantly, Square$\chi$PO can address privacy protection
and corruption simultaneously, where an interesting separation is observed,
implying that the order of privacy and corruption matters. Furthermore, we show
that Square$\chi$PO can also be easily extended to handle the scenario of the
general preference model with state-of-the-art guarantees under corruption and
privacy. Last but not least, all of our theoretical guarantees enjoy a unified
analysis, building upon a new result on the generalization error bounds of
least-square regression under corruption and privacy constraints, which we
believe is of independent interest to the community.

Abstract: Scaling the performance of large language models (LLMs) increasingly depends
on methods that reduce reliance on human supervision. Reinforcement learning
from automated verification offers an alternative, but it incurs scalability
limitations due to dependency upon human-designed verifiers. Self-training,
where the model's own judgment provides the supervisory signal, presents a
compelling direction. We propose an online self-training reinforcement learning
algorithm that leverages the model's self-consistency to infer correctness
signals and train without any ground-truth supervision. We apply the algorithm
to challenging mathematical reasoning tasks and show that it quickly reaches
performance levels rivaling reinforcement-learning methods trained explicitly
on gold-standard answers. Additionally, we analyze inherent limitations of the
algorithm, highlighting how the self-generated proxy reward initially
correlated with correctness can incentivize reward hacking, where confidently
incorrect outputs are favored. Our results illustrate how self-supervised
improvement can achieve significant performance gains without external labels,
while also revealing its fundamental challenges.

Abstract: The recent paradigm shift towards training large language models (LLMs) using
DeepSeek-R1-Zero-style reinforcement learning (RL) on verifiable rewards has
led to impressive advancements in code and mathematical reasoning. However,
this methodology is limited to tasks where rule-based answer verification is
possible and does not naturally extend to real-world domains such as chemistry,
healthcare, engineering, law, biology, business, and economics. Current
practical workarounds use an additional LLM as a model-based verifier; however,
this introduces issues such as reliance on a strong verifier LLM,
susceptibility to reward hacking, and the practical burden of maintaining the
verifier model in memory during training. To address this and extend
DeepSeek-R1-Zero-style training to general reasoning domains, we propose a
verifier-free method (VeriFree) that bypasses answer verification and instead
uses RL to directly maximize the probability of generating the reference
answer. We compare VeriFree with verifier-based methods and demonstrate that,
in addition to its significant practical benefits and reduced compute
requirements, VeriFree matches and even surpasses verifier-based methods on
extensive evaluations across MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, and math-related
benchmarks. Moreover, we provide insights into this method from multiple
perspectives: as an elegant integration of training both the policy and
implicit verifier in a unified model, and as a variational optimization
approach. Code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/VeriFree.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most effective,
computationally tractable fine-tuning approaches for training Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). LoRA accomplishes this by
freezing the pre-trained model weights and injecting trainable low-rank
matrices, allowing for efficient learning of these foundation models even on
edge devices. However, LoRA in decentralized settings still remains under
explored, particularly for the theoretical underpinnings due to the lack of
smoothness guarantee and model consensus interference (defined formally below).
This work improves the convergence rate of decentralized LoRA (DLoRA) to match
the rate of decentralized SGD by ensuring gradient smoothness. We also
introduce DeCAF, a novel algorithm integrating DLoRA with truncated singular
value decomposition (TSVD)-based matrix factorization to resolve consensus
interference. Theoretical analysis shows TSVD's approximation error is bounded
and consensus differences between DLoRA and DeCAF vanish as rank increases,
yielding DeCAF's matching convergence rate. Extensive experiments across
vision/language tasks demonstrate our algorithms outperform local training and
rivals federated learning under both IID and non-IID data distributions.

Abstract: In recent years, generative models have shown remarkable capabilities across
diverse fields, including images, videos, language, and decision-making. By
applying powerful generative models such as flow-based models to reinforcement
learning, we can effectively model complex multi-modal action distributions and
achieve superior robotic control in continuous action spaces, surpassing the
limitations of single-modal action distributions with traditional
Gaussian-based policies. Previous methods usually adopt the generative models
as behavior models to fit state-conditioned action distributions from datasets,
with policy optimization conducted separately through additional policies using
value-based sample weighting or gradient-based updates. However, this
separation prevents the simultaneous optimization of multi-modal distribution
fitting and policy improvement, ultimately hindering the training of models and
degrading the performance. To address this issue, we propose Decision Flow, a
unified framework that integrates multi-modal action distribution modeling and
policy optimization. Specifically, our method formulates the action generation
procedure of flow-based models as a flow decision-making process, where each
action generation step corresponds to one flow decision. Consequently, our
method seamlessly optimizes the flow policy while capturing multi-modal action
distributions. We provide rigorous proofs of Decision Flow and validate the
effectiveness through extensive experiments across dozens of offline RL
environments. Compared with established offline RL baselines, the results
demonstrate that our method achieves or matches the SOTA performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal
tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates in long-context scenarios,
particularly long videos. While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has been
widely adopted for length generalization in Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending vanilla RoPE to capture the intricate spatial-temporal dependencies
in videos remains an unsolved challenge. Existing methods typically allocate
different frequencies within RoPE to encode 3D positional information. However,
these allocation strategies mainly rely on heuristics, lacking in-depth
theoretical analysis. In this paper, we first study how different allocation
strategies impact the long-context capabilities of VLMs. Our analysis reveals
that current multimodal RoPEs fail to reliably capture semantic similarities
over extended contexts. To address this issue, we propose HoPE, a Hybrid of
Position Embedding designed to improve the long-context capabilities of VLMs.
HoPE introduces a hybrid frequency allocation strategy for reliable semantic
modeling over arbitrarily long context, and a dynamic temporal scaling
mechanism to facilitate robust learning and flexible inference across diverse
context lengths. Extensive experiments across four video benchmarks on long
video understanding and retrieval tasks demonstrate that HoPE consistently
outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness. Code is available

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful class of algorithms for optimizing
expensive black-box functions, but designing effective BO algorithms remains a
manual, expertise-driven task. Recent advancements in Large Language Models
(LLMs) have opened new avenues for automating scientific discovery, including
the automatic design of optimization algorithms. While prior work has used LLMs
within optimization loops or to generate non-BO algorithms, we tackle a new
challenge: Using LLMs to automatically generate full BO algorithm code. Our
framework uses an evolution strategy to guide an LLM in generating Python code
that preserves the key components of BO algorithms: An initial design, a
surrogate model, and an acquisition function. The LLM is prompted to produce
multiple candidate algorithms, which are evaluated on the established Black-Box
Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) test suite from the COmparing Continuous
Optimizers (COCO) platform. Based on their performance, top candidates are
selected, combined, and mutated via controlled prompt variations, enabling
iterative refinement. Despite no additional fine-tuning, the LLM-generated
algorithms outperform state-of-the-art BO baselines in 19 (out of 24) BBOB
functions in dimension 5 and generalize well to higher dimensions, and
different tasks (from the Bayesmark framework). This work demonstrates that
LLMs can serve as algorithmic co-designers, offering a new paradigm for
automating BO development and accelerating the discovery of novel algorithmic
combinations. The source code is provided at

Abstract: Model merging dramatically reduces storage and computational resources by
combining multiple expert models into a single multi-task model. Although
recent model merging methods have shown promising results, they struggle to
maintain performance gains as the number of merged models increases. In this
paper, we investigate the key obstacles that limit the scalability of model
merging when integrating a large number of expert models. First, we prove that
there is an upper bound on model merging. Further theoretical analysis reveals
that the limited effective parameter space imposes a strict constraint on the
number of models that can be successfully merged. Gaussian Width shows that the
marginal benefit of merging additional models diminishes according to a
strictly concave function. This implies that the effective parameter space
becomes rapidly saturated as the number of merged models increases.
Furthermore, using Approximate Kinematics Theory, we prove the existence of a
unique optimal threshold beyond which adding more models does not yield
significant performance improvements. At the same time, we introduce a
straightforward Reparameterized Heavy-Tailed method (RHT) to extend the
coverage of the merged model, thereby enhancing its performance. Empirical
results on 12 benchmarks, including both knowledge-intensive and
general-purpose tasks, validate our theoretical analysis. We believe that these
results spark further research beyond the current scope of model merging. The

Abstract: Despite the constant development of new bias mitigation methods for machine
learning, no method consistently succeeds, and a fundamental question remains
unanswered: when and why do bias mitigation techniques fail? In this paper, we
hypothesise that a key factor may be the often-overlooked but crucial step
shared by many bias mitigation methods: the definition of subgroups. To
investigate this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art
bias mitigation methods across multiple vision and language classification
tasks, systematically varying subgroup definitions, including coarse,
fine-grained, intersectional, and noisy subgroups. Our results reveal that
subgroup choice significantly impacts performance, with certain groupings
paradoxically leading to worse outcomes than no mitigation at all. Our findings
suggest that observing a disparity between a set of subgroups is not a
sufficient reason to use those subgroups for mitigation. Through theoretical
analysis, we explain these phenomena and uncover a counter-intuitive insight
that, in some cases, improving fairness with respect to a particular set of
subgroups is best achieved by using a different set of subgroups for
mitigation. Our work highlights the importance of careful subgroup definition
in bias mitigation and suggest it as a alternative lever for improving the
robustness and fairness of machine learning models.

Abstract: Distribution shifts introduce uncertainty that undermines the robustness and
generalization capabilities of machine learning models. While conventional
wisdom suggests that learning causal-invariant representations enhances
robustness to such shifts, recent empirical studies present a counterintuitive
finding: (i) empirical risk minimization (ERM) can rival or even outperform
state-of-the-art out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization methods, and (ii) its
OOD generalization performance improves when all available covariates, not just
causal ones, are utilized. Drawing on both empirical and theoretical evidence,
we attribute this phenomenon to hidden confounding. Shifts in hidden
confounding induce changes in data distributions that violate assumptions
commonly made by existing OOD generalization approaches. Under such conditions,
we prove that effective generalization requires learning environment-specific
relationships, rather than relying solely on invariant ones. Furthermore, we
show that models augmented with proxies for hidden confounders can mitigate the
challenges posed by hidden confounding shifts. These findings offer new
theoretical insights and practical guidance for designing robust OOD
generalization algorithms and principled covariate selection strategies.

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a widely used technique in Machine Learning and Deep
Learning (DL), known for its effectiveness in mitigating the impact of
heavy-tailed noise, which frequently arises in the training of large language
models. Additionally, first-order methods with clipping, such as Clip-SGD,
exhibit stronger convergence guarantees than SGD under the
$(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness assumption, a property observed in many DL tasks.
However, the high-probability convergence of Clip-SGD under both assumptions --
heavy-tailed noise and $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness -- has not been fully addressed
in the literature. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by establishing
the first high-probability convergence bounds for Clip-SGD applied to convex
$(L_0,L_1)$-smooth optimization with heavy-tailed noise. Our analysis extends
prior results by recovering known bounds for the deterministic case and the
stochastic setting with $L_1 = 0$ as special cases. Notably, our rates avoid
exponentially large factors and do not rely on restrictive sub-Gaussian noise
assumptions, significantly broadening the applicability of gradient clipping.

Abstract: Sometimes we benefit from actions that others have taken even when we are
unaware that they took those actions. For example, if your neighbor chooses not
to take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can
benefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These "hidden
gifts" represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others
are hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a
very simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have
individual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if
all the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward.
However, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective
reward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they
use it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents
have dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a "hidden
gift". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including
MARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this
simple task. Interestingly, we find that independent model-free policy gradient
agents can solve the task when we provide them with information about their own
action history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action
history. Finally, we derive a correction term for these independent agents,
inspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning
and helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results
show that credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly
challenging in the presence of "hidden gifts", and demonstrate that learning
awareness in independent agents can benefit these settings.

Abstract: Similar to other machine learning frameworks, Offline Reinforcement Learning

externally sourced datasets, a vulnerability that is exacerbated by its
sequential nature. To mitigate the risks posed by RL poisoning, we extend
certified defenses to provide larger guarantees against adversarial
manipulation, ensuring robustness for both per-state actions, and the overall
expected cumulative reward. Our approach leverages properties of Differential
Privacy, in a manner that allows this work to span both continuous and discrete
spaces, as well as stochastic and deterministic environments -- significantly
expanding the scope and applicability of achievable guarantees. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that our approach ensures the performance drops to no
more than $50\%$ with up to $7\%$ of the training data poisoned, significantly
improving over the $0.008\%$ in prior work~\citep{wu_copa_2022}, while
producing certified radii that is $5$ times larger as well. This highlights the
potential of our framework to enhance safety and reliability in offline RL.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the informational complexity of neural networks
is a central challenge in machine learning, with implications for
generalization, optimization, and model capacity. While most approaches rely on
entropy-based loss functions and statistical metrics, these measures often fail
to capture deeper, causally relevant algorithmic regularities embedded in
network structure. We propose a shift toward algorithmic information theory,
using Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) as a first proxy. Grounded in
algorithmic probability (AP) and the universal distribution it defines, our
approach characterizes learning dynamics through a formal, causally grounded
lens. We apply the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) -- a scalable approximation
of algorithmic complexity based on AP -- and demonstrate that it more closely
tracks structural changes during training than entropy, consistently exhibiting
stronger correlations with training loss across varying model sizes and
randomized training runs. These results support the view of training as a
process of algorithmic compression, where learning corresponds to the
progressive internalization of structured regularities. In doing so, our work
offers a principled estimate of learning progression and suggests a framework
for complexity-aware learning and regularization, grounded in first principles
from information theory, complexity, and computability.

Abstract: Inspired by the great success of Masked Language Modeling (MLM) in the
natural language domain, the paradigm of self-supervised pre-training and
fine-tuning has also achieved remarkable progress in the field of DNA sequence
modeling. However, previous methods often relied on massive pre-training data
or large-scale base models with huge parameters, imposing a significant
computational burden. To address this, many works attempted to use more compact
models to achieve similar outcomes but still fell short by a considerable
margin. In this work, we propose a Hybrid Architecture Distillation (HAD)
approach, leveraging both distillation and reconstruction tasks for more
efficient and effective pre-training. Specifically, we employ the NTv2-500M as
the teacher model and devise a grouping masking strategy to align the feature
embeddings of visible tokens while concurrently reconstructing the invisible
tokens during MLM pre-training. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method, we conducted comprehensive experiments on the Nucleotide Transformer
Benchmark and Genomic Benchmark. Compared to models with similar parameters,
our model achieved excellent performance. More surprisingly, it even surpassed
the distillation ceiling-teacher model on some sub-tasks, which is more than
500 $\times$ larger. Lastly, we utilize t-SNE for more intuitive visualization,
which shows that our model can gain a sophisticated understanding of the
intrinsic representation pattern in genomic sequences.

Abstract: Heuristic design with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising
approach for tackling combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However,
existing approaches often rely on manually predefined evolutionary computation
(EC) optimizers and single-task training schemes, which may constrain the
exploration of diverse heuristic algorithms and hinder the generalization of
the resulting heuristics. To address these issues, we propose Meta-Optimization
of Heuristics (MoH), a novel framework that operates at the optimizer level,
discovering effective optimizers through the principle of meta-learning.
Specifically, MoH leverages LLMs to iteratively refine a meta-optimizer that
autonomously constructs diverse optimizers through (self-)invocation, thereby
eliminating the reliance on a predefined EC optimizer. These constructed
optimizers subsequently evolve heuristics for downstream tasks, enabling
broader heuristic exploration. Moreover, MoH employs a multi-task training
scheme to promote its generalization capability. Experiments on classic COPs
demonstrate that MoH constructs an effective and interpretable meta-optimizer,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks,
particularly in cross-size settings.

Abstract: Adversarial samples exploit irregularities in the manifold ``learned'' by
deep learning models to cause misclassifications. The study of these
adversarial samples provides insight into the features a model uses to classify
inputs, which can be leveraged to improve robustness against future attacks.
However, much of the existing literature focuses on constrained adversarial
samples, which do not accurately reflect test-time errors encountered in
real-world settings. To address this, we propose `NatADiff', an adversarial
sampling scheme that leverages denoising diffusion to generate natural
adversarial samples. Our approach is based on the observation that natural
adversarial samples frequently contain structural elements from the adversarial
class. Deep learning models can exploit these structural elements to shortcut
the classification process, rather than learning to genuinely distinguish
between classes. To leverage this behavior, we guide the diffusion trajectory
towards the intersection of the true and adversarial classes, combining
time-travel sampling with augmented classifier guidance to enhance attack
transferability while preserving image fidelity. Our method achieves comparable
attack success rates to current state-of-the-art techniques, while exhibiting
significantly higher transferability across model architectures and better
alignment with natural test-time errors as measured by FID. These results
demonstrate that NatADiff produces adversarial samples that not only transfer
more effectively across models, but more faithfully resemble naturally
occurring test-time errors.

Abstract: Offline imitation learning typically learns from expert and unlabeled

undesirable behaviors. In this work, we study offline imitation learning from
contrasting behaviors, where the dataset contains both expert and undesirable
demonstrations. We propose a novel formulation that optimizes a difference of

undesirable (or bad) data. Although the resulting objective is a DC

demonstrations outweigh undesirable demonstrations, enabling a practical and

benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) systems have countless applications, from
energy-grid management to protein design. However, such real-world scenarios
are often extremely difficult, combinatorial in nature, and require complex
coordination between multiple agents. This level of complexity can cause even
state-of-the-art RL systems, trained until convergence, to hit a performance
ceiling which they are unable to break out of with zero-shot inference.
Meanwhile, many digital or simulation-based applications allow for an inference
phase that utilises a specific time and compute budget to explore multiple
attempts before outputting a final solution. In this work, we show that such an
inference phase employed at execution time, and the choice of a corresponding
inference strategy, are key to breaking the performance ceiling observed in
complex multi-agent RL problems. Our main result is striking: we can obtain up
to a 126% and, on average, a 45% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art
across 17 tasks, using only a couple seconds of extra wall-clock time during
execution. We also demonstrate promising compute scaling properties, supported
by over 60k experiments, making it the largest study on inference strategies

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以提升T2I模型的安全对齐而不损害其功能性。OVERT框架可灵活适应不同安全需求。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable success in generating
visual content from text inputs. Although multiple safety alignment strategies
have been proposed to prevent harmful outputs, they often lead to overly
cautious behavior -- rejecting even benign prompts -- a phenomenon known as
$\textit{over-refusal}$ that reduces the practical utility of T2I models.
Despite over-refusal having been observed in practice, there is no large-scale
benchmark that systematically evaluates this phenomenon for T2I models. In this
paper, we present an automatic workflow to construct synthetic evaluation data,
resulting in OVERT ($\textbf{OVE}$r-$\textbf{R}$efusal evaluation on
$\textbf{T}$ext-to-image models), the first large-scale benchmark for assessing
over-refusal behaviors in T2I models. OVERT includes 4,600 seemingly harmful
but benign prompts across nine safety-related categories, along with 1,785
genuinely harmful prompts (OVERT-unsafe) to evaluate the safety-utility
trade-off. Using OVERT, we evaluate several leading T2I models and find that
over-refusal is a widespread issue across various categories (Figure 1),
underscoring the need for further research to enhance the safety alignment of
T2I models without compromising their functionality.As a preliminary attempt to
reduce over-refusal, we explore prompt rewriting; however, we find it often
compromises faithfulness to the meaning of the original prompts. Finally, we
demonstrate the flexibility of our generation framework in accommodating
diverse safety requirements by generating customized evaluation data adapting
to user-defined policies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as effective surrogate
models and candidate generators within global optimization frameworks for
expensive blackbox functions. Despite promising results, LLM-based methods
often struggle in high-dimensional search spaces or when lacking
domain-specific priors, leading to sparse or uninformative suggestions. To
overcome these limitations, we propose HOLLM, a novel global optimization
algorithm that enhances LLM-driven sampling by partitioning the search space
into promising subregions. Each subregion acts as a ``meta-arm'' selected via a
bandit-inspired scoring mechanism that effectively balances exploration and
exploitation. Within each selected subregion, an LLM then proposes high-quality
candidate points, without any explicit domain knowledge. Empirical evaluation
on standard optimization benchmarks shows that HOLLM consistently matches or
surpasses leading Bayesian optimization and trust-region methods, while
substantially outperforming global LLM-based sampling strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modern generative
modeling, demonstrating strong potential for large language models (LLMs).
Unlike conventional autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens
sequentially, diffusion models enable parallel token sampling, leading to
faster generation and eliminating left-to-right generation constraints. Despite
their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of diffusion model
approaches remains underdeveloped. In this work, we develop convergence
guarantees for diffusion language models from an information-theoretic
perspective. Our analysis demonstrates that the sampling error, measured by the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, decays inversely with the number of
iterations $T$ and scales linearly with the mutual information between tokens
in the target text sequence. In particular, we establish matching upper and
lower bounds, up to some constant factor, to demonstrate the tightness of our
convergence analysis. These results offer novel theoretical insights into the
practical effectiveness of diffusion language models.

Abstract: A widely believed explanation for the remarkable generalization capacities of
overparameterized neural networks is that the optimization algorithms used for
training induce an implicit bias towards benign solutions. To grasp this
theoretically, recent works examine gradient descent and its variants in
simplified training settings, often assuming vanishing learning rates. These
studies reveal various forms of implicit regularization, such as $\ell_1$-norm
minimizing parameters in regression and max-margin solutions in classification.
Concurrently, empirical findings show that moderate to large learning rates
exceeding standard stability thresholds lead to faster, albeit oscillatory,
convergence in the so-called Edge-of-Stability regime, and induce an implicit
bias towards minima of low sharpness (norm of training loss Hessian). In this
work, we argue that a comprehensive understanding of the generalization
performance of gradient descent requires analyzing the interaction between
these various forms of implicit regularization. We empirically demonstrate that
the learning rate balances between low parameter norm and low sharpness of the
trained model. We furthermore prove for diagonal linear networks trained on a
simple regression task that neither implicit bias alone minimizes the
generalization error. These findings demonstrate that focusing on a single
implicit bias is insufficient to explain good generalization, and they motivate
a broader view of implicit regularization that captures the dynamic trade-off
between norm and sharpness induced by non-negligible learning rates.

Abstract: Generative modeling of time series is a central challenge in time series
analysis, particularly under data-scarce conditions. Despite recent advances in
generative modeling, a comprehensive understanding of how state-of-the-art
generative models perform under limited supervision remains lacking. In this
work, we conduct the first large-scale study evaluating leading generative
models in data-scarce settings, revealing a substantial performance gap between
full-data and data-scarce regimes. To close this gap, we propose a unified
diffusion-based generative framework that can synthesize high-fidelity time
series across diverse domains using just a few examples. Our model is
pre-trained on a large, heterogeneous collection of time series datasets,
enabling it to learn generalizable temporal representations. It further
incorporates architectural innovations such as dynamic convolutional layers for
flexible channel adaptation and dataset token conditioning for domain-aware
generation. Without requiring abundant supervision, our unified model achieves
state-of-the-art performance in few-shot settings-outperforming domain-specific
baselines across a wide range of subset sizes. Remarkably, it also surpasses
all baselines even when tested on full datasets benchmarks, highlighting the
strength of pre-training and cross-domain generalization. We hope this work
encourages the community to revisit few-shot generative modeling as a key
problem in time series research and pursue unified solutions that scale
efficiently across domains. Code is available at

Conclusion: RoMAE是一种通用且高效的方法，适用于多模态数据，无需专用架构。

Abstract: Applying Transformers to irregular time-series typically requires
specializations to their baseline architecture, which can result in additional
computational overhead and increased method complexity. We present the Rotary
Masked Autoencoder (RoMAE), which utilizes the popular Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) method for continuous positions. RoMAE is an extension to the
Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that enables representation learning with
multidimensional continuous positional information while avoiding any
time-series-specific architectural specializations. We showcase RoMAE's
performance on a variety of modalities including irregular and multivariate
time-series, images, and audio, demonstrating that RoMAE surpasses specialized
time-series architectures on difficult datasets such as the DESC ELAsTiCC
Challenge while maintaining MAE's usual performance across other modalities. In
addition, we investigate RoMAE's ability to reconstruct the embedded continuous
positions, demonstrating that including learned embeddings in the input
sequence breaks RoPE's relative position property.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在训练数据之外的数据上性能下降，概念漂移导致模型学习错误的表示，识别这些特征有助于理解数据集差异。

Method: 使用广义加性模型（GAM）建模概念漂移，结合特征选择，并引入knockoffs和吸收项以控制假发现和模型拟合不足。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上，SGShift的AUC>0.9，召回率>90%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SGShift能有效识别概念漂移特征，为模型性能下降提供解释。

Abstract: Regardless the amount of data a machine learning (ML) model is trained on,
there will inevitably be data that differs from their training set, lowering
model performance. Concept shift occurs when the distribution of labels
conditioned on the features changes, making even a well-tuned ML model to have
learned a fundamentally incorrect representation. Identifying these shifted
features provides unique insight into how one dataset differs from another,
considering the difference may be across a scientifically relevant dimension,
such as time, disease status, population, etc. In this paper, we propose
SGShift, a model for detecting concept shift in tabular data and attributing
reduced model performance to a sparse set of shifted features. SGShift models
concept shift with a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and performs subsequent
feature selection to identify shifted features. We propose further extensions
of SGShift by incorporating knockoffs to control false discoveries and an
absorption term to account for models with poor fit to the data. We conduct
extensive experiments in synthetic and real data across various ML models and
find SGShift can identify shifted features with AUC $>0.9$ and recall $>90\%$,
often 2 or 3 times as high as baseline methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the related problems of multicalibration -- a
multigroup fairness notion and omniprediction -- a simultaneous loss
minimization paradigm, both in the distributional and online settings. The
recent work of Garg et al. (2024) raised the open problem of whether it is
possible to efficiently achieve $O(\sqrt{T})$ $\ell_{2}$-multicalibration error
against bounded linear functions. In this paper, we answer this question in a
strongly affirmative sense. We propose an efficient algorithm that achieves
$O(T^{\frac{1}{3}})$ $\ell_{2}$-swap multicalibration error (both in high
probability and expectation). On propagating this bound onward, we obtain
significantly improved rates for $\ell_{1}$-swap multicalibration and swap
omniprediction for a loss class of convex Lipschitz functions. In particular,
we show that our algorithm achieves $O(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ $\ell_{1}$-swap
multicalibration and swap omniprediction errors, thereby improving upon the
previous best-known bound of $O(T^{\frac{7}{8}})$. As a consequence of our
improved online results, we further obtain several improved sample complexity
rates in the distributional setting. In particular, we establish a
$O(\varepsilon ^ {-3})$ sample complexity of efficiently learning an
$\varepsilon$-swap omnipredictor for the class of convex and Lipschitz
functions, $O(\varepsilon ^{-2.5})$ sample complexity of efficiently learning
an $\varepsilon$-swap agnostic learner for the squared loss, and $O(\varepsilon
^ {-5}), O(\varepsilon ^ {-2.5})$ sample complexities of learning $\ell_{1},
\ell_{2}$-swap multicalibrated predictors against linear functions, all of
which significantly improve on the previous best-known bounds.

Result: 该方法提升了网络的可训练性，促进梯度平滑流动和收敛到更平坦的极小值，泛化性和鲁棒性优于标准反向传播。

Conclusion: 简单的初始化策略可实现生物学合理且资源高效的深度网络学习。

Abstract: Backpropagation is the cornerstone of deep learning, but its reliance on
symmetric weight transport and global synchronization makes it computationally
expensive and biologically implausible. Feedback alignment offers a promising
alternative by approximating error gradients through fixed random feedback,
thereby avoiding symmetric weight transport. However, this approach often
struggles with poor learning performance and instability, especially in deep
networks. Here, we show that a one-time soft alignment between forward and
feedback weights at initialization enables deep networks to achieve performance
comparable to backpropagation, without requiring weight transport during
learning. This simple initialization condition guides stable error minimization
in the loss landscape, improving network trainability. Spectral analyses
further reveal that initial alignment promotes smoother gradient flow and
convergence to flatter minima, resulting in better generalization and
robustness. Notably, we also find that allowing moderate deviations from exact
weight symmetry can improve adversarial robustness compared to standard
backpropagation. These findings demonstrate that a simple initialization
strategy can enable effective learning in deep networks in a biologically
plausible and resource-efficient manner.

Abstract: In continual learning scenarios, catastrophic forgetting of previously
learned tasks is a critical issue, making it essential to effectively measure
such forgetting. Recently, there has been growing interest in focusing on
representation forgetting, the forgetting measured at the hidden layer. In this
paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of representation forgetting
and use this analysis to better understand the behavior of continual learning.
First, we introduce a new metric called representation discrepancy, which
measures the difference between representation spaces constructed by two
snapshots of a model trained through continual learning. We demonstrate that
our proposed metric serves as an effective surrogate for the representation
forgetting while remaining analytically tractable. Second, through mathematical
analysis of our metric, we derive several key findings about the dynamics of
representation forgetting: the forgetting occurs more rapidly to a higher
degree as the layer index increases, while increasing the width of the network
slows down the forgetting process. Third, we support our theoretical findings
through experiments on real image datasets, including Split-CIFAR100 and
ImageNet1K.

Result: 研究结果为改进对抗攻击算法提供了重要见解，推动了表格数据对抗机器学习的发展。

Conclusion: 新基准为表格数据对抗攻击研究提供了更全面的评估标准。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to machine learning models by
inducing incorrect predictions through imperceptible perturbations to input
data. While these attacks have been extensively studied in unstructured data
like images, their application to tabular data presents new challenges. These
challenges arise from the inherent heterogeneity and complex feature
interdependencies in tabular data, which differ significantly from those in
image data. To address these differences, it is crucial to consider
imperceptibility as a key criterion specific to tabular data. Most current
research focuses primarily on achieving effective adversarial attacks, often
overlooking the importance of maintaining imperceptibility. To address this
gap, we propose a new benchmark for adversarial attacks on tabular data that
evaluates both effectiveness and imperceptibility. In this study, we assess the
effectiveness and imperceptibility of five adversarial attacks across four
models using eleven tabular datasets, including both mixed and numerical-only
datasets. Our analysis explores how these factors interact and influence the
overall performance of the attacks. We also compare the results across
different dataset types to understand the broader implications of these
findings. The findings from this benchmark provide valuable insights for
improving the design of adversarial attack algorithms, thereby advancing the
field of adversarial machine learning on tabular data.

Conclusion: RPG-RT为评估和提升T2I模型的安全性提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models raise ethical and safety concerns due to their
potential to generate inappropriate or harmful images. Evaluating these models'
security through red-teaming is vital, yet white-box approaches are limited by
their need for internal access, complicating their use with closed-source
models. Moreover, existing black-box methods often assume knowledge about the
model's specific defense mechanisms, limiting their utility in real-world
commercial API scenarios. A significant challenge is how to evade unknown and
diverse defense mechanisms. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel
Rule-based Preference modeling Guided Red-Teaming (RPG-RT), which iteratively
employs LLM to modify prompts to query and leverages feedback from T2I systems
for fine-tuning the LLM. RPG-RT treats the feedback from each iteration as a
prior, enabling the LLM to dynamically adapt to unknown defense mechanisms.
Given that the feedback is often labeled and coarse-grained, making it
difficult to utilize directly, we further propose rule-based preference
modeling, which employs a set of rules to evaluate desired or undesired
feedback, facilitating finer-grained control over the LLM's dynamic adaptation
process. Extensive experiments on nineteen T2I systems with varied safety
mechanisms, three online commercial API services, and T2V models verify the
superiority and practicality of our approach.

Result: 在图像和文本到音频生成任务中，新方法显著优于传统CFG。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，论文提出的方法有效解决了CFG的局限性。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving
conditional diffusion models by linearly combining the outputs of conditional
and unconditional denoisers. While CFG enhances visual quality and improves
alignment with prompts, it often reduces sample diversity, leading to a
challenging trade-off between quality and diversity. To address this issue, we
make two key contributions. First, CFG generally does not correspond to a
well-defined denoising diffusion model (DDM). In particular, contrary to common
intuition, CFG does not yield samples from the target distribution associated
with the limiting CFG score as the noise level approaches zero -- where the
data distribution is tilted by a power $w \gt 1$ of the conditional
distribution. We identify the missing component: a R\'enyi divergence term that
acts as a repulsive force and is required to correct CFG and render it
consistent with a proper DDM. Our analysis shows that this correction term
vanishes in the low-noise limit. Second, motivated by this insight, we propose
a Gibbs-like sampling procedure to draw samples from the desired tilted
distribution. This method starts with an initial sample from the conditional
diffusion model without CFG and iteratively refines it, preserving diversity
while progressively enhancing sample quality. We evaluate our approach on both
image and text-to-audio generation tasks, demonstrating substantial
improvements over CFG across all considered metrics. The code is available at

Bencher can be deployed locally or remotely via Docker or on high-performance

setup and supports drop-in evaluation of 80 benchmarks across continuous,

Abstract: Linear TD($\lambda$) is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning

arbitrary features, we develop a novel stochastic approximation result

Abstract: Measuring task relatedness and mitigating negative transfer remain a critical
open challenge in Multitask Learning (MTL). This work extends data attribution
-- which quantifies the influence of individual training data points on model
predictions -- to MTL setting for measuring task relatedness. We propose the
MultiTask Influence Function (MTIF), a method that adapts influence functions
to MTL models with hard or soft parameter sharing. Compared to conventional
task relatedness measurements, MTIF provides a fine-grained, instance-level
relatedness measure beyond the entire-task level. This fine-grained relatedness
measure enables a data selection strategy to effectively mitigate negative
transfer in MTL. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the
proposed MTIF efficiently and accurately approximates the performance of models
trained on data subsets. Moreover, the data selection strategy enabled by MTIF
consistently improves model performance in MTL. Our work establishes a novel
connection between data attribution and MTL, offering an efficient and

Conclusion: STITCH-OPE通过扩散模型和轨迹拼接技术，显著提升了高维长时域OPE的性能。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) estimates the performance of a target policy
using offline data collected from a behavior policy, and is crucial in domains
such as robotics or healthcare where direct interaction with the environment is
costly or unsafe. Existing OPE methods are ineffective for high-dimensional,
long-horizon problems, due to exponential blow-ups in variance from importance
weighting or compounding errors from learned dynamics models. To address these
challenges, we propose STITCH-OPE, a model-based generative framework that
leverages denoising diffusion for long-horizon OPE in high-dimensional state
and action spaces. Starting with a diffusion model pre-trained on the behavior
data, STITCH-OPE generates synthetic trajectories from the target policy by
guiding the denoising process using the score function of the target policy.
STITCH-OPE proposes two technical innovations that make it advantageous for
OPE: (1) prevents over-regularization by subtracting the score of the behavior
policy during guidance, and (2) generates long-horizon trajectories by
stitching partial trajectories together end-to-end. We provide a theoretical
guarantee that under mild assumptions, these modifications result in an
exponential reduction in variance versus long-horizon trajectory diffusion.
Experiments on the D4RL and OpenAI Gym benchmarks show substantial improvement
in mean squared error, correlation, and regret metrics compared to
state-of-the-art OPE methods.

Abstract: While the performance of machine learning systems has experienced significant
improvement in recent years, relatively little attention has been paid to the
fundamental question: to what extent can we improve our models? This paper
provides a means of answering this question in the setting of binary
classification, which is practical and theoretically supported. We extend a
previous work that utilizes soft labels for estimating the Bayes error, the
optimal error rate, in two important ways. First, we theoretically investigate
the properties of the bias of the hard-label-based estimator discussed in the
original work. We reveal that the decay rate of the bias is adaptive to how
well the two class-conditional distributions are separated, and it can decay
significantly faster than the previous result suggested as the number of hard
labels per instance grows. Second, we tackle a more challenging problem
setting: estimation with corrupted soft labels. One might be tempted to use
calibrated soft labels instead of clean ones. However, we reveal that
calibration guarantee is not enough, that is, even perfectly calibrated soft
labels can result in a substantially inaccurate estimate. Then, we show that
isotonic calibration can provide a statistically consistent estimator under an
assumption weaker than that of the previous work. Our method is instance-free,
i.e., we do not assume access to any input instances. This feature allows it to
be adopted in practical scenarios where the instances are not available due to
privacy issues. Experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets show the
validity of our methods and theory.

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，UGCE显著提高了计算效率，同时保持高质量的解。

Conclusion: UGCE支持稳定性能，适应不同约束序列，并揭示了约束类型对搜索行为的影响。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) are a popular approach for interpreting
machine learning predictions by identifying minimal feature changes that alter
model outputs. However, in real-world settings, users often refine feasibility
constraints over time, requiring counterfactual generation to adapt
dynamically. Existing methods fail to support such iterative updates, instead
recomputing explanations from scratch with each change, an inefficient and
rigid approach. We propose User-Guided Incremental Counterfactual Exploration
(UGCE), a genetic algorithm-based framework that incrementally updates
counterfactuals in response to evolving user constraints. Experimental results
across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that UGCE significantly improves
computational efficiency while maintaining high-quality solutions compared to a
static, non-incremental approach. Our evaluation further shows that UGCE
supports stable performance under varying constraint sequences, benefits from
an efficient warm-start strategy, and reveals how different constraint types
may affect search behavior.

Conclusion: 高频滤波器模块有效缓解了扩散模型的固有缺陷，提升了MIA的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in image generation, but
they also raise significant concerns regarding privacy and copyright issues.
Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are designed to ascertain whether specific
data were utilized during a model's training phase. As current MIAs for
diffusion models typically exploit the model's image prediction ability, we
formalize them into a unified general paradigm which computes the membership
score for membership identification. Under this paradigm, we empirically find
that existing attacks overlook the inherent deficiency in how diffusion models
process high-frequency information. Consequently, this deficiency leads to
member data with more high-frequency content being misclassified as hold-out
data, and hold-out data with less high-frequency content tend to be
misclassified as member data. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that this
deficiency reduces the membership advantage of attacks, thereby interfering
with the effective discrimination of member data and hold-out data. Based on
this insight, we propose a plug-and-play high-frequency filter module to
mitigate the adverse effects of the deficiency, which can be seamlessly
integrated into any attacks within this general paradigm without additional
time costs. Extensive experiments corroborate that this module significantly
improves the performance of baseline attacks across different datasets and
models.

Abstract: Our examination of deep generative models (DGMs) developed for
semi-supervised learning (SSL), mainly GANs and VAEs, reveals two problems.
First, mode missing and mode covering phenomenons are observed in genertion
with GANs and VAEs. Second, there exists an awkward conflict between good
classification and good generation in SSL by employing directed generative
models. To address these problems, we formally present
joint-stochastic-approximation random fields (JRFs) -- a new family of
algorithms for building deep undirected generative models, with application to
SSL. It is found through synthetic experiments that JRFs work well in balancing
mode covering and mode missing, and match the empirical data distribution well.
Empirically, JRFs achieve good classification results comparable to the
state-of-art methods on widely adopted datasets -- MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 in
SSL, and simultaneously perform good generation.

Abstract: In recent years, while natural language processing and multimodal learning

proprietary datasets and evaluation rubrics, making fair comparisons between
different approaches challenging. Moreover, these methods often employ
evaluation metrics that capture only a subset of the desired properties of
designed proteins, lacking a comprehensive assessment framework. To address
these, we introduce PDFBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
de novo protein design from function. PDFBench supports two tasks:
description-guided design and keyword-guided design. To ensure fair and
multifaceted evaluation, we compile 22 metrics covering sequence plausibility,
structural fidelity, and language-protein alignment, along with measures of
novelty and diversity. We evaluate five state-of-the-art baselines, revealing
their respective strengths and weaknesses across tasks. Finally, we analyze
inter-metric correlations, exploring the relationships between four categories
of metrics, and offering guidelines for metric selection. PDFBench establishes
a unified framework to drive future advances in function-driven de novo protein

Result: FedProj在实验中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedProj通过新颖的机制有效解决了联邦学习中的全局决策边界遗忘问题。

Abstract: The inevitable presence of data heterogeneity has made federated learning
very challenging. There are numerous methods to deal with this issue, such as
local regularization, better model fusion techniques, and data sharing. Though
effective, they lack a deep understanding of how data heterogeneity can affect
the global decision boundary. In this paper, we bridge this gap by performing
an experimental analysis of the learned decision boundary using a toy example.
Our observations are surprising: (1) we find that the existing methods suffer
from forgetting and clients forget the global decision boundary and only learn
the perfect local one, and (2) this happens regardless of the initial weights,
and clients forget the global decision boundary even starting from pre-trained
optimal weights. In this paper, we present FedProj, a federated learning
framework that robustly learns the global decision boundary and avoids its
forgetting during local training. To achieve better ensemble knowledge fusion,
we design a novel server-side ensemble knowledge transfer loss to further
calibrate the learned global decision boundary. To alleviate the issue of
learned global decision boundary forgetting, we further propose leveraging an
episodic memory of average ensemble logits on a public unlabeled dataset to
regulate the gradient updates at each step of local training. Experimental
results demonstrate that FedProj outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a
large margin.

Result: 在六个基准问题上，PNODEs的平均约束违反误差低于10^-10，且运行时更低。

Conclusion: 约束投影是学习物理一致的长时程动力学的简单策略。

Abstract: Despite the promise of scientific machine learning (SciML) in combining
data-driven techniques with mechanistic modeling, existing approaches for
incorporating hard constraints in neural differential equations (NDEs) face
significant limitations. Scalability issues and poor numerical properties
prevent these neural models from being used for modeling physical systems with
complicated conservation laws. We propose Manifold-Projected Neural ODEs
(PNODEs), a method that explicitly enforces algebraic constraints by projecting
each ODE step onto the constraint manifold. This framework arises naturally
from semi-explicit differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), and includes both a
robust iterative variant and a fast approximation requiring a single Jacobian
factorization. We further demonstrate that prior works on relaxation methods
are special cases of our approach. PNODEs consistently outperform baselines
across six benchmark problems achieving a mean constraint violation error below
$10^{-10}$. Additionally, PNODEs consistently achieve lower runtime compared to
other methods for a given level of error tolerance. These results show that
constraint projection offers a simple strategy for learning physically
consistent long-horizon dynamics.

Result: ZeNNs在无限宽度限制下能点态收敛、保留非高斯特性并具备特征学习能力；有限宽度下在高频特征学习上表现优异。

Conclusion: ZeNNs成功解决了MLPs的缺陷，为神经网络架构设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a new simple architecture, Zeta Neural Networks (ZeNNs), in order
to overcome several shortcomings of standard multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).
Namely, in the large width limit, MLPs are non-parametric, they do not have a
well-defined pointwise limit, they lose non-Gaussian attributes and become
unable to perform feature learning; moreover, finite width MLPs perform poorly
in learning high frequencies. The new ZeNN architecture is inspired by three
simple principles from harmonic analysis:
  i) Enumerate the perceptons and introduce a non-learnable weight to enforce
convergence;
  ii) Introduce a scaling (or frequency) factor;
  iii) Choose activation functions that lead to near orthogonal systems.
  We will show that these ideas allow us to fix the referred shortcomings of
MLPs. In fact, in the infinite width limit, ZeNNs converge pointwise, they
exhibit a rich asymptotic structure beyond Gaussianity, and perform feature
learning. Moreover, when appropriate activation functions are chosen, (finite
width) ZeNNs excel at learning high-frequency features of functions with low
dimensional domains.

Abstract: Designing regulatory DNA sequences that achieve precise cell-type-specific
gene expression is crucial for advancements in synthetic biology, gene therapy
and precision medicine. Although transformer-based language models (LMs) can
effectively capture patterns in regulatory DNA, their generative approaches
often struggle to produce novel sequences with reliable cell-specific activity.
Here, we introduce Ctrl-DNA, a novel constrained reinforcement learning (RL)
framework tailored for designing regulatory DNA sequences with controllable
cell-type specificity. By formulating regulatory sequence design as a
biologically informed constrained optimization problem, we apply RL to
autoregressive genomic LMs, enabling the models to iteratively refine sequences
that maximize regulatory activity in targeted cell types while constraining
off-target effects. Our evaluation on human promoters and enhancers
demonstrates that Ctrl-DNA consistently outperforms existing generative and
RL-based approaches, generating high-fitness regulatory sequences and achieving
state-of-the-art cell-type specificity. Moreover, Ctrl-DNA-generated sequences
capture key cell-type-specific transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), short
DNA motifs recognized by regulatory proteins that control gene expression,
demonstrating the biological plausibility of the generated sequences.

Abstract: The diverse nature of protein prediction tasks has traditionally necessitated

converting a wide spectrum of protein-related predictions, from sequence-level
properties and residue-specific attributes to complex inter-protein

Prot2Token employs an autoregressive decoder, conditioned on embeddings from
pre-trained protein encoders and guided by learnable task tokens, to perform
diverse predictions. This architecture uniquely facilitates multi-task
learning, enabling a single model to master numerous tasks with improved
efficiency. We present extensive experimental validation across a variety of
benchmarks, demonstrating Prot2Tokens strong predictive power in different
types of protein-prediction tasks. Key results include significant speedups
(e.g., near 1000x over AlphaFold2 with MSA) and performance often matching or
exceeding specialized approaches. Beyond that, we introduce an auxiliary
self-supervised decoder pre-training approach to improve spatially sensitive
task performance. Prot2Token thus offers a significant step towards a
versatile, high-throughput paradigm for protein modeling, promising to
accelerate biological discovery and the development of novel therapeutics. The

Conclusion: PHN-HVVS是一种高效的PFL框架，适用于高维空间中的多目标优化问题。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) exists extensively in machine learning,
and aims to find a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, called the Pareto front,
e.g., it is fundamental for multiple avenues of research in federated learning
(FL). Pareto-Front Learning (PFL) is a powerful method implemented using
Hypernetworks (PHNs) to approximate the Pareto front. This method enables the
acquisition of a mapping function from a given preference vector to the
solutions on the Pareto front. However, most existing PFL approaches still face
two challenges: (a) sampling rays in high-dimensional spaces; (b) failing to
cover the entire Pareto Front which has a convex shape. Here, we introduce a
novel PFL framework, called as PHN-HVVS, which decomposes the design space into
Voronoi grids and deploys a genetic algorithm (GA) for Voronoi grid
partitioning within high-dimensional space. We put forward a new loss function,
which effectively contributes to more extensive coverage of the resultant
Pareto front and maximizes the HV Indicator. Experimental results on multiple
MOO machine learning tasks demonstrate that PHN-HVVS outperforms the baselines
significantly in generating Pareto front. Also, we illustrate that PHN-HVVS
advances the methodologies of several recent problems in the FL field. The code

Conclusion: EDALSSC通过有效的不确定性估计和样本选择策略，提升了半监督分类的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised classification based on active learning has made significant
progress, but the existing methods often ignore the uncertainty estimation (or
reliability) of the prediction results during the learning process, which makes
it questionable whether the selected samples can effectively update the model.
Hence, this paper proposes an evidential deep active learning approach for
semi-supervised classification (EDALSSC). EDALSSC builds a semi-supervised
learning framework to simultaneously quantify the uncertainty estimation of
labeled and unlabeled data during the learning process. The uncertainty
estimation of the former is associated with evidential deep learning, while
that of the latter is modeled by combining ignorance information and conflict
information of the evidence from the perspective of the T-conorm operator.
Furthermore, this article constructs a heuristic method to dynamically balance
the influence of evidence and the number of classes on uncertainty estimation
to ensure that it does not produce counter-intuitive results in EDALSSC. For
the sample selection strategy, EDALSSC selects the sample with the greatest
uncertainty estimation that is calculated in the form of a sum when the
training loss increases in the latter half of the learning process.
Experimental results demonstrate that EDALSSC outperforms existing
semi-supervised and supervised active learning approaches on image
classification datasets.

Abstract: The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience
by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various
phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses
from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are
static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic,
state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt
dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict
relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We
propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted
superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear
relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying
interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves
f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average
over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well
over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to
uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning solution
operators of partial differential equations. However, in time-dependent
problems, standard training strategies such as teacher forcing introduce a
mismatch between training and inference, leading to compounding errors in
long-term autoregressive predictions. To address this issue, we propose
Recurrent Neural Operators (RNOs)-a novel framework that integrates recurrent
training into neural operator architectures. Instead of conditioning each
training step on ground-truth inputs, RNOs recursively apply the operator to
their own predictions over a temporal window, effectively simulating
inference-time dynamics during training. This alignment mitigates exposure bias
and enhances robustness to error accumulation. Theoretically, we show that
recurrent training can reduce the worst-case exponential error growth typical
of teacher forcing to linear growth. Empirically, we demonstrate that
recurrently trained Multigrid Neural Operators significantly outperform their
teacher-forced counterparts in long-term accuracy and stability on standard
benchmarks. Our results underscore the importance of aligning training with
inference dynamics for robust temporal generalization in neural operator
learning.

Abstract: Efficient maintenance has always been essential for the successful
application of engineering systems. However, the challenges to be overcome in
the implementation of Industry 4.0 necessitate new paradigms of maintenance
optimization. Machine learning techniques are becoming increasingly used in
engineering and maintenance, with reinforcement learning being one of the most
promising. In this paper, we propose a gamma degradation process together with
a novel maintenance model in which repairs are increasingly imperfect, i.e.,
the beneficial effect of system repairs decreases as more repairs are
performed, reflecting the degradational behavior of real-world systems. To
generate maintenance policies for this system, we developed a
reinforcement-learning-based agent using a Double Deep Q-Network architecture.
This agent presents two important advantages: it works without a predefined
preventive threshold, and it can operate in a continuous degradation state
space. Our agent learns to behave in different scenarios, showing great
flexibility. In addition, we performed an analysis of how changes in the main
parameters of the environment affect the maintenance policy proposed by the
agent. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be appropriate and to
significatively improve long-run cost as compared with other common maintenance
strategies.

Conclusion: 改进的ActionFormer在传感器信号HAR中表现更优，且参数增加较少。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has recently witnessed advancements with
Transformer-based models. Especially, ActionFormer shows us a new perspectives
for HAR in the sense that this approach gives us additional outputs which
detect the border of the activities as well as the activity labels.
ActionFormer was originally proposed with its input as image/video. However,
this was converted to with its input as sensor signals as well. We analyze this
extensively in terms of deep learning architectures. Based on the report of
high temporal dynamics which limits the model's ability to capture subtle
changes effectively and of the interdependencies between the spatial and
temporal features. We propose the modified ActionFormer which will decrease
these defects for sensor signals. The key to our approach lies in accordance
with the Sequence-and-Excitation strategy to minimize the increase in
additional parameters and opt for the swish activation function to retain the
information about direction in the negative range. Experiments on the WEAR
dataset show that our method achieves substantial improvement of a 16.01\% in
terms of average mAP for inertial data.

TL;DR: TimePro是一种基于Mamba的创新模型，用于解决长期时间序列预测中的多延迟问题，通过构建变量和时间感知的超状态来提高预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型在处理多变量时间序列时无法有效捕捉复杂变量关系和非平凡时间表示，因此需要一种新方法来感知变量关系和显著时间信息。

Method: TimePro通过保留每个变量标记的细粒度时间特征，并自适应选择关注的时间点来调整普通状态，构建变量和时间感知的超状态。

Result: 在八个真实世界的长期预测基准测试中，TimePro表现出色，具有令人满意的线性复杂度。

Conclusion: TimePro通过感知变量关系和时间信息，显著提高了长期时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: In long-term time series forecasting, different variables often influence the
target variable over distinct time intervals, a challenge known as the
multi-delay issue. Traditional models typically process all variables or time
points uniformly, which limits their ability to capture complex variable
relationships and obtain non-trivial time representations. To address this
issue, we propose TimePro, an innovative Mamba-based model that constructs
variate- and time-aware hyper-states. Unlike conventional approaches that
merely transfer plain states across variable or time dimensions, TimePro
preserves the fine-grained temporal features of each variate token and
adaptively selects the focused time points to tune the plain state. The
reconstructed hyper-state can perceive both variable relationships and salient
temporal information, which helps the model make accurate forecasting. In
experiments, TimePro performs competitively on eight real-world long-term
forecasting benchmarks with satisfactory linear complexity. Code is available

Conclusion: ClustGDD是一种高效且有效的图数据蒸馏方法，显著提升了GNN训练效率。

Abstract: Despite plentiful successes achieved by graph representation learning in
various domains, the training of graph neural networks (GNNs) still remains
tenaciously challenging due to the tremendous computational overhead needed for
sizable graphs in practice. Recently, graph data distillation (GDD), which
seeks to distill large graphs into compact and informative ones, has emerged as
a promising technique to enable efficient GNN training. However, most existing
GDD works rely on heuristics that align model gradients or representation
distributions on condensed and original graphs, leading to compromised result
quality, expensive training for distilling large graphs, or both. Motivated by
this, this paper presents an efficient and effective GDD approach, ClustGDD.
Under the hood, ClustGDD resorts to synthesizing the condensed graph and node
attributes through fast and theoretically-grounded clustering that minimizes
the within-cluster sum of squares and maximizes the homophily on the original
graph. The fundamental idea is inspired by our empirical and theoretical
findings unveiling the connection between clustering and empirical condensation
quality using Fr\'echet Inception Distance, a well-known quality metric for
synthetic images. Furthermore, to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the
homophily-based clustering, ClustGDD refines the nodal attributes of the
condensed graph with a small augmentation learned via class-aware graph
sampling and consistency loss. Our extensive experiments exhibit that GNNs
trained over condensed graphs output by ClustGDD consistently achieve superior
or comparable performance to state-of-the-art GDD methods in terms of node
classification on five benchmark datasets, while being orders of magnitude
faster.

Abstract: We revisit DropEdge, a data augmentation technique for GNNs which randomly
removes edges to expose diverse graph structures during training. While being a
promising approach to effectively reduce overfitting on specific connections in
the graph, we observe that its potential performance gain in supervised
learning tasks is significantly limited. To understand why, we provide a
theoretical analysis showing that the limited performance of DropEdge comes
from the fundamental limitation that exists in many GNN architectures. Based on
this analysis, we propose Aggregation Buffer, a parameter block specifically
designed to improve the robustness of GNNs by addressing the limitation of
DropEdge. Our method is compatible with any GNN model, and shows consistent
performance improvements on multiple datasets. Moreover, our method effectively

Abstract: Fusing heterogeneous information remains a persistent challenge in modern

often fail to account for the inherent heterogeneity of object patterns across
different semantic spaces. To address this limitation, we propose the
Cooperation of Experts (CoE) framework, which encodes multi-typed information

connection differences, CoE provides a powerful and flexible model for
capturing the intricate structures of real-world complex data. In our
framework, dedicated encoders act as domain-specific experts, each specializing
in learning distinct relational patterns in specific semantic spaces. To
enhance robustness and extract complementary knowledge, these experts
collaborate through a novel large margin mechanism supported by a tailored
optimization strategy. Rigorous theoretical analyses guarantee the framework's
feasibility and stability, while extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and broad applicability. Our

Conclusion: Fedivertex为去中心化机器学习提供了更真实的基准测试数据。

Abstract: Decentralized machine learning - where each client keeps its own data locally
and uses its own computational resources to collaboratively train a model by
exchanging peer-to-peer messages - is increasingly popular, as it enables
better scalability and control over the data. A major challenge in this setting
is that learning dynamics depend on the topology of the communication graph,
which motivates the use of real graph datasets for benchmarking decentralized
algorithms. Unfortunately, existing graph datasets are largely limited to
for-profit social networks crawled at a fixed point in time and often collected
at the user scale, where links are heavily influenced by the platform and its
recommendation algorithms. The Fediverse, which includes several free and
open-source decentralized social media platforms such as Mastodon, Misskey, and
Lemmy, offers an interesting real-world alternative. We introduce Fedivertex, a
new dataset of 182 graphs, covering seven social networks from the Fediverse,
crawled weekly over 14 weeks. We release the dataset along with a Python
package to facilitate its use, and illustrate its utility on several tasks,
including a new defederation task, which captures a process of link deletion
observed on these networks.

Motivation: 传统HAR方法依赖滑动窗口分割数据，限制了可学习的时间上下文信息。论文旨在通过建模窗口内和窗口间的时间模式来提升性能。

Result: 在六个广泛使用的HAR基准测试中，平均F1分数比经典DeepConvLSTM提高10%，最高提升21%。

Conclusion: LSTM在建模惯性传感器数据方面优于注意力机制，DeepConvContext显著提升了HAR性能。

Abstract: Despite recognized limitations in modeling long-range temporal dependencies,
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has traditionally relied on a sliding window
approach to segment labeled datasets. Deep learning models like the
DeepConvLSTM typically classify each window independently, thereby restricting
learnable temporal context to within-window information. To address this
constraint, we propose DeepConvContext, a multi-scale time series
classification framework for HAR. Drawing inspiration from the vision-based
Temporal Action Localization community, DeepConvContext models both intra- and
inter-window temporal patterns by processing sequences of time-ordered windows.
Unlike recent HAR models that incorporate attention mechanisms, DeepConvContext
relies solely on LSTMs -- with ablation studies demonstrating the superior
performance of LSTMs over attention-based variants for modeling inertial sensor
data. Across six widely-used HAR benchmarks, DeepConvContext achieves an
average 10% improvement in F1-score over the classic DeepConvLSTM, with gains
of up to 21%. Code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

Abstract: While prior work has shown that Federated Learning updates can leak sensitive
information, label reconstruction attacks, which aim to recover input labels
from shared gradients, have not yet been examined in the context of Human
Activity Recognition (HAR). Given the sensitive nature of activity labels, this
study evaluates the effectiveness of state-of-the-art gradient-based label
leakage attacks on HAR benchmark datasets. Our findings show that the number of
activity classes, sampling strategy, and class imbalance are critical factors
influencing the extent of label leakage, with reconstruction accuracies
reaching up to 90% on two benchmark datasets, even for trained models.
Moreover, we find that Local Differential Privacy techniques such as gradient
noise and clipping offer only limited protection, as certain attacks still
reliably infer both majority and minority class labels. We conclude by offering
practical recommendations for the privacy-aware deployment of federated HAR
systems and identify open challenges for future research. Code to reproduce our
experiments is publicly available via github.com/mariusbock/leakage_har.

meaningful world models from raw sensorimotor data; Compositionality, providing
the algebraic tools to combine learned concepts and subsystems; and Emergent
Communication, allowing intelligent agents to create their own adaptive and

truly intelligent systems that can reason, adapt, and collaborate, unifying
advances in wireless communications, machine learning, and robotics under a

Abstract: Along with AI computing shining in scientific discovery, its potential in the

(OH-PUBO), a formulation for modeling k-grouping problems on graphs and
hypergraphs (e.g., graph/hypergraph coloring and partitioning); GPU-accelerated
algorithms for large-scale k-grouping CO problems. Deep $k$-grouping employs
the relaxation of large-scale OH-PUBO objectives as differentiable loss
functions and trains to optimize them in an unsupervised manner. To ensure
scalability, it leverages GPU-accelerated algorithms to unify the training
pipeline; A Gini coefficient-based continuous relaxation annealing strategy to
enforce discreteness of solutions while preventing convergence to local optima.
Experimental results demonstrate that Deep $k$-grouping outperforms existing
neural network solvers and classical heuristics such as SCIP and Tabu.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs), which capture graph structures via a feature
aggregation mechanism following the graph embedding framework, have
demonstrated a powerful ability to support various tasks. According to the
topology properties (e.g., structural roles or community memberships of nodes)
to be preserved, graph embedding can be categorized into identity and position
embedding. However, it is unclear for most GNN-based methods which property
they can capture. Some of them may also suffer from low efficiency and
scalability caused by several time- and space-consuming procedures (e.g.,
feature extraction and training). From a perspective of graph signal
processing, we find that high- and low-frequency information in the graph
spectral domain may characterize node identities and positions, respectively.
Based on this investigation, we propose random feature aggregation (RFA) for
efficient identity and position embedding, serving as an extreme ablation study
regarding GNN feature aggregation. RFA (i) adopts a spectral-based GNN without
learnable parameters as its backbone, (ii) only uses random noises as inputs,
and (iii) derives embeddings via just one feed-forward propagation (FFP).
Inspired by degree-corrected spectral clustering, we further introduce a degree
correction mechanism to the GNN backbone. Surprisingly, our experiments
demonstrate that two variants of RFA with high- and low-pass filters can
respectively derive informative identity and position embeddings via just one
FFP (i.e., without any training). As a result, RFA can achieve a better
trade-off between quality and efficiency for both identity and position
embedding over various baselines.

Abstract: Binary (0-1) integer programming (BIP) is pivotal in scientific domains
requiring discrete decision-making. As the advance of AI computing, recent
works explore neural network-based solvers for integer linear programming (ILP)
problems. Yet, they lack scalability for tackling nonlinear challenges. To
handle nonlinearities, state-of-the-art Branch-and-Cut solvers employ linear
relaxations, leading to exponential growth in auxiliary variables and severe
computation limitations. To overcome these limitations, we propose BIPNN
(Binary Integer Programming Neural Network), an unsupervised learning framework
to solve nonlinear BIP problems via hypergraph neural networks (HyperGNN).
Specifically, BIPNN reformulates BIPs-constrained, discrete, and nonlinear
(sin, log, exp) optimization problems-into unconstrained, differentiable, and
polynomial loss functions. The reformulation stems from the observation of a
precise one-to-one mapping between polynomial BIP objectives and hypergraph
structures, enabling the unsupervised training of HyperGNN to optimize BIP
problems in an end-to-end manner. On this basis, we propose a GPU-accelerated
and continuous-annealing-enhanced training pipeline for BIPNN. The pipeline
enables BIPNN to optimize large-scale nonlinear terms in BIPs fully in parallel
via straightforward gradient descent, thus significantly reducing the training
cost while ensuring the generation of discrete, high-quality solutions.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets highlight the
superiority of our approach.

Conclusion: VT-DIS是一种高效且计算成本低的方法，适用于Boltzmann分布的无偏采样。

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) are powerful amortized samplers for
Boltzmann distributions; however, imperfect score estimates bias downstream
Monte Carlo estimates. Classical importance sampling (IS) can correct this
bias, but computing exact likelihoods requires solving the probability-flow
ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE), a procedure that is prohibitively
costly and scales poorly with dimensionality. We introduce Variance-Tuned
Diffusion Importance Sampling (VT-DIS), a lightweight post-training method that
adapts the per-step noise covariance of a pretrained SBDM by minimizing the
$\alpha$-divergence ($\alpha=2$) between its forward diffusion and reverse
denoising trajectories. VT-DIS assigns a single trajectory-wise importance
weight to the joint forward-reverse process, yielding unbiased expectation
estimates at test time with negligible overhead compared to standard sampling.
On the DW-4, LJ-13, and alanine-dipeptide benchmarks, VT-DIS achieves effective
sample sizes of approximately 80 %, 35 %, and 3.5 %, respectively, while using
only a fraction of the computational budget required by vanilla diffusion + IS
or PF-ODE-based IS.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular framework for constructing prediction
bands with valid coverage in finite samples, while being free of any
distributional assumption. A well-known limitation of conformal prediction is
the lack of adaptivity, although several works introduced practically efficient
alternate procedures. In this work, we build upon recent ideas that rely on
recasting the CP problem as a statistical learning problem, directly targeting
coverage and adaptivity. This statistical learning problem is based on
reproducible kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and kernel sum-of-squares (SoS)
methods. First, we extend previous results with a general representer theorem
and exhibit the dual formulation of the learning problem. Crucially, such dual
formulation can be solved efficiently by accelerated gradient methods with
several hundreds or thousands of samples, unlike previous strategies based on
off-the-shelf semidefinite programming algorithms. Second, we introduce a new
hyperparameter tuning strategy tailored specifically to target adaptivity
through bounds on test-conditional coverage. This strategy, based on the
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), is introduced here to tune
kernel lengthscales in our framework, but has broader applicability since it
could be used in any CP algorithm where the score function is learned. Finally,
extensive experiments are conducted to show how our method compares to related
work. All figures can be reproduced with the accompanying code.

Abstract: Digital twins offer a promising solution to the lack of sufficient labeled
data in deep learning-based fault diagnosis by generating simulated data for
model training. However, discrepancies between simulation and real-world
systems can lead to a significant drop in performance when models are applied
in real scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a fault diagnosis
framework based on Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN), which enables
knowledge transfer from simulated (source domain) to real-world (target domain)
data. We evaluate the proposed framework using a publicly available robotics
fault diagnosis dataset, which includes 3,600 sequences generated by a digital
twin model and 90 real sequences collected from physical systems. The DANN
method is compared with commonly used lightweight deep learning models such as
CNN, TCN, Transformer, and LSTM. Experimental results show that incorporating
domain adaptation significantly improves the diagnostic performance. For
example, applying DANN to a baseline CNN model improves its accuracy from
70.00% to 80.22% on real-world test data, demonstrating the effectiveness of
domain adaptation in bridging the sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: Trees and the associated shortest-path tree metrics provide a powerful
framework for representing hierarchical and combinatorial structures in data.
Given an arbitrary metric space, its deviation from a tree metric can be
quantified by Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity. Nonetheless, designing
algorithms that bridge an arbitrary metric to its closest tree metric is still
a vivid subject of interest, as most common approaches are either heuristical
and lack guarantees, or perform moderately well. In this work, we introduce a
novel differentiable optimization framework, coined DeltaZero, that solves this
problem. Our method leverages a smooth surrogate for Gromov's
$\delta$-hyperbolicity which enables a gradient-based optimization, with a
tractable complexity. The corresponding optimization procedure is derived from
a problem with better worst case guarantees than existing bounds, and is
justified statistically. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art distortion.

Motivation: 在线学习需要适应未知问题特性（如梯度变化、函数曲率和梯度尺度），但现有算法因次优性无法同时实现最优性能。

Method: 设计了一种乐观在线镜像下降算法，通过辅助初始轮次和大学习率，优化分析并消除额外因子。

Result: 新算法首次同时实现了最优梯度变化和Lipschitz适应性，解决了先前工作的关键限制。

Conclusion: 该算法解决了在线学习中的不可能调优问题，为通用在线学习提供了新方法。

Abstract: A central goal in online learning is to achieve adaptivity to unknown problem
characteristics, such as environmental changes captured by gradient variation
(GV), function curvature (universal online learning, UOL), and gradient scales
(Lipschitz adaptivity, LA). Simultaneously achieving these with optimal
performance is a major challenge, partly due to limitations in algorithms for
prediction with expert advice. These algorithms often serve as meta-algorithms
in online ensemble frameworks, and their sub-optimality hinders overall UOL
performance. Specifically, existing algorithms addressing the ``impossible
tuning'' issue incur an excess $\sqrt{\log T}$ factor in their regret bound
compared to the lower bound. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
optimistic online mirror descent algorithm with an auxiliary initial round
using large learning rates. This design enables a refined analysis where a
generated negative term cancels the gap-related factor, resolving the
impossible tuning issue up to $\log\log T$ factors. Leveraging our improved
algorithm as a meta-algorithm, we develop the first UOL algorithm that
simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art GV bounds and LA under standard
assumptions. Our UOL result overcomes key limitations of prior works, notably
resolving the conflict between LA mechanisms and regret analysis for GV bounds
-- an open problem highlighted by Xie et al.

Result: RCaGP在干净和异常值污染的数据集上均表现优异，提供了更保守和可靠的估计。

Conclusion: 联合解决鲁棒性和近似问题优于单独处理，RCaGP为回归和贝叶斯优化任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and optimization
tasks such as Bayesian optimization (BO) due to their expressiveness and
principled uncertainty estimates. However, in settings with large datasets
corrupted by outliers, standard GPs and their sparse approximations struggle
with computational tractability and robustness. We introduce Robust
Computation-aware Gaussian Process (RCaGP), a novel GP model that jointly
addresses these challenges by combining a principled treatment of
approximation-induced uncertainty with robust generalized Bayesian updating.
The key insight is that robustness and approximation-awareness are not
orthogonal but intertwined: approximations can exacerbate the impact of
outliers, and mitigating one without the other is insufficient. Unlike previous
work that focuses narrowly on either robustness or approximation quality, RCaGP
combines both in a principled and scalable framework, thus effectively managing
both outliers and computational uncertainties introduced by approximations such
as low-rank matrix multiplications. Our model ensures more conservative and
reliable uncertainty estimates, a property we rigorously demonstrate.
Additionally, we establish a robustness property and show that the mean
function is key to preserving it, motivating a tailored model selection scheme
for robust mean functions. Empirical results confirm that solving these
challenges jointly leads to superior performance across both clean and
outlier-contaminated settings, both on regression and high-throughput Bayesian
optimization benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法为非线性测量模型中的信号恢复提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated remarkable ability to generate
diverse and high-quality images by efficiently modeling complex data
distributions. They have also been explored as powerful generative priors for
signal recovery, resulting in a substantial improvement in the quality of
reconstructed signals. However, existing research on signal recovery with
diffusion models either focuses on specific reconstruction problems or is
unable to handle nonlinear measurement models with discontinuous or unknown
link functions. In this work, we focus on using DMs to achieve accurate
recovery from semi-parametric single index models, which encompass a variety of
popular nonlinear models that may have {\em discontinuous} and {\em unknown}
link functions. We propose an efficient reconstruction method that only
requires one round of unconditional sampling and (partial) inversion of DMs.
Theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed methods has been
established under appropriate conditions. We perform numerical experiments on
image datasets for different nonlinear measurement models. We observe that
compared to competing methods, our approach can yield more accurate
reconstructions while utilizing significantly fewer neural function
evaluations.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have recently drawn increasing
attention for modeling complex multi-relational data in domains such as
recommendation, finance, and social networks. While existing research has been
largely focused on enhancing HGNNs' predictive performance, their robustness
and security, especially under backdoor attacks, remain underexplored. In this
paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Backdoor Attack (HeteroBA) framework
for node classification tasks on heterogeneous graphs. HeteroBA inserts
carefully crafted trigger nodes with realistic features and targeted structural
connections, leveraging attention-based and clustering-based strategies to
select influential auxiliary nodes for effective trigger propagation, thereby
causing the model to misclassify specific nodes into a target label while
maintaining accuracy on clean data. Experimental results on three datasets and
various HGNN architectures demonstrate that HeteroBA achieves high attack
success rates with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Our method sheds light
on potential vulnerabilities in HGNNs and calls for more robust defenses
against backdoor threats in multi-relational graph scenarios.

Conclusion: SemiCP通过半监督校准改进了CP在标记数据有限场景下的性能，具有理论和实验支持。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for uncertainty
quantification, providing prediction sets with coverage guarantees when
calibrated on sufficient labeled data. However, in real-world applications
where labeled data is often limited, standard CP can lead to coverage deviation
and output overly large prediction sets. In this paper, we extend CP to the
semi-supervised setting and propose SemiCP, leveraging both labeled data and
unlabeled data for calibration. Specifically, we introduce a novel
nonconformity score function, NNM, designed for unlabeled data. This function
selects labeled data with similar pseudo-label scores to estimate nonconformity
scores, integrating them into the calibration process to overcome sample size
limitations. We theoretically demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, SemiCP
provide asymptotically coverage guarantee for prediction sets. Extensive
experiments further validate that our approach effectively reduces instability
and inefficiency under limited calibration data, can be adapted to conditional
coverage settings, and integrates seamlessly with existing CP methods.

Conclusion: LLDG能有效建模标签空间的不确定性并生成准确的标签分布。

Abstract: Although \textbf{L}abel \textbf{D}istribution \textbf{L}earning (LDL) has
promising representation capabilities for characterizing the polysemy of an
instance, the complexity and high cost of the label distribution annotation
lead to inexact in the construction of the label space. The existence of a
large number of inexact labels generates a label space with uncertainty, which
misleads the LDL algorithm to yield incorrect decisions. To alleviate this
problem, we model the uncertainty of label distributions by constructing a
\textbf{L}atent \textbf{L}abel \textbf{D}istribution \textbf{G}rid (LLDG) to
form a low-noise representation space. Specifically, we first construct a label
correlation matrix based on the differences between labels, and then expand
each value of the matrix into a vector that obeys a Gaussian distribution, thus
building a LLDG to model the uncertainty of the label space. Finally, the LLDG
is reconstructed by the LLDG-Mixer to generate an accurate label distribution.
Note that we enforce a customized low-rank scheme on this grid, which assumes
that the label relations may be noisy and it needs to perform noise-reduction
with the help of a Tucker reconstruction technique. Furthermore, we attempt to
evaluate the effectiveness of the LLDG by considering its generation as an
upstream task to achieve the classification of the objects. Extensive
experimental results show that our approach performs competitively on several
benchmarks.

Conclusion: pTMEnergy和BECraft为蛋白质结合剂设计提供了更高效的统计能量框架，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Protein binder design has been transformed by hallucination-based methods
that optimize structure prediction confidence metrics, such as the interface
predicted TM-score (ipTM), via backpropagation. However, these metrics do not
reflect the statistical likelihood of a binder-target complex under the learned
distribution and yield sparse gradients for optimization. In this work, we
propose a method to extract such likelihoods from structure predictors by
reinterpreting their confidence outputs as an energy-based model (EBM). By
leveraging the Joint Energy-based Modeling (JEM) framework, we introduce
pTMEnergy, a statistical energy function derived from predicted inter-residue
error distributions. We incorporate pTMEnergy into BindEnergyCraft (BECraft), a
design pipeline that maintains the same optimization framework as BindCraft but
replaces ipTM with our energy-based objective. BECraft outperforms BindCraft,
RFDiffusion, and ESM3 across multiple challenging targets, achieving higher in
silico binder success rates while reducing structural clashes. Furthermore,
pTMEnergy establishes a new state-of-the-art in structure-based virtual
screening tasks for miniprotein and RNA aptamer binders.

Abstract: We introduce copresheaf topological neural networks (CTNNs), a powerful and
unifying framework that encapsulates a wide spectrum of deep learning
architectures, designed to operate on structured data: including images, point
clouds, graphs, meshes, and topological manifolds. While deep learning has
profoundly impacted domains ranging from digital assistants to autonomous
systems, the principled design of neural architectures tailored to specific
tasks and data types remains one of the field's most persistent open
challenges. CTNNs address this gap by grounding model design in the language of
copresheaves, a concept from algebraic topology that generalizes and subsumes
most practical deep learning models in use today. This abstract yet
constructive formulation yields a rich design space from which theoretically
sound and practically effective solutions can be derived to tackle core
challenges in representation learning: long-range dependencies, oversmoothing,
heterophily, and non-Euclidean domains. Our empirical results on structured
data benchmarks demonstrate that CTNNs consistently outperform conventional
baselines, particularly in tasks requiring hierarchical or localized
sensitivity. These results underscore CTNNs as a principled, multi-scale
foundation for the next generation of deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing
data represented in graph structures, achieving remarkable success across a
wide range of applications. However, to further improve the performance on
graph classification benchmarks, structural representation of each node that
encodes rich local topological information in the neighbourhood of nodes is an
important type of feature that is often overlooked in the modeling. The
consequence of neglecting the structural information has resulted high number
of layers to connect messages from distant nodes which by itself produces other
problems such as oversmoothing. In the present paper, we leverage these
structural information that are modeled by anonymous random walks (ARWs) and
introduce graph structure attention network (GSAT) which is a generalization of
graph attention network(GAT) to integrate the original attribute and the
structural representation to enforce the model to automatically find patterns
for attending to different edges in the node neighbourhood to enrich graph
representation. Our experiments show GSAT slightly improves SOTA on some graph
classification benchmarks.

Abstract: We consider the problem of jointly learning a one-dimensional projection and
a univariate function in high-dimensional Gaussian models. Specifically, we
study predictors of the form $f(x)=\varphi^\star(\langle w^\star, x \rangle)$,
where both the direction $w^\star \in \mathcal{S}_{d-1}$, the sphere of
$\mathbb{R}^d$, and the function $\varphi^\star: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ are
learned from Gaussian data. This setting captures a fundamental non-convex
problem at the intersection of representation learning and nonlinear
regression. We analyze the gradient flow dynamics of a natural alternating
scheme and prove convergence, with a rate controlled by the information
exponent reflecting the \textit{Gaussian regularity} of the function
$\varphi^\star$. Strikingly, our analysis shows that convergence still occurs
even when the initial direction is negatively correlated with the target. On
the practical side, we demonstrate that such joint learning can be effectively
implemented using a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) adapted to the
structure of the problem, enabling efficient and flexible estimation of the
univariate function. Our results offer both theoretical insight and practical
methodology for learning low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional
settings.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems proactively query users with relevant "key
terms" and leverage the feedback to elicit users' preferences for personalized
recommendations. Conversational contextual bandits, a prevalent approach in
this domain, aim to optimize preference learning by balancing exploitation and
exploration. However, several limitations hinder their effectiveness in
real-world scenarios. First, existing algorithms employ key term selection
strategies with insufficient exploration, often failing to thoroughly probe
users' preferences and resulting in suboptimal preference estimation. Second,
current algorithms typically rely on deterministic rules to initiate
conversations, causing unnecessary interactions when preferences are
well-understood and missed opportunities when preferences are uncertain. To
address these limitations, we propose three novel algorithms: CLiSK, CLiME, and
CLiSK-ME. CLiSK introduces smoothed key term contexts to enhance exploration in
preference learning, CLiME adaptively initiates conversations based on
preference uncertainty, and CLiSK-ME integrates both techniques. We
theoretically prove that all three algorithms achieve a tighter regret upper
bound of $O(\sqrt{dT\log{T}})$ with respect to the time horizon $T$, improving
upon existing methods. Additionally, we provide a matching lower bound
$\Omega(\sqrt{dT})$ for conversational bandits, demonstrating that our
algorithms are nearly minimax optimal. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic
and real-world datasets show that our approaches achieve at least a 14.6%
improvement in cumulative regret.

Abstract: Attribute-efficient learning of sparse halfspaces has been a fundamental
problem in machine learning theory. In recent years, machine learning
algorithms are faced with prevalent data corruptions or even adversarial
attacks. It is of central interest to design efficient algorithms that are
robust to noise corruptions. In this paper, we consider that there exists a
constant amount of malicious noise in the data and the goal is to learn an
underlying $s$-sparse halfspace $w^* \in \mathbb{R}^d$ with $\text{poly}(s,\log
d)$ samples. Specifically, we follow a recent line of works and assume that the
underlying distribution satisfies a certain concentration condition and a
margin condition at the same time. Under such conditions, we show that
attribute-efficiency can be achieved by simple variants to existing hinge loss
minimization programs. Our key contribution includes: 1) an attribute-efficient
PAC learning algorithm that works under constant malicious noise rate; 2) a new
gradient analysis that carefully handles the sparsity constraint in hinge loss
minimization.

Abstract: We study the online calibration of multi-dimensional forecasts over an
arbitrary convex set $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ relative to an
arbitrary norm $\Vert\cdot\Vert$. We connect this with the problem of external
regret minimization for online linear optimization, showing that if it is
possible to guarantee $O(\sqrt{\rho T})$ worst-case regret after $T$ rounds
when actions are drawn from $\mathcal{P}$ and losses are drawn from the dual
$\Vert \cdot \Vert_*$ unit norm ball, then it is also possible to obtain
$\epsilon$-calibrated forecasts after $T = \exp(O(\rho /\epsilon^2))$ rounds.
When $\mathcal{P}$ is the $d$-dimensional simplex and $\Vert \cdot \Vert$ is
the $\ell_1$-norm, the existence of $O(\sqrt{T\log d})$-regret algorithms for
learning with experts implies that it is possible to obtain
$\epsilon$-calibrated forecasts after $T = \exp(O(\log{d}/\epsilon^2)) =
d^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$ rounds, recovering a recent result of Peng (2025).
  Interestingly, our algorithm obtains this guarantee without requiring access
to any online linear optimization subroutine or knowledge of the optimal rate
$\rho$ -- in fact, our algorithm is identical for every setting of
$\mathcal{P}$ and $\Vert \cdot \Vert$. Instead, we show that the optimal
regularizer for the above OLO problem can be used to upper bound the above
calibration error by a swap regret, which we then minimize by running the
recent TreeSwap algorithm with Follow-The-Leader as a subroutine.
  Finally, we prove that any online calibration algorithm that guarantees
$\epsilon T$ $\ell_1$-calibration error over the $d$-dimensional simplex
requires $T \geq \exp(\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon))$ (assuming $d \geq
\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$). This strengthens the corresponding
$d^{\Omega(\log{1/\epsilon})}$ lower bound of Peng, and shows that an
exponential dependence on $1/\epsilon$ is necessary.

Abstract: We present Causal Posterior Estimation (CPE), a novel method for Bayesian
inference in simulator models, i.e., models where the evaluation of the
likelihood function is intractable or too computationally expensive, but where
one can simulate model outputs given parameter values. CPE utilizes a
normalizing flow-based (NF) approximation to the posterior distribution which
carefully incorporates the conditional dependence structure induced by the
graphical representation of the model into the neural network. Thereby it is
possible to improve the accuracy of the approximation. We introduce both
discrete and continuous NF architectures for CPE and propose a constant-time
sampling procedure for the continuous case which reduces the computational
complexity of drawing samples to O(1) as for discrete NFs. We show, through an
extensive experimental evaluation, that by incorporating the conditional
dependencies induced by the graphical model directly into the neural network,
rather than learning them from data, CPE is able to conduct highly accurate
posterior inference either outperforming or matching the state of the art in
the field.

Conclusion: 该算法为Lipschitz齐次ReLU网络提供了独立于网络规模的学习复杂性，改进了先前工作的指数依赖性。

Abstract: We study the complexity of learning real-valued Multi-Index Models (MIMs)
under the Gaussian distribution. A $K$-MIM is a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to
\mathbb{R}$ that depends only on the projection of its input onto a
$K$-dimensional subspace. We give a general algorithm for PAC learning a broad
class of MIMs with respect to the square loss, even in the presence of
adversarial label noise. Moreover, we establish a nearly matching Statistical
Query (SQ) lower bound, providing evidence that the complexity of our algorithm
is qualitatively optimal as a function of the dimension. Specifically, we
consider the class of bounded variation MIMs with the property that degree at
most $m$ distinguishing moments exist with respect to projections onto any
subspace. In the presence of adversarial label noise, the complexity of our
learning algorithm is $d^{O(m)}2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$. For the
realizable and independent noise settings, our algorithm incurs complexity
$d^{O(m)}2^{\mathrm{poly}(K)}(1/\epsilon)^{O(K)}$. To complement our upper
bound, we show that if for some subspace degree-$m$ distinguishing moments do
not exist, then any SQ learner for the corresponding class of MIMs requires
complexity $d^{\Omega(m)}$. As an application, we give the first efficient
learner for the class of positive-homogeneous $L$-Lipschitz $K$-MIMs. The
resulting algorithm has complexity $\mathrm{poly}(d)
2^{\mathrm{poly}(KL/\epsilon)}$. This gives a new PAC learning algorithm for
Lipschitz homogeneous ReLU networks with complexity independent of the network
size, removing the exponential dependence incurred in prior work.

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of fluid dynamics has advanced rapidly with neural PDE
solvers, yet a fair and strong benchmark remains fragmented due to the absence
of unified PDE datasets and standardized evaluation protocols. Although
architectural innovations are abundant, fair assessment is further impeded by
the lack of clear disentanglement between spatial, temporal and loss modules.
In this paper, we introduce FD-Bench, the first fair, modular, comprehensive
and reproducible benchmark for data-driven fluid simulation. FD-Bench
systematically evaluates 85 baseline models across 10 representative flow
scenarios under a unified experimental setup. It provides four key
contributions: (1) a modular design enabling fair comparisons across spatial,
temporal, and loss function modules; (2) the first systematic framework for
direct comparison with traditional numerical solvers; (3) fine-grained
generalization analysis across resolutions, initial conditions, and temporal
windows; and (4) a user-friendly, extensible codebase to support future
research. Through rigorous empirical studies, FD-Bench establishes the most
comprehensive leaderboard to date, resolving long-standing issues in
reproducibility and comparability, and laying a foundation for robust
evaluation of future data-driven fluid models. The code is open-sourced at

Abstract: Ratio statistics--such as relative risk and odds ratios--play a central role
in hypothesis testing, model evaluation, and decision-making across many areas
of machine learning, including causal inference and fairness analysis. However,
despite privacy concerns surrounding many datasets and despite increasing
adoption of differential privacy, differentially private ratio statistics have
largely been neglected by the literature and have only recently received an
initial treatment by Lin et al. [1]. This paper attempts to fill this lacuna,
giving results that can guide practice in evaluating ratios when the results
must be protected by differential privacy. In particular, we show that even a
simple algorithm can provide excellent properties concerning privacy, sample
accuracy, and bias, not just asymptotically but also at quite small sample
sizes. Additionally, we analyze a differentially private estimator for relative
risk, prove its consistency, and develop a method for constructing valid
confidence intervals. Our approach bridges a gap in the differential privacy
literature and provides a practical solution for ratio estimation in private
machine learning pipelines.

Conclusion: 结论是KQEs为分布表示和距离度量提供了更灵活和高效的工具，是MMD的有力补充。

Abstract: Embedding probability distributions into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHS) has enabled powerful nonparametric methods such as the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD), a statistical distance with strong theoretical and
computational properties. At its core, the MMD relies on kernel mean embeddings
to represent distributions as mean functions in RKHS. However, it remains
unclear if the mean function is the only meaningful RKHS representation.
Inspired by generalised quantiles, we introduce the notion of kernel quantile
embeddings (KQEs). We then use KQEs to construct a family of distances that:
(i) are probability metrics under weaker kernel conditions than MMD; (ii)
recover a kernelised form of the sliced Wasserstein distance; and (iii) can be
efficiently estimated with near-linear cost. Through hypothesis testing, we
show that these distances offer a competitive alternative to MMD and its fast
approximations.

Conclusion: FLDA是一种高效且鲁棒的方法，适用于资源受限的物联网网络。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces significant challenges in Internet of Things
(IoT) networks due to device limitations in energy and communication resources,
especially when considering the large size of FL models. From an energy
perspective, the challenge is aggravated if devices rely on energy harvesting
(EH), as energy availability can vary significantly over time, influencing the
average number of participating users in each iteration. Additionally, the
transmission of large model updates is more susceptible to interference from
uncorrelated background traffic in shared wireless environments. As an
alternative, federated distillation (FD) reduces communication overhead and
energy consumption by transmitting local model outputs, which are typically
much smaller than the entire model used in FL. However, this comes at the cost
of reduced model accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose FL-distillation
alternation (FLDA). In FLDA, devices alternate between FD and FL phases,
balancing model information with lower communication overhead and energy
consumption per iteration. We consider a multichannel slotted-ALOHA EH-IoT
network subject to background traffic/interference. In such a scenario, FLDA
demonstrates higher model accuracy than both FL and FD, and achieves faster
convergence than FL. Moreover, FLDA achieves target accuracies saving up to 98%
in energy consumption, while also being less sensitive to interference, both
relative to FL.

Conclusion: 预期签名及其改进估计器为时间序列和序列数据的机器学习提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: The expected signature maps a collection of data streams to a lower
dimensional representation, with a remarkable property: the resulting feature
tensor can fully characterize the data generating distribution. This
"model-free" embedding has been successfully leveraged to build multiple
domain-agnostic machine learning (ML) algorithms for time series and sequential
data. The convergence results proved in this paper bridge the gap between the
expected signature's empirical discrete-time estimator and its theoretical
continuous-time value, allowing for a more complete probabilistic
interpretation of expected signature-based ML methods. Moreover, when the data
generating process is a martingale, we suggest a simple modification of the
expected signature estimator with significantly lower mean squared error and
empirically demonstrate how it can be effectively applied to improve predictive
performance.

Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying the best arm in a multi-armed bandit
model. Despite a wealth of literature in the traditional fixed budget and fixed
confidence regimes of the best arm identification problem, it still remains a
mystery to most practitioners as to how to choose an approach and corresponding
budget or confidence parameter. We propose a new formalism to avoid this
dilemma altogether by minimizing a risk functional which explicitly balances
the performance of the recommended arm and the cost incurred by learning this
arm. In this framework, a cost is incurred for each observation during the
sampling phase, and upon recommending an arm, a performance penalty is incurred
for identifying a suboptimal arm. The learner's goal is to minimize the sum of
the penalty and cost. This new regime mirrors the priorities of many
practitioners, e.g. maximizing profit in an A/B testing framework, better than
classical fixed budget or confidence settings. We derive theoretical lower
bounds for the risk of each of two choices for the performance penalty, the
probability of misidentification and the simple regret, and propose an
algorithm called DBCARE to match these lower bounds up to polylog factors on
nearly all problem instances. We then demonstrate the performance of DBCARE on
a number of simulated models, comparing to fixed budget and confidence
algorithms to show the shortfalls of existing BAI paradigms on this problem.

Conclusion: 能量距离在分布接近时对均值差异更敏感，这一特性独立于维度，且在实际应用中具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: The energy distance is used to test distributional equality, and as a loss
function in machine learning. While $D^2(X, Y)=0$ only when $X\sim Y$, the
sensitivity to different moments is of practical importance. This work
considers $D^2(X, Y)$ in the case where the distributions are close. In this
regime, $D^2(X, Y)$ is more sensitive to differences in the means
$\bar{X}-\bar{Y}$, than differences in the covariances $\Delta$. This is due to
the structure of the energy distance and is independent of dimension. The
sensitivity to on versus off diagonal components of $\Delta$ is examined when
$X$ and $Y$ are close to isotropic. Here a dimension dependent averaging occurs
and, in many cases, off diagonal correlations contribute significantly less.
Numerical results verify these relationships hold even when distributional
assumptions are not strictly met.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) offer rich real-world data for personalized
medicine, providing insights into disease progression, treatment responses, and
patient outcomes. However, their sparsity, heterogeneity, and high
dimensionality make them difficult to model, while the lack of standardized
ground truth further complicates predictive modeling. To address these
challenges, we propose SCORE, a semi-supervised representation learning
framework that captures multi-domain disease profiles through patient
embeddings. SCORE employs a Poisson-Adapted Latent factor Mixture (PALM) Model
with pre-trained code embeddings to characterize codified features and extract
meaningful patient phenotypes and embeddings. To handle the computational
challenges of large-scale data, it introduces a hybrid Expectation-Maximization
(EM) and Gaussian Variational Approximation (GVA) algorithm, leveraging limited
labeled data to refine estimates on a vast pool of unlabeled samples. We
theoretically establish the convergence of this hybrid approach, quantify GVA
errors, and derive SCORE's error rate under diverging embedding dimensions. Our
analysis shows that incorporating unlabeled data enhances accuracy and reduces
sensitivity to label scarcity. Extensive simulations confirm SCORE's superior
finite-sample performance over existing methods. Finally, we apply SCORE to
predict disability status for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using
partially labeled EHR data, demonstrating that it produces more informative and
predictive patient embeddings for multiple MS-related conditions compared to
existing approaches.

demonstrate that, under certain conditions in the wavelet coefficients, the

energy, equivariant with respect to left and right group translations, and, as
depth increases, the scattering coefficients are less sensitive to group
translations of the signal, all desirable properties of convolutional neural
networks. Furthermore, we provide examples illustrating the application of the
scattering transform to classify data with domains involving abelian and

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables cosmological parameter estimation

machine learning for neural compression and density estimation. This requires
large training datasets which are prohibitively expensive for high-quality
simulations. We overcome this limitation with multifidelity transfer learning,
combining less expensive, lower-fidelity simulations with a limited number of
high-fidelity simulations. We demonstrate our methodology on dark matter
density maps from two separate simulation suites in the hydrodynamical CAMELS
Multifield Dataset. Pre-training on dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations
reduces the required number of high-fidelity hydrodynamical simulations by a
factor between $8$ and $15$, depending on the model complexity, posterior
dimensionality, and performance metrics used. By leveraging cheaper
simulations, our approach enables performant and accurate inference on
high-fidelity models while substantially reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become widely adopted in
gravitational wave (GW) detection pipelines due to their ability to
automatically learn hierarchical features from raw strain data. However, the
physical meaning of these learned features remains underexplored, limiting the
interpretability of such models. In this work, we propose a hybrid architecture
that combines a CNN-based feature extractor with a random forest (RF)
classifier to improve both detection performance and interpretability. Unlike
prior approaches that directly connect classifiers to CNN outputs, our method
introduces four physically interpretable metrics - variance, signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), waveform overlap, and peak amplitude - computed from the final
convolutional layer. These are jointly used with the CNN output in the RF
classifier to enable more informed decision boundaries. Tested on long-duration
strain datasets, our hybrid model outperforms a baseline CNN model, achieving a
relative improvement of 21\% in sensitivity at a fixed false alarm rate of 10
events per month. Notably, it also shows improved detection of low-SNR signals
(SNR $\le$ 10), which are especially vulnerable to misclassification in noisy
environments. Feature attribution via the RF model reveals that both
CNN-extracted and handcrafted features contribute significantly to
classification decisions, with learned variance and CNN outputs ranked among
the most informative. These findings suggest that physically motivated
post-processing of CNN feature maps can serve as a valuable tool for
interpretable and efficient GW detection, bridging the gap between deep
learning and domain knowledge.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of blast pressure fields is essential for applications in
structural safety, defense planning, and hazard mitigation. Traditional methods
such as empirical models and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations
offer limited trade offs between speed and accuracy; empirical models fail to
capture complex interactions in cluttered environments, while CFD simulations

BlastOFormer, a novel Transformer based surrogate model for full field maximum
pressure prediction from arbitrary obstacle and charge configurations.
BlastOFormer leverages a signed distance function (SDF) encoding and a grid to
grid attention based architecture inspired by OFormer and Vision Transformer
(ViT) frameworks. Trained on a dataset generated using the open source
blastFoam CFD solver, our model outperforms convolutional neural networks

Abstract: This paper investigates a general robust one-shot aggregation framework for
distributed and federated Independent Component Analysis (ICA) problem. We
propose a geometric median-based aggregation algorithm that leverages $k$-means
clustering to resolve the permutation ambiguity in local client estimations.
Our method first performs k-means to partition client-provided estimators into
clusters and then aggregates estimators within each cluster using the geometric
median. This approach provably remains effective even in highly heterogeneous
scenarios where at most half of the clients can observe only a minimal number
of samples. The key theoretical contribution lies in the combined analysis of
the geometric median's error bound-aided by sample quantiles-and the maximum
misclustering rates of the aforementioned solution of $k$-means. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is further supported by simulation
studies conducted under various heterogeneous settings.

Motivation: 现有无监督特征选择方法通常从单一视角建模，难以同时评估特征重要性和保留数据结构，限制了性能。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，BLUFS在聚类和分类任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: BLUFS通过双层框架和ℓ2,0范数约束，显著提升了无监督特征选择的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (UFS) is an important task in data
engineering. However, most UFS methods construct models from a single
perspective and often fail to simultaneously evaluate feature importance and
preserve their inherent data structure, thus limiting their performance. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel bi-level unsupervised feature
selection (BLUFS) method, including a clustering level and a feature level.
Specifically, at the clustering level, spectral clustering is used to generate
pseudo-labels for representing the data structure, while a continuous linear
regression model is developed to learn the projection matrix. At the feature
level, the $\ell_{2,0}$-norm constraint is imposed on the projection matrix for
more effectively selecting features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to combine a bi-level framework with the $\ell_{2,0}$-norm. To solve
the proposed bi-level model, we design an efficient proximal alternating
minimization (PAM) algorithm, whose subproblems either have explicit solutions
or can be computed by fast solvers. Furthermore, we establish the convergence
result and computational complexity. Finally, extensive experiments on two
synthetic datasets and eight real datasets demonstrate the superiority of BLUFS
in clustering and classification tasks.

Conclusion: 数据嵌入层在时间序列预测中并非必要，移除它们可能带来更好的结果。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in many real-world applications,
and numerous complex forecasting models have been proposed in recent years.
Despite their architectural innovations, most state-of-the-art models report
only marginal improvements -- typically just a few thousandths in standard
error metrics. These models often incorporate complex data embedding layers to
transform raw inputs into higher-dimensional representations to enhance
accuracy. But are data embedding techniques actually effective in time series
forecasting? Through extensive ablation studies across fifteen state-of-the-art
models and four benchmark datasets, we find that removing data embedding layers
from many state-of-the-art models does not degrade forecasting performance. In
many cases, it improves both accuracy and computational efficiency. The gains
from removing embedding layers often exceed the performance differences
typically reported between competing models. Code available at:

Result: 在CIFAR10和ImageNet-64×64基准测试中取得最优FID值（1.46和1.02），在文本到3D生成任务中略优于SDS和VSD。

Conclusion: Uni-Instruct为一步扩散蒸馏和知识迁移提供了理论和实证基础，具有潜在的研究价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation
approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, $f$-distill, etc, inside a
theory-driven framework which we name the \textbf{\emph{Uni-Instruct}}.
Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the
$f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the
intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an
equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models
by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification
introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that
help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also
leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the
CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet
Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional
generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the
ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA
one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step
teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35).
We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For
text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly
outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation
quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions
of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion
distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.

Conclusion: RedLamp通过多类伪异常和软标签学习，提升了时间序列异常检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection in time series has been a pivotal research
area for decades. Current mainstream approaches focus on learning normality, on
the assumption that all or most of the samples in the training set are normal.
However, anomalies in the training set (i.e., anomaly contamination) can be
misleading. Recent studies employ data augmentation to generate
pseudo-anomalies and learn the boundary separating the training samples from
the augmented samples. Although this approach mitigates anomaly contamination
if augmented samples mimic unseen real anomalies, it suffers from several
limitations. (1) Covering a wide range of time series anomalies is challenging.
(2) It disregards augmented samples that resemble normal samples (i.e., false
anomalies). (3) It places too much trust in the labels of training and
augmented samples. In response, we propose RedLamp, which employs diverse data
augmentations to generate multiclass pseudo-anomalies and learns the multiclass
boundary. Such multiclass pseudo-anomalies cover a wide variety of time series
anomalies. We conduct multiclass classification using soft labels, which
prevents the model from being overconfident and ensures its robustness against
contaminated/false anomalies. The learned latent space is inherently
explainable as it is trained to separate pseudo-anomalies into multiclasses.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RedLamp in anomaly
detection and its robustness against anomaly contamination.

Abstract: Effective and accurate diagnosis of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and
heart failure is crucial for timely medical intervention and improving patient
survival rates. Machine learning has revolutionized diagnostic methods in
recent years by developing classification models that detect diseases based on
selected features. However, these classification tasks are often highly
imbalanced, limiting the performance of classical models. Quantum models offer
a promising alternative, exploiting their ability to express complex patterns
by operating in a higher-dimensional computational space through superposition
and entanglement. These unique properties make quantum models potentially more
effective in addressing the challenges of imbalanced datasets. This work
evaluates the potential of quantum classifiers in healthcare, focusing on
Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs),
comparing them with popular classical models. The study is based on three
well-known healthcare datasets -- Prostate Cancer, Heart Failure, and Diabetes.
The results indicate that QSVMs outperform QNNs across all datasets due to
their susceptibility to overfitting. Furthermore, quantum models prove the
ability to overcome classical models in scenarios with high dataset imbalance.
Although preliminary, these findings highlight the potential of quantum models
in healthcare classification tasks and lead the way for further research in

Abstract: Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) is a flexible and effective variance reduction
technique for accelerating reliability assessments of complex power system.
Recently, data-driven surrogate models have been proposed as lower-level models
in the MLMC framework due to their high correlation and negligible execution
time once trained. However, in resource adequacy assessments, pre-labeled
datasets are typically unavailable. For large-scale systems, the efficiency
gains from surrogate models are often offset by the substantial time required
for labeling training data. Therefore, this paper introduces a speed metric
that accounts for training time in evaluating MLMC efficiency. Considering the
total time budget is limited, a vote-by-committee active learning approach is
proposed to reduce the required labeling calls. A case study demonstrates that,
within practical variance thresholds, active learning enables significantly
improved MLMC efficiency with reduced training effort, compared to regular
surrogate modelling approaches.

Result: 实验表明Schirn优于现有方法，有效解决现实PML问题。

Conclusion: Schirn通过结合稀疏性和高秩性，为PML提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: Partial Multi-Label Learning (PML) extends the multi-label learning paradigm
to scenarios where each sample is associated with a candidate label set
containing both ground-truth labels and noisy labels. Existing PML methods
commonly rely on two assumptions: sparsity of the noise label matrix and
low-rankness of the ground-truth label matrix. However, these assumptions are
inherently conflicting and impractical for real-world scenarios, where the true
label matrix is typically full-rank or close to full-rank. To address these
limitations, we demonstrate that the sparsity constraint contributes to the
high-rank property of the predicted label matrix. Based on this, we propose a
novel method Schirn, which introduces a sparsity constraint on the noise label
matrix while enforcing a high-rank property on the predicted label matrix.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Schirn compared
to state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in tackling
real-world PML challenges.

Abstract: Instrumental variables (IV) analysis is an important applied tool for areas
such as healthcare and consumer economics. For IV analysis in high-dimensional
settings, the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) using deep neural networks
offers an efficient approach. With non-i.i.d. data sourced from scattered
decentralized clients, federated learning is a popular paradigm for training
the models while promising data privacy. However, to our knowledge, no
federated algorithm for either GMM or IV analysis exists to date. In this work,
we introduce federated instrumental variables analysis (FedIV) via federated
generalized method of moments (FedGMM). We formulate FedGMM as a federated
zero-sum game defined by a federated non-convex non-concave minimax
optimization problem, which is solved using federated gradient descent ascent
(FedGDA) algorithm. One key challenge arises in theoretically characterizing
the federated local optimality. To address this, we present properties and
existence results of clients' local equilibria via FedGDA limit points.
Thereby, we show that the federated solution consistently estimates the local
moment conditions of every participating client. The proposed algorithm is
backed by extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

Abstract: Agriculture constitutes a primary source of food production, economic growth
and employment in India, but the sector is confronted with low farm
productivity and yields aggravated by increased pressure on natural resources
and adverse climate change variability. Efforts involving green revolution,
land irrigations, improved seeds and organic farming have yielded suboptimal
outcomes. The adoption of computational tools like crop recommendation systems
offers a new way to provide insights and help farmers tackle low productivity.
However, most agricultural recommendation systems in India focus narrowly on
environmental factors and regions, limiting accurate predictions of high-yield,
profitable crops. This study uses environmental and economic factors with 19
crops across 15 states to develop and evaluate Random Forest and SVM models
using 10-fold Cross Validation, Time-series Split, and Lag Variables. The
10-fold cross validation showed high accuracy (RF: 99.96%, SVM: 94.71%) but
raised overfitting concerns. Introducing temporal order, better reflecting
real-world conditions, reduced performance (RF: 78.55%, SVM: 71.18%) in the
Time-series Split.To further increase the model accuracy while maintaining the
temporal order, the Lag Variables approach was employed, which resulted in
improved performance (RF: 83.62%, SVM: 74.38%) compared to the 10-fold cross
validation approach. Overall, the models in the Time-series Split and Lag
Variable Approaches offer practical insights by handling temporal dependencies
and enhancing its adaptability to changing agricultural conditions over time.
Consequently, the study shows the Random Forest model developed based on the
Lag Variables as the most preferred algorithm for optimal crop recommendation
in the Indian context.

Abstract: In cross-silo Federated Learning (FL), client selection is critical to ensure
high model performance, yet it remains challenging due to data quality
decompensation, budget constraints, and incentive compatibility. As training
progresses, these factors exacerbate client heterogeneity and degrade global
performance. Most existing approaches treat these challenges in isolation,
making jointly optimizing multiple factors difficult. To address this, we
propose Shapley-Bid Reputation Optimized Federated Learning (SBRO-FL), a
unified framework integrating dynamic bidding, reputation modeling, and
cost-aware selection. Clients submit bids based on their perceived data
quality, and their contributions are evaluated using Shapley values to quantify
their marginal impact on the global model. A reputation system, inspired by
prospect theory, captures historical performance while penalizing
inconsistency. The client selection problem is formulated as a 0-1 integer
program that maximizes reputation-weighted utility under budget constraints.
Experiments on FashionMNIST, EMNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets show that
SBRO-FL improves accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness, even in
adversarial and low-bid interference scenarios. Our results highlight the
importance of balancing data reliability, incentive compatibility, and cost
efficiency to enable scalable and trustworthy FL deployments.

Abstract: This work proposes a framework LGKDE that learns kernel density estimation
for graphs. The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively
capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining
theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation
(KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has
unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of
kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each
graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn
the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by
maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed
perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features
and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal
density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence
guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error,
robustness, and complexity. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its
effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph
distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse

Motivation: 理解细胞对刺激的反应对生物学发现和药物开发至关重要，但弱配对数据稀缺限制了多模态学习的应用。

Result: 方法提升了转录组学的预测能力，同时保留了其可解释性。

Conclusion: 框架通过结合形态学信息丰富了基因表达表示，适用于复杂的生物学任务。

Abstract: Understanding cellular responses to stimuli is crucial for biological
discovery and drug development. Transcriptomics provides interpretable,
gene-level insights, while microscopy imaging offers rich predictive features
but is harder to interpret. Weakly paired datasets, where samples share
biological states, enable multimodal learning but are scarce, limiting their
utility for training and multimodal inference. We propose a framework to
enhance transcriptomics by distilling knowledge from microscopy images. Using
weakly paired data, our method aligns and binds modalities, enriching gene
expression representations with morphological information. To address data
scarcity, we introduce (1) Semi-Clipped, an adaptation of CLIP for cross-modal
distillation using pretrained foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art
results, and (2) PEA (Perturbation Embedding Augmentation), a novel
augmentation technique that enhances transcriptomics data while preserving
inherent biological information. These strategies improve the predictive power
and retain the interpretability of transcriptomics, enabling rich unimodal
representations for complex biological tasks.

Abstract: Suffix prediction of business processes forecasts the remaining sequence of
events until process completion. Current approaches focus on predicting a
single, most likely suffix. However, if the future course of a process is
exposed to uncertainty or has high variability, the expressiveness of a single
suffix prediction can be limited. To address this limitation, we propose
probabilistic suffix prediction, a novel approach that approximates a
probability distribution of suffixes. The proposed approach is based on an
Uncertainty-Aware Encoder-Decoder LSTM (U-ED-LSTM) and a Monte Carlo (MC)
suffix sampling algorithm. We capture epistemic uncertainties via MC dropout
and aleatoric uncertainties as learned loss attenuation. This technical report
provides a detailed evaluation of the U-ED-LSTM's predictive performance and
assesses its calibration on four real-life event logs with three different
hyperparameter settings. The results show that i) the U-ED-LSTM has reasonable
predictive performance across various datasets, ii) aggregating probabilistic
suffix predictions into mean values can outperform most likely predictions,
particularly for rare prefixes or longer suffixes, and iii) the approach
effectively captures uncertainties present in event logs.

Conclusion: D-NGD显著提升了PINN训练的效率和规模，适用于单GPU环境。

Abstract: Natural-gradient methods markedly accelerate the training of Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs), yet their Gauss--Newton update must be solved in the
parameter space, incurring a prohibitive $O(n^3)$ time complexity, where $n$ is
the number of network trainable weights. We show that exactly the same step can
instead be formulated in a generally smaller residual space of size $m =
\sum_{\gamma} N_{\gamma} d_{\gamma}$, where each residual class $\gamma$ (e.g.
PDE interior, boundary, initial data) contributes $N_{\gamma}$ collocation
points of output dimension $d_{\gamma}$.
  Building on this insight, we introduce \textit{Dual Natural Gradient Descent}
(D-NGD). D-NGD computes the Gauss--Newton step in residual space, augments it
with a geodesic-acceleration correction at negligible extra cost, and provides
both a dense direct solver for modest $m$ and a Nystrom-preconditioned
conjugate-gradient solver for larger $m$.
  Experimentally, D-NGD scales second-order PINN optimization to networks with
up to 12.8 million parameters, delivers one- to three-order-of-magnitude lower
final error $L^2$ than first-order methods (Adam, SGD) and quasi-Newton
methods, and -- crucially -- enables natural-gradient training of PINNs at this

Abstract: A pivotal area of research in antibody engineering is to find effective
modifications that enhance antibody-antigen binding affinity. Traditional
wet-lab experiments assess mutants in a costly and time-consuming manner.
Emerging deep learning solutions offer an alternative by modeling antibody
structures to predict binding affinity changes. However, they heavily depend on
high-quality complex structures, which are frequently unavailable in practice.
Therefore, we propose ProtAttBA, a deep learning model that predicts binding
affinity changes based solely on the sequence information of antibody-antigen
complexes. ProtAttBA employs a pre-training phase to learn protein sequence
patterns, following a supervised training phase using labeled antibody-antigen
complex data to train a cross-attention-based regressor for predicting binding
affinity changes. We evaluated ProtAttBA on three open benchmarks under
different conditions. Compared to both sequence- and structure-based prediction
methods, our approach achieves competitive performance, demonstrating notable
robustness, especially with uncertain complex structures. Notably, our method
possesses interpretability from the attention mechanism. We show that the
learned attention scores can identify critical residues with impacts on binding
affinity. This work introduces a rapid and cost-effective computational tool
for antibody engineering, with the potential to accelerate the development of
novel therapeutic antibodies.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning models incorporating data re-uploading circuits have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional expressivity and
trainability. However, their ability to generate accurate predictions on unseen
data, referred to as the predictive performance, remains insufficiently
investigated. This study reveals a fundamental limitation in predictive
performance when deep encoding layers are employed within the data re-uploading
model. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that when processing
high-dimensional data with limited-qubit data re-uploading models, their
predictive performance progressively degenerates to near random-guessing levels
as the number of encoding layers increases. In this context, the repeated data
uploading cannot mitigate the performance degradation. These findings are
validated through experiments on both synthetic linearly separable datasets and
real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate that when processing
high-dimensional data, the quantum data re-uploading models should be designed
with wider circuit architectures rather than deeper and narrower ones.

problem complexity and enhance solution accuracy. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to apply a PINNs-based approach to the two-dimensional
unsteady planar shock refraction problem, offering new insights into the
application of PINNs to complex shock-interface interactions. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that ST-PINNs more accurately capture sharp

Conclusion: SSL模型在AAI任务中具有一定的跨说话人一致性潜力，但仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: Acoustic-to-Articulatory Inversion (AAI) attempts to model the inverse
mapping from speech to articulation. Exact articulatory prediction from speech
alone may be impossible, as speakers can choose different forms of articulation
seemingly without reference to their vocal tract structure. However, once a
speaker has selected an articulatory form, their productions vary minimally.
Recent works in AAI have proposed adapting Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
models to single-speaker datasets, claiming that these single-speaker models
provide a universal articulatory template. In this paper, we investigate
whether SSL-adapted models trained on single and multi-speaker data produce
articulatory targets which are consistent across speaker identities for English
and Russian. We do this through the use of a novel evaluation method which
extracts articulatory targets using minimal pair sets. We also present a
training method which can improve inter-speaker consistency using only speech
data.

Abstract: This paper studies the task of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in
causal panel data models, in the presence of covariate effects. We propose a
novel Covariate-Adjusted Deep Causal Learning (CoDEAL) for panel data models,
that employs flexible model structures and powerful neural network
architectures to cohesively deal with the underlying heterogeneity and
nonlinearity of both panel units and covariate effects. The proposed CoDEAL
integrates nonlinear covariate effect components (parameterized by a
feed-forward neural network) with nonlinear factor structures (modeled by a
multi-output autoencoder) to form a heterogeneous causal panel model. The
nonlinear covariate component offers a flexible framework for capturing the
complex influences of covariates on outcomes. The nonlinear factor analysis
enables CoDEAL to effectively capture both cross-sectional and temporal
dependencies inherent in the data panel. This latent structural information is
subsequently integrated into a customized matrix completion algorithm, thereby
facilitating more accurate imputation of missing counterfactual outcomes.
Moreover, the use of a multi-output autoencoder explicitly accounts for
heterogeneity across units and enhances the model interpretability of the
latent factors. We establish theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the
estimated counterfactuals, and demonstrate the compelling performance of the
proposed method using extensive simulation studies and a real data application.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of fault prediction and delayed response
in distributed systems by proposing an intelligent prediction method based on
temporal feature learning. The method takes multi-dimensional performance
metric sequences as input. We use a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model the
evolution of system states over time. An attention mechanism is then applied to
enhance key temporal segments, improving the model's ability to identify
potential faults. On this basis, a feedforward neural network is designed to
perform the final classification, enabling early warning of system failures. To
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comparative experiments
and ablation analyses were conducted using data from a large-scale real-world
cloud system. The experimental results show that the model outperforms various
mainstream time-series models in terms of Accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC. This
demonstrates strong prediction capability and stability. Furthermore, the loss
function curve confirms the convergence and reliability of the training
process. It indicates that the proposed method effectively learns system

Abstract: Auscultation, particularly heart sound, is a non-invasive technique that
provides essential vital sign information. Recently, self-supervised acoustic
representation foundation models (FMs) have been proposed to offer insights
into acoustics-based vital signs. However, there has been little exploration of
the extent to which auscultation is encoded in these pre-trained FM
representations. In this work, using a publicly available phonocardiogram (PCG)
dataset and a heart rate (HR) estimation model, we conduct a layer-wise
investigation of six acoustic representation FMs: HuBERT, wav2vec2, wavLM,
Whisper, Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), and an in-house CLAP
model. Additionally, we implement the baseline method from Nie et al., 2024
(which relies on acoustic features) and show that overall, representation
vectors from pre-trained foundation models (FMs) offer comparable performance
to the baseline. Notably, HR estimation using the representations from the
audio encoder of the in-house CLAP model outperforms the results obtained from
the baseline, achieving a lower mean absolute error (MAE) across various
train/validation/test splits despite the domain mismatch.

Abstract: Approximation of a target probability distribution using a finite set of
points is a problem of fundamental importance, arising in cubature, data
compression, and optimisation. Several authors have proposed to select points
by minimising a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), but the non-convexity of this
objective precludes global minimisation in general. Instead, we consider
\emph{stationary} points of the MMD which, in contrast to points globally
minimising the MMD, can be accurately computed. Our main theoretical
contribution is the (perhaps surprising) result that, for integrands in the
associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the cubature error of stationary
MMD points vanishes \emph{faster} than the MMD. Motivated by this
\emph{super-convergence} property, we consider discretised gradient flows as a
practical strategy for computing stationary points of the MMD, presenting a
refined convergence analysis that establishes a novel non-asymptotic
finite-particle error bound, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Identifying super-spreaders can be framed as a subtask of the influence
maximisation problem. It seeks to pinpoint agents within a network that, if
selected as single diffusion seeds, disseminate information most effectively.
Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture
diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social),
and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in
such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a
dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to
the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to
multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the
ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies
each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the
duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and
(iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model,
TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom
aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data
and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our
model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning
methods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and
synthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves
superior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering
improved interpretability through its structured output.

Abstract: This article presents an input convex neural network architecture using
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (ICKAN). Two specific networks are presented: the
first is based on a low-order, linear-by-part, representation of functions, and
a universal approximation theorem is provided. The second is based on cubic
splines, for which only numerical results support convergence. We demonstrate
on simple tests that these networks perform competitively with classical input
convex neural networks (ICNNs). In a second part, we use the networks to solve
some optimal transport problems needing a convex approximation of functions and
demonstrate their effectiveness. Comparisons with ICNNs show that cubic ICKANs
produce results similar to those of classical ICNNs.

Motivation: 社交平台内容审核中，延迟审核的成本与内容的观看轨迹相关且未知，传统算法（如cμ规则）在此情况下表现不佳。

Method: 将每个任务视为马尔可夫滑雪租赁问题，提出OaRC算法，动态调整未来服务机会。

Result: OaRC的遗憾边界为O(L^1.5√N)，在系统规模N趋近无穷时渐近最优，且与状态空间大小无关。

Conclusion: OaRC在合成和真实数据集上均优于传统算法，适用于包含上下文信息的任务状态。

Abstract: In content moderation for social media platforms, the cost of delaying the
review of a content is proportional to its view trajectory, which fluctuates
and is apriori unknown. Motivated by such uncertain holding costs, we consider
a queueing model where job states evolve based on a Markov chain with
state-dependent instantaneous holding costs. We demonstrate that in the
presence of such uncertain holding costs, the two canonical algorithmic
principles, instantaneous-cost ($c\mu$-rule) and expected-remaining-cost
($c\mu/\theta$-rule), are suboptimal. By viewing each job as a Markovian
ski-rental problem, we develop a new index-based algorithm,
Opportunity-adjusted Remaining Cost (OaRC), that adjusts to the opportunity of
serving jobs in the future when uncertainty partly resolves. We show that the
regret of OaRC scales as $\tilde{O}(L^{1.5}\sqrt{N})$, where $L$ is the maximum
length of a job's holding cost trajectory and $N$ is the system size. This
regret bound shows that OaRC achieves asymptotic optimality when the system
size $N$ scales to infinity. Moreover, its regret is independent of the
state-space size, which is a desirable property when job states contain
contextual information. We corroborate our results with an extensive simulation
study based on two holding cost patterns (online ads and user-generated
content) that arise in content moderation for social media platforms. Our
simulations based on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that OaRC
consistently outperforms existing practice, which is based on the two canonical
algorithmic principles.

Result: VOQANet+在噪声环境下表现稳健，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合SFM和领域特征提升可解释性和鲁棒性，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Objective: Perceptual voice quality assessment plays a critical role in
diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders by providing standardized evaluation
of vocal function. Traditionally, this process relies on expert raters
utilizing standard scales, such as the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation
of Voice (CAPE-V) and Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain
(GRBAS). However, these metrics are inherently subjective and susceptible to
inter-rater variability, motivating the need for automated and objective
assessment methods. Methods: We propose Voice Quality Assessment Network
(VOQANet), a deep learning-based framework with an attention mechanism that
leverages a Speech Foundation Model (SFM) to capture high-level acoustic and
prosodic information from raw speech. To enhance robustness and
interpretability, we present VOQANet+, which integrates handcrafted acoustic
features such as jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) with SFM
embeddings. Results: Sentence-based input yields stronger performance than
vowel-based input, especially at the patient level. VOQANet consistently
outperforms baseline methods in RMSE and PCC, while VOQANet+ performs even
better and maintains robustness under noisy conditions. Conclusion: Combining
SFM embeddings with domain-informed acoustic features improves interpretability
and resilience. Significance: VOQANet+ shows strong potential for deployment in
real-world and telehealth settings, addressing the limitations of subjective
perceptual assessments with an interpretable and noise-resilient solution.

Motivation: 解决非理想活塞流反应器的设计和分析问题，通过机器学习整合物理方程，提高计算效率和准确性。

Method: FMEnets由三个互联子网络组成，支持正向预测和逆向推断，采用FME-PINNs或FME-KANs两种实现方式。

Conclusion: FMEnets为反应器设计和优化提供了高效的计算方法，并开辟了整合实验数据与物理方程的新途径。

Abstract: We propose FMEnets, a physics-informed machine learning framework for the
design and analysis of non-ideal plug flow reactors. FMEnets integrates the
fundamental governing equations (Navier-Stokes for fluid flow, material balance
for reactive species transport, and energy balance for temperature
distribution) into a unified multi-scale network model. The framework is
composed of three interconnected sub-networks with independent optimizers that
enable both forward and inverse problem-solving. In the forward mode, FMEnets
predicts velocity, pressure, species concentrations, and temperature profiles
using only inlet and outlet information. In the inverse mode, FMEnets utilizes
sparse multi-residence-time measurements to simultaneously infer unknown
kinetic parameters and states. FMEnets can be implemented either as FME-PINNs,
which employ conventional multilayer perceptrons, or as FME-KANs, based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. Comprehensive ablation studies highlight the
critical role of the FMEnets architecture in achieving accurate predictions.
Specifically, FME-KANs are more robust to noise than FME-PINNs, although both
representations are comparable in accuracy and speed in noise-free conditions.
The proposed framework is applied to three different sets of reaction scenarios
and is compared with finite element simulations. FMEnets effectively captures
the complex interactions, achieving relative errors less than 2.5% for the
unknown kinetic parameters. The new network framework not only provides a
computationally efficient alternative for reactor design and optimization, but
also opens new avenues for integrating empirical correlations, limited and
noisy experimental data, and fundamental physical equations to guide reactor
design.

Abstract: Phishing is a semantic attack which targets the user rather than the
computer. It is a new Internet crime in comparison with other forms such as
virus and hacking. Considering the damage phishing websites has caused to
various economies by collapsing organizations, stealing information and
financial diversion, various researchers have embarked on different ways of
detecting phishing websites but there has been no agreement about the best
algorithm to be used for prediction. This study is interested in integrating
the strengths of two algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multi-Class
Classification Rules based on Association Rules (MCAR) to establish a strong
and better means of predicting phishing websites. A total of 11,056 websites
were used from both PhishTank and yahoo directory to verify the effectiveness

technique; classification and prediction were done by SVM technique. The result
showed that the technique achieved 98.30% classification accuracy with a
computation time of 2205.33s with minimum error rate. It showed a total of 98%
Area under the Curve (AUC) which showed the proportion of accuracy in
classifying phishing websites. The model showed 82.84% variance in the
prediction of phishing websites based on the coefficient of determination. The
use of two techniques together in detecting phishing websites produced a more

This research work centralized on this advantage by building a hybrid of two

Abstract: Hematotoxicity, drug-induced damage to the blood-forming system, is a
frequent side effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy and poses a significant
challenge in clinical practice due to its high inter-patient variability and
limited predictability. Current mechanistic models often struggle to accurately
forecast outcomes for patients with irregular or atypical trajectories. In this
study, we develop and compare hybrid mechanistic and data-driven approaches for
individualized time series modeling of platelet counts during chemotherapy. We
consider hybrid models that combine mechanistic models with neural networks,
known as universal differential equations. As a purely data-driven alternative,
we utilize a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model using gated recurrent
units as the underlying architecture. These models are evaluated across a range
of real patient scenarios, varying in data availability and sparsity, to assess
predictive performance. Our findings demonstrate that data-driven methods, when
provided with sufficient data, significantly improve prediction accuracy,
particularly for high-risk patients with irregular platelet dynamics. This
highlights the potential of data-driven approaches in enhancing clinical
decision-making. In contrast, hybrid and mechanistic models are superior in
scenarios with limited or sparse data. The proposed modeling and comparison
framework is generalizable and could be extended to predict other
treatment-related toxicities, offering broad applicability in personalized
medicine.

Abstract: Accurate identification of breast cancer types plays a critical role in
guiding treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes. This paper presents
an artificial intelligence enabled tool designed to aid in the identification
of breast cancer types using histopathological biopsy images. Traditionally
additional tests have to be done on women who are detected with breast cancer
to find out the types of cancer it is to give the necessary cure. Those tests
are not only invasive but also delay the initiation of treatment and increase
patient burden. The proposed model utilizes a convolutional neural network
(CNN) architecture to distinguish between benign and malignant tissues as well
as accurate subclassification of breast cancer types. By preprocessing the
images to reduce noise and enhance features, the model achieves reliable levels
of classification performance. Experimental results on such datasets
demonstrate the model's effectiveness, outperforming several existing solutions
in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The study emphasizes the
potential of deep learning techniques in clinical diagnostics and offers a
promising tool to assist pathologists in breast cancer classification.

Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy leverages nuclear magnetization
to probe molecules' chemical environment, structure, and dynamics, with
applications spanning from pharmaceuticals to the petroleum industry. Despite
its utility, the high cost of NMR instrumentation, operation and the lengthy
duration of experiments necessitate the development of computational techniques
to optimize acquisition times. Non-Uniform sampling (NUS) is widely employed as
a sub-sampling method to address these challenges, but it often introduces
artifacts and degrades spectral quality, offsetting the benefits of reduced
acquisition times. In this work, we propose the use of deep learning techniques
to enhance the reconstruction quality of NUS spectra. Specifically, we explore
the application of diffusion models, a relatively untapped approach in this
domain. Our methodology involves applying diffusion models to both time-time
and time-frequency NUS data, yielding satisfactory reconstructions of
challenging spectra from the benchmark Artina dataset. This approach
demonstrates the potential of diffusion models to improve the efficiency and
accuracy of NMR spectroscopy as well as the superiority of using a
time-frequency domain data over the time-time one, opening new landscapes for
future studies.

Abstract: We introduce a data-driven method for learning the equations of motion of
mechanical systems directly from position measurements, without requiring
access to velocity data. This is particularly relevant in system identification
tasks where only positional information is available, such as motion capture,
pixel data or low-resolution tracking. Our approach takes advantage of the
discrete Lagrange-d'Alembert principle and the forced discrete Euler-Lagrange
equations to construct a physically grounded model of the system's dynamics. We
decompose the dynamics into conservative and non-conservative components, which
are learned separately using feed-forward neural networks. In the absence of
external forces, our method reduces to a variational discretization of the
action principle naturally preserving the symplectic structure of the
underlying Hamiltonian system. We validate our approach on a variety of
synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to
baseline methods. In particular, we apply our model to (1) measured human
motion data and (2) latent embeddings obtained via an autoencoder trained on
image sequences. We demonstrate that we can faithfully reconstruct and separate
both the conservative and forced dynamics, yielding interpretable and
physically consistent predictions.

Abstract: Wearable human activity recognition has been shown to benefit from the
inclusion of acoustic data, as the sounds around a person often contain
valuable context. However, due to privacy concerns, it is usually not ethically
feasible to record and save microphone data from the device, since the audio
could, for instance, also contain private conversations. Rather, the data
should be processed locally, which in turn requires processing power and
consumes energy on the wearable device. One special use case of contextual
information that can be utilized to augment special tasks in human activity
recognition is water flow detection, which can, e.g., be used to aid wearable
hand washing detection. We created a new label called tap water for the
recently released HD-Epic data set, creating 717 hand-labeled annotations of
tap water flow, based on existing annotations of the water class. We analyzed
the relation of tap water and water in the dataset and additionally trained and
evaluated two lightweight classifiers to evaluate the newly added label class,
showing that the new class can be learned more easily.

Abstract: Extragalactic foregrounds in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations
are both a source of cosmological and astrophysical information and a nuisance
to the CMB. Effective field-level modeling that captures their non-Gaussian
statistical distributions is increasingly important for optimal information
extraction, particularly given the precise and low-noise observations from
current and upcoming experiments. We explore the use of Wavelet Flow (WF)
models to tackle the novel task of modeling the field-level probability
distributions of multi-component CMB secondaries. Specifically, we jointly
train correlated CMB lensing convergence ($\kappa$) and cosmic infrared
background (CIB) maps with a WF model and obtain a network that statistically
recovers the input to high accuracy -- the trained network generates samples of
$\kappa$ and CIB fields whose average power spectra are within a few percent of
the inputs across all scales, and whose Minkowski functionals are similarly
accurate compared to the inputs. Leveraging the multiscale architecture of
these models, we fine-tune both the model parameters and the priors at each
scale independently, optimizing performance across different resolutions. These
results demonstrate that WF models can accurately simulate correlated
components of CMB secondaries, supporting improved analysis of cosmological
data. Our code and trained models can be found here

Abstract: In compressible fluid flow, reconstructing shocks, discontinuities,
rarefactions, and their interactions from sparse measurements is an important
inverse problem with practical applications. Moreover, physics-informed machine
learning has recently become an increasingly popular approach for performing
reconstructions tasks. In this work we explore a machine learning recipe, known
as GraphGPS, for reconstructing canonical compressible flows known as 3D
Riemann problems from sparse observations, in a physics-informed manner. The
GraphGPS framework combines the benefits of positional encodings, local
message-passing of graphs, and global contextual awareness, and we explore the
latter two components through an ablation study. Furthermore, we modify the
aggregation step of message-passing such that it is aware of shocks and
discontinuities, resulting in sharper reconstructions of these features.
Additionally, we modify message-passing such that information flows strictly
from known nodes only, which results in computational savings, better training
convergence, and no degradation of reconstruction accuracy. We also show that
the GraphGPS framework outperforms numerous machine learning benchmarks.

Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) are an
important resource for the identification of new therapeutic targets and
cardioprotective drugs. After differentiation iPSC-CMs show an immature,
fetal-like phenotype. Cultivation of iPSC-CMs in lipid-supplemented maturation
medium (MM) strongly enhances their structural, metabolic and functional
phenotype. Nevertheless, assessing iPSC-CM maturation state remains challenging
as most methods are time consuming and go in line with cell damage or loss of
the sample. To address this issue, we developed a non-invasive approach for
automated classification of iPSC-CM maturity through interpretable artificial
intelligence (AI)-based analysis of beat characteristics derived from
video-based motion analysis. In a prospective study, we evaluated 230 video
recordings of early-state, immature iPSC-CMs on day 21 after differentiation
(d21) and more mature iPSC-CMs cultured in MM (d42, MM). For each recording, 10
features were extracted using Maia motion analysis software and entered into a
support vector machine (SVM). The hyperparameters of the SVM were optimized in
a grid search on 80 % of the data using 5-fold cross-validation. The optimized
model achieved an accuracy of 99.5 $\pm$ 1.1 % on a hold-out test set. Shapley
Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified displacement, relaxation-rise time and
beating duration as the most relevant features for assessing maturity level.
Our results suggest the use of non-invasive, optical motion analysis combined
with AI-based methods as a tool to assess iPSC-CMs maturity and could be
applied before performing functional readouts or drug testing. This may
potentially reduce the variability and improve the reproducibility of
experimental studies.

Abstract: Cyclic peptides offer inherent advantages in pharmaceuticals. For example,
cyclic peptides are more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis compared to linear
peptides and usually exhibit excellent stability and affinity. Although deep
generative models have achieved great success in linear peptide design, several
challenges prevent the development of computational methods for designing
diverse types of cyclic peptides. These challenges include the scarcity of 3D
structural data on target proteins and associated cyclic peptide ligands, the
geometric constraints that cyclization imposes, and the involvement of
non-canonical amino acids in cyclization. To address the above challenges, we
introduce CpSDE, which consists of two key components: AtomSDE, a generative
structure prediction model based on harmonic SDE, and ResRouter, a residue type
predictor. Utilizing a routed sampling algorithm that alternates between these
two models to iteratively update sequences and structures, CpSDE facilitates
the generation of cyclic peptides. By employing explicit all-atom and bond
modeling, CpSDE overcomes existing data limitations and is proficient in
designing a wide variety of cyclic peptides. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the cyclic peptides designed by our method exhibit reliable
stability and affinity.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the incidence of
post-infection cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction, in
individuals over 40. While the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, this study
employs a hybrid machine learning approach to analyze epidemiological data in
assessing 13 key heart attack risk factors and their susceptibility. Based on a
unique dataset that combines demographic, biochemical, ECG, and thallium
stress-tests, this study categorizes distinct subpopulations against varying
risk profiles and then divides the population into 'at-risk' (AR) and
'not-at-risk' (NAR) groups using clustering algorithms. The study reveals
strong association between the likelihood of experiencing a heart attack on the
13 risk factors studied. The aggravated risk for postmenopausal patients
indicates compromised individual risk factors due to estrogen depletion that
may be, further compromised by extraneous stress impacts, like anxiety and
fear, aspects that have traditionally eluded data modeling predictions.
