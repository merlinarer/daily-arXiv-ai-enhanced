To enable systematic and fine-grained evaluation, we developed RxBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers common prescription review categories and consolidates 14 frequent types of prescription errors drawn from authoritative pharmacy references. RxBench consists of 1,150 single-choice, 230 multiple-choice, and 879 short-answer items, all reviewed by experienced clinical pharmacists. We benchmarked 18 state-of-the-art LLMs and identified clear stratification of performance across tasks. Notably, Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 consistently formed the first tier, outperforming other models in both accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with licensed pharmacists indicated that leading LLMs can match or exceed human performance in certain tasks. Furthermore, building on insights from our benchmark evaluation, we performed targeted fine-tuning on a mid-tier model, resulting in a specialized model that rivals leading general-purpose LLMs in performance on short-answer question tasks. The main contribution of RxBench lies in establishing a standardized, error-type-oriented framework that not only reveals the capabilities and limitations of frontier LLMs in prescription review but also provides a foundational resource for building more reliable and specialized clinical tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "RxBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027LLM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5355/\u591a\u9009\u548c\u7b80\u7b54\u9898\uff0c\u6db5\u76d614\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u5904\u65b9\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8618\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53ef\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6267\u4e1a\u836f\u5e08\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u6838\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u5177\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86RxBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b1,150\u4e2a\u5355\u9009\u9898\u3001230\u4e2a\u591a\u9009\u9898\u548c879\u4e2a\u7b80\u7b54\u9898\uff0c\u6db5\u76d614\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u5904\u65b9\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u9898\u76ee\u5747\u7531\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u836f\u5e08\u5ba1\u6838\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8618\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfLLM\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6267\u4e1a\u836f\u5e08\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8fd8\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e2d\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u6027\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5206\u5c42\uff1aGemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06\u3001Grok-4-0709\u548cDeepSeek-R1-0528\u7ec4\u6210\u7b2c\u4e00\u68af\u961f\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u9886\u5148LLM\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53ef\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u836f\u5e08\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u7b80\u7b54\u9898\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u9886\u5148\u901a\u7528LLM\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RxBench\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u3001\u4ee5\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u5728\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u6838\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Typically, state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models are developed by large corporations based on large data collections and substantial computational and financial resources required to pretrain such models from scratch. These foundation models then serve as the basis for further development and domain adaptation for specific use cases or tasks. However, given the dynamic and fast-paced nature of launching new foundation models, the process of selecting the most suitable model for a particular use case, application, or domain becomes increasingly complex. We argue that there are two main dimensions that need to be taken into consideration when selecting a model for further training: a qualitative dimension (which model is best suited for a task based on information, for instance, taken from model cards) and a quantitative dimension (which is the best performing model). The quantitative performance of models is assessed through leaderboards, which rank models based on standardized benchmarks and provide a consistent framework for comparing different LLMs. In this work, we address the analysis of the quantitative dimension by exploring the current leaderboards and benchmarks. To illustrate this analysis, we focus on the medical domain as a case study, demonstrating the evolution, current landscape, and practical significance of this quantitative evaluation dimension. Finally, we propose a Model Selection Methodology (MSM), a systematic approach designed to guide the navigation, prioritization, and selection of the model that best aligns with a given use case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524dLLM\u6392\u884c\u699c\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u7528\u4f8b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u590d\u6742\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u578b\u5361\u7247\uff09\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u6392\u884c\u699c\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5e03\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524dLLM\u6392\u884c\u699c\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3001\u73b0\u72b6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff08MSM\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u7528\u4f8b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLM\u6392\u884c\u699c\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MSM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4f17\u591a\u53ef\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u6700\u9002\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u8fc7\u6392\u884c\u699c\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MSM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5e03\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCCD\uff08\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u7801\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u5373\u65f6\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6216\u71b5\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u6b20\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCCD\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u5e8f\u5217\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u62d2\u7edd\u6b21\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728Dream\u548cLLaDA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe3.48\u500d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53473.91%\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "CCD\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.\n  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.\n  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping.

However, overlapping risk factors and data asymmetry make prediction difficult. To use extensive health survey data to create a machine learning framework for diabetes classification that is both accurate and comprehensible, to produce results that will aid in clinical decision-making. Using the BRFSS dataset, we assessed a number of supervised learning techniques. SMOTE and Tomek Links were used to correct class imbalance. To improve prediction performance, both individual models and ensemble techniques such as stacking were investigated. The 2015 BRFSS dataset, which includes roughly 253,680 records with 22 numerical features, is used in this study. Strong ROC-AUC performance of approximately 0.96 was attained by the individual models Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.The stacking ensemble with XGBoost and KNN yielded the best overall results with 94.82\\% accuracy, ROC-AUC of 0.989, and PR-AUC of 0.991, indicating a favourable balance between recall and precision.

However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($\u03b4$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $\u03b4> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\\mathbb{E}[n] \\leq 4/\u03b4$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification.

Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput.

Code available at: https://github.com/hdeng26/Contex", "summary": "Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6536\u655b\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57288\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e16\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4f17\u591a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u65cb\u8f6c\u6216\u88c1\u526a\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u8fa8\u522b\u6837\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u771f\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f8\u540c\u6807\u7b7e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6536\u655b\u76ee\u6807\uff1a1\uff09\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u540c\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff1b2\uff09\u62c9\u8fd1\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fdc\u79bb\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR10\u3001CIFAR100\u3001Caltech-101\u3001Caltech-256\u3001ImageNet\u3001BiasedMNIST\u3001UTKFace\u548cCelebA\u7b498\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e16\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728BiasedMNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u670922.9%\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce \\emph{VoxCap}, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: \\emph{de-novo} design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse \\textit{de-novo} hits. When combined with our fast search workflow, VoxCap reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling the search of large libraries that are intractable to search by brute force.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVoxCap\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f53\u7d20\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u836f\u6548\u56e2\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6027\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u836f\u6548\u56e2\u7684\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u968f\u7740\u5206\u5b50\u5e93\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6025\u5267\u589e\u52a0\uff1b2) \u53ea\u80fd\u4ece\u73b0\u6709\u5316\u5408\u7269\u5e93\u4e2d\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u5206\u5b50\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u53c8\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVoxCap\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4f53\u7d20\u5316\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4f53\u7d20\u6807\u6ce8\u751f\u6210SMILES\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u79cd\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1) \u4ece\u5934\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5b50\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u836f\u6548\u56e2-\u5f62\u72b6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u5206\u5b50\uff1b2) \u5feb\u901f\u641c\u7d22\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5ec9\u4ef7\u76842D\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22", "result": "VoxCap\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4ece\u5934\u547d\u4e2d\u5206\u5b50\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u641c\u7d22\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5b50\u8fd4\u56de\u547d\u4e2d\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u641c\u7d22\u4f20\u7edf\u66b4\u529b\u641c\u7d22\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5927\u578b\u5206\u5b50\u5e93", "conclusion": "VoxCap\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u836f\u6548\u56e2\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "relevance": 35.0}}

DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540cMEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u4ee5Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5728KeSpeech\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc6\u522b\u516d\u79cd\u666e\u901a\u8bdd\u5b50\u65b9\u8a00\u3002", "result": "GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe73.25%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u901f2.1\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u548cPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9VLMs\u8bc6\u522bT2I\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u768427\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u5305\u542b5\u4e2aT2I\u6a21\u578b\u548c3\u4e2aVLM\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dT2I\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u6b63\u786e\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u6307\u5b9a\u989c\u8272\uff09\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0cVLM\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u672a\u80fd\u8ddf\u4e0aVLM\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30T2I\u6a21\u578b\u548cVLMs\uff1a1) \u6d4b\u8bd5VLMs\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8bc6\u522bT2I\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u768427\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2) \u521b\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b5\u4e2aT2I\u6a21\u578b\uff08Flux, SD3\u7cfb\u5217\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u548c3\u4e2aVLM\uff08Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral\uff09\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u7531LLM\uff08Llama3\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1VLM\u662f\u5426\u6b63\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec6\u5fae\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u63a8\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aT2I\u6a21\u578b\u548cVLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

The procedure first consists in determining the solution trace on the boundaries of the domain by solving a boundary integral equation, after which the volumetric solution can be recovered at low computational cost with a boundary integral representation. As the first step of the BEM represents the main computational bottleneck, we introduce PIBNet, a learning-based approach designed to approximate the solution trace. The method leverages a physics-inspired graph-based strategy to model obstacles and their long-range interactions efficiently. Then, we introduce a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture for simulating the multiple scattering. To train and evaluate our network, we present a benchmark consisting of several datasets of different types of multiple scattering problems.

Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference.

In this work, we present a data efficient strategy for fine tuning BERT on hate speech classification by significantly reducing training set size without compromising performance. Our approach employs a TF IDF-based sample selection mechanism to retain only the most informative 75 percent of examples, thereby minimizing training overhead. To address the limitations of BERT's native vocabulary in capturing evolving hate speech terminology, we augment the tokenizer with domain-specific slang and lexical variants commonly found in abusive contexts. Experimental results on a widely used hate speech dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while improving computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for scalable and adaptive abusive content moderation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684BERT\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7TF-IDF\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u51cf\u5c1175%\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u672f\u8bed\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u8fb1\u9a82\u6027\u8a00\u8bba\u6301\u7eed\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u65b0\u4fda\u8bed\u548c\u4f2a\u88c5\u672f\u8bed\u4e0d\u65ad\u51fa\u73b0\u4ee5\u89c4\u907f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14BERT\u539f\u751f\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u672f\u8bed\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528TF-IDF\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u768475%\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff1b2) \u589e\u5f3aBERT\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4fda\u8bed\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u53d8\u4f53\uff1b3) \u5728\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03BERT\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8fb1\u9a82\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type.

I propose the SFL Transformer, a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Contextual Gating mechanism (an Intermediate SFL) to modulate the sequence of hidden states within the BERT encoder stack, rather than fusing features at the final output layer. This approach modulates the deep, contextualized semantic features (Hseq) using low-dimensional structural cues (Fstruct). The model is applied to a challenging binary classification task derived from UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings. The SFL Transformer achieved an Accuracy of 0.9910 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9910, significantly improving the state-of-the-art established by the previously published SFL model (Accuracy 0.9894). Crucially, this Contextual Gating strategy maintained exceptional reliability, with a low Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489).

While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.\n  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.\n  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "STRIDE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e09\u79cd\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u5f15\u5bfc\u52a9\u624b\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u4ece\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u90e8\u7f72\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u672c\u3001\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u771f\u6b63\u9700\u8981\u4ee3\u7406AI\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7b80\u5355LLM\u8c03\u7528\u6216\u5f15\u5bfc\u52a9\u624b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTRIDE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u9700\u6c42\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u7406\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u8350\u4e09\u79cd\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u76f4\u63a5LLM\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u5f15\u5bfcAI\u52a9\u624b\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406AI\u3002", "result": "\u572830\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\uff08SRE\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cSTRIDE\u8fbe\u523092%\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1145%\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e37%\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u30026\u4e2a\u6708\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u786e\u8ba4\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4ee3\u7406\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u4ec5\u5728\u6536\u76ca\u8bc1\u660e\u6210\u672c\u5408\u7406\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4e3aLLM\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

To reduce computing and memory cost, pruning offers a promising solution by removing unimportant parameters. However, despite their success on standard LLMs, existing pruning methods severely damage RLMs, as even moderate sparsity (e.g., 20%) can collapse accuracy and completely disrupt the model's reasoning coherence. We begin by analyzing why existing pruning pipelines fail on reasoning LLMs and find that their brittleness largely stems from a mismatch between the calibration data, the pruning objective, and the model's decode-time reasoning behavior. Our study further shows that the most reliable calibration signal comes not from human-written labels but from the model's own self-generated reasoning traces, which more accurately reflect its inference distribution. Guided by these insights, we introduce RESP, a self-reflective structured pruning framework that aligns pruning decisions with the model's reasoning dynamics through self-generated calibration, decode-only gradient-based importance estimation, and progressive regeneration that maintains calibration fidelity as sparsity increases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate that RESP markedly outperforms existing structured pruning methods on both GSM8K and MathQA, preserving near-dense accuracy at 20-30% sparsity and substantially mitigating performance collapse at higher sparsity levels. At 40% sparsity, RESP attains 81.3% accuracy on GSM8K and 59.6% on MathQA, surpassing the strongest baselines by 66.87% and 47%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRESP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u68af\u5ea6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u518d\u751f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982OpenAI o1\u3001DeepSeek-R1\u3001Qwen3\uff09\u867d\u7136\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u51c6LLMs\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406LLMs\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u4e2d\u7b49\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\uff08\u598220%\uff09\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u5e76\u5b8c\u5168\u7834\u574f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "method": "RESP\uff08\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff1b2\uff09\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u68af\u5ea6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3\uff09\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u518d\u751f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u4fdd\u6301\u6821\u51c6\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen3-8B\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRESP\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u572820-30%\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u7f13\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u572840%\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0cGSM8K\u8fbe\u523081.3%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cMathQA\u8fbe\u523059.6%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534766.87%\u548c47%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406LLMs\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u3001\u526a\u679d\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002RESP\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u68af\u5ea6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u518d\u751f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406LLMs\u7684\u6709\u6548\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u90e8\u7f72\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results.

We present an explainable, few-shot AI4E framework that is systematically informed by physics and expert knowledge throughout its architecture. Starting from only 32 experimental samples in an aerial K439B superalloy castings repair welding case, we first augment physically plausible synthetic data through a three-stage protocol: differentiated noise injection calibrated to process variabilities, enforcement of hard physical constraints, and preservation of inter-parameter relationships. We then employ a nested optimization strategy for constitutive model discovery, where symbolic regression explores equation structures while differential evolution optimizes parameters, followed by intensive parameter refinement using hybrid global-local optimization. The resulting interpretable constitutive equation achieves 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency. This equation not only provides quantitative predictions but also delivers explicit physical insight, revealing how thermal, geometric, and metallurgical mechanisms couple to drive cracking-thereby advancing engineers' cognitive understanding of the process. Furthermore, the constitutive equation serves as a multi-functional tool for process optimization and high-fidelity virtual data generation, enabling accuracy improvements in other data-driven models. Our approach provides a general blueprint for developing trustworthy AI systems that embed engineering domain knowledge directly into their architecture, enabling reliable adoption in high-stakes industrial applications where data is limited but physical understanding is available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672cAI\u5de5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4ece\u4ec532\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u672c\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u70ed\u88c2\u7eb9\u503e\u5411\u8fbe\u523088%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1aAI\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u5c24\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5d4c\u5165\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u8bae\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5d4c\u5957\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u672c\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5dee\u5206\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff1b3\uff09\u6df7\u5408\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u7cbe\u70bc\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u4ec532\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u672c\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4bK439B\u9ad8\u6e29\u5408\u91d1\u94f8\u9020\u4fee\u590d\u710a\u63a5\u7684\u70ed\u88c2\u7eb9\u503e\u5411\u8fbe\u523088%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u4f46\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u91c7\u7528\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.", "AI": {"tldr": "MODOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u4eba\u4e0e\u513f\u7ae5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u80fd\u591f\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u8868\u793a\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u4e60\u5f97\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6210\u4eba\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u513f\u7ae5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5f62\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u513f\u7ae5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u4eba\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u4e60\u5f97\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u6027\u8bed\u6cd5\u8303\u7574\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "MODOMA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u65b9\u9762\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u4e60\u5f97\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u8303\u7574\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRobustSurg\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u683c-\u5185\u5bb9\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5272\u7684\u8de8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u5176\u4ed6\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u3002\u81ea\u7136\u573a\u666f\u7684\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u573a\u666f\u6781\u5176\u591a\u6837\u3002", "method": "1. \u5229\u7528\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u606f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6620\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u83b7\u5f97\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u5728ResNet\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u79fb\u9664\u4e0e\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u5bf9\u8c61\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u663e\u8457\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff1b3. \u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u89e3\u51b3\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684HeiCholSeg\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfDeepLabv3+\u63d0\u5347\u8fd123%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534710-32%\uff08\u5e73\u5747IoU\uff09\uff1b\u5728EndoUDA\u606f\u8089\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u8fd122%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u8fd1\u671fSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8fd111%\u3002", "conclusion": "RobustSurg\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u683c-\u5185\u5bb9\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5272\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

However, the dominant frequencies in time series may shift with the evolving spectral distribution of the data. Traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which employ a fixed number of experts, struggle to adapt to these changes, resulting in frequency coverage imbalance issue. Specifically, too few experts can lead to the overlooking of critical information, while too many can introduce noise. To this end, we propose Ada-MoGE, an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model. Ada-MoGE integrates spectral intensity and frequency response to adaptively determine the number of experts, ensuring alignment with the input data's frequency distribution. This approach prevents both information loss due to an insufficient number of experts and noise contamination from an excess of experts. Additionally, to prevent noise introduction from direct band truncation, we employ Gaussian band-pass filtering to smoothly decompose the frequency domain features, further optimizing the feature representation. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on six public benchmarks with only 0.2 million parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAda-MoGE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u56fa\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57286\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u5e03\u4f1a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9891\u7387\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u7684MoE\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u9891\u7387\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e13\u5bb6\u592a\u5c11\u4f1a\u5ffd\u7565\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u592a\u591a\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAda-MoGE\uff08\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5149\u8c31\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u5e26\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u89e3\u9891\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76f4\u63a5\u9891\u5e26\u622a\u65ad\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u57286\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4ec520\u4e07\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "Ada-MoGE\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfMoE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 40.0}}

However, their reliability and robustness under adversarial or faulty conditions remain largely unexamined, despite operating in high-risk, irreversible financial environments. We propose TradeTrap, a unified evaluation framework for systematically stress-testing both adaptive and procedural autonomous trading agents. TradeTrap targets four core components of autonomous trading agents: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio and ledger handling, and trade execution, and evaluates their robustness under controlled system-level perturbations. All evaluations are conducted in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions, enabling fair and reproducible comparisons across agents and attacks. Extensive experiments show that small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level.

Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.\n  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).\n  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers.

While Transformer-based models effectively capture long-range dependencies, they often suffer from quadratic complexity and overfitting due to data sparsity. Conversely, efficient linear models struggle to depict complex non-linear local dynamics. Furthermore, existing multi-scale frameworks typically rely on average pooling, which acts as a non-ideal low-pass filter, leading to spectral aliasing and the irreversible loss of high-frequency transients. In response, this paper proposes DPWMixer, a computationally efficient Dual-Path architecture. The framework is built upon a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid that replaces traditional pooling, utilizing orthogonal decomposition to explicitly disentangle trends and local fluctuations without information loss. To process these components, we design a Dual-Path Trend Mixer that integrates a global linear mapping for macro-trend anchoring and a flexible patch-based MLP-Mixer for micro-dynamic evolution. Finally, An adaptive multi-scale fusion module then integrates predictions from diverse scales, weighted by channel stationarity to optimize synthesis. Extensive experiments on eight public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fundamentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e03\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684AI\uff08\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1AI\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u8c03\u8282\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u8d85\u8d8a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u751f\u7269\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u6574\u5408AI\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e03\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u610f\u8bc6\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8868\u5f81\u7ef4\u62a4\u3001\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5185\u5728\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dAI\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u7ec8\u8eab\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5355\u7eaf\u6269\u5c55\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684AI\uff08\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u5bfc\u5411\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u6709\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u914d\u5907\u6539\u9769\u6027\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6cbb\u7406\u6027\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

A model's ability to generate such traces can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve their utility in predicting an answer. This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%.

These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic\" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats.

However, existing GCL approaches with structural augmentations often struggle to identify task-relevant topological structures, let alone adapt to the varying coarse-to-fine topological granularities required across different downstream tasks. To remedy this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL), a novel framework that leverages transformations of the same graph to generate multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes, embodying the concept of topological granularity, thereby generating diverse topological views. Recognizing that a certain granularity may contain misleading semantics, we propose a multi-granularity decoupled contrast and apply a granularity-specific weighting mechanism based on uncertainty estimation. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HTG-GCL, highlighting its superior performance in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information.", "AI": {"tldr": "HTG-GCL\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u62d3\u6251\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u73af\u72b6\u7ec6\u80de\u590d\u5f62\u6765\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u5bf9\u6bd4\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5b9a\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4ece\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7c92\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1) \u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u4e00\u56fe\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u73af\u72b6\u7ec6\u80de\u590d\u5f62\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u62d3\u6251\u7c92\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5b9a\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5404\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eHTG-GCL\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u6355\u6349\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "HTG-GCL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7c92\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u62d3\u6251\u8868\u793a\u548c\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u5bf9\u6bd4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

We present DialogGuard, a multi-agent framework for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses along five high-severity dimensions: privacy violations, discriminatory behaviour, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behaviour. DialogGuard can be applied to diverse generative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases. We release Dialog-Guard as open-source software with a web interface that provides per-dimension risk scores and explainable natural-language rationales.

Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception.

To address three core challenges in real-world scenarios: limited and non-IID data, effective extraction and fusion of multi-modal information, and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting in model learning, a task-driven supervised multi-modal federated feature extraction method is proposed. The method integrates multi-modal information extraction and contrastive learning mechanisms, and can adapt to different neural network structures as the latent mapping functions for data of each modality. It supports each client to independently learn low-dimensional representations of multi-modal data, and can flexibly control the degree of retention of effective information about the response variable in the predictive variables within the low-dimensional features through parameter tuning. The multi-constraint learning framework constructed by the method guarantees regression accuracy using Mean Squared Error loss. Through the synergistic effect of mutual information preservation constraint, symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint, and inter-model contrastive constraint, it achieves the retention of task-related information, the extraction, fusion, and alignment of multi-modal features, and the mitigation of representation drift and catastrophic forgetting in non-IID scenarios, respectively. This ensures that the feature extraction process always centers on improving the performance of downstream regression tasks. Experimental results from simulations and real-world data analysis demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more significant performance improvement on downstream regression tasks compared with classical feature extraction techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u90a6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff1a1) \u6709\u9650\u4e14\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff1b2) \u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\uff1b3) \u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6620\u5c04\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u4fdd\u8bc1\u56de\u5f52\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u5bf9\u79f0KL\u6563\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u878d\u5408\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f13\u89e3\u975eIID\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0b\u6e38\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5728\u975eIID\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "relevance": 40.0}}

They are practised in agriculture to sustain food production. These strategies can be found in unstructured data (for example, scientific literature from the Elsevier website) or structured (heterogeneous climate data via government APIs). We present Climate Adaptation question-answering with Improved Readability and Noted Sources (CAIRNS), a framework that enables experts -- farmer advisors -- to obtain credible preliminary answers from complex evidence sources from the web. It enhances readability and citation reliability through a structured ScholarGuide prompt and achieves robust evaluation via a consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator that leverages inter-model agreement with experts. Together, these components enable readable, verifiable, and domain-grounded question-answering without fine-tuning or reinforcement learning.

To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\\% of their energy consumption.

We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images).

Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios.

This paper offers a thorough analysis of four pricing algorithms -- Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG -- across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes. By utilizing profit- and price-based collusion indices, we investigate how the interactions among algorithms, market structure, and stochastic demand collaboratively influence competitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that reinforcement-learning algorithms often sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand, with DDPG demonstrating the most pronounced collusive tendencies. Demand shocks produce notably varied effects: Logit markets suffer significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets experience shock-induced profit inflation. Despite marked changes in absolute performance, the relative rankings of the algorithms are consistent across different environments.

Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniGuard\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u62a4\u680f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08OLLMs\uff09\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u62a4\u680f\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOmniGuard\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u62a4\u680f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc721\u4e07\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5927\u578b\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6837\u672c\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u90fd\u6807\u6ce8\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u84b8\u998f\u4ece\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u53d6\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u572815\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOmniGuard\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniGuard\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability.

In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence.

Single-lead ECG recording is integrated into both clinical-grade and consumer wearables. While self-supervised pretraining of foundation models on unlabeled ECGs improves diagnostic performance, existing approaches do not incorporate domain knowledge from clinical metadata. We introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that utilizes an established clinical risk score to adaptively weight negative pairs: clinically-guided contrastive learning. It aligns the similarities of ECG embeddings with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with an explicit mechanism to handle missing metadata. On 12-lead ECGs from 161K patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset, we pretrain single-lead ECG foundation models at three scales, collectively called CLEF, using only routinely collected metadata without requiring per-sample ECG annotations. We evaluate CLEF on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across 7 held-out datasets, and benchmark against 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms. When pretrained on 12-lead ECG data and tested on lead-I data, CLEF outperforms self-supervised foundation model baselines: the medium-sized CLEF achieves average AUROC improvements of at least 2.6% in classification and average reductions in MAEs of at least 3.2% in regression. Comparing with existing self-supervised learning algorithms, CLEF improves the average AUROC by at least 1.8%. Moreover, when pretrained only on lead-I data for classification tasks, CLEF performs comparably to the state-of-the-art ECGFounder, which was trained in a supervised manner. Overall, CLEF enables more accurate and scalable single-lead ECG analysis, advancing remote health monitoring.

However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases.

We introduce Ordered Sparse Autoencoders (OSAE), which extend Matryoshka SAEs by (1) establishing a strict ordering of latent features and (2) deterministically using every feature dimension, avoiding the sampling-based approximations of prior nested SAE methods. Theoretically, we show that OSAEs resolve permutation non-identifiability in settings of sparse dictionary learning where solutions are unique (up to natural symmetries). Empirically on Gemma2-2B and Pythia-70M, we show that OSAEs can help improve consistency compared to Matryoshka baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "OSAE\uff08\u6709\u5e8f\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8de8\u79cd\u5b50\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e2d\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86SAEs\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "method": "OSAE\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Matryoshka SAEs\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a(1) \u5efa\u7acb\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c(2) \u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5148\u524d\u5d4c\u5957SAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660eOSAE\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6392\u5217\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728Gemma2-2B\u548cPythia-70M\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOSAE\u76f8\u6bd4Matryoshka\u57fa\u7ebf\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfSAEs\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "OSAE\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53MMO\u6a21\u62df\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u6570\u503c\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SFT\u548cRL\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMMO\u6e38\u620f\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6216\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u53c2\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u957f\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u5e72\u6270\u73a9\u5bb6\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u4eff\u771f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u73a9\u5bb6\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5bf9\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5bf9LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RL)\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u9002\u5e94\u5230\u6e38\u620f\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6e38\u620f\u65e5\u5fd7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u6e38\u620f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b3) \u6784\u5efa\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5728\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u5408\u7406\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u503c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfMMO\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

However, current systems often fail to accurately translate user intent into satisfactory story outputs due to a lack of fine-grained control and unclear input specifications, limiting their applicability. To address this, we propose TaleFrame, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with human-computer interaction (HCI) to generate stories through structured information, enabling precise control over the generation process. The innovation of TaleFrame lies in decomposing the story structure into four basic units: entities, events, relationships, and story outline. We leverage the Tinystories dataset, parsing and constructing a preference dataset consisting of 9,851 JSON-formatted entries, which is then used to fine-tune a local Llama model. By employing this JSON2Story approach, structured data is transformed into coherent stories. TaleFrame also offers an intuitive interface that supports users in creating and editing entities and events and generates stories through the structured framework. Users can control these units through simple interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, attach, and connect), thus influencing the details and progression of the story. The generated stories can be evaluated across seven dimensions (e.g., creativity, structural integrity), with the system providing suggestions for refinement based on these evaluations. Users can iteratively adjust the story until a satisfactory result is achieved. Finally, we conduct quantitative evaluation and user studies that demonstrate the usefulness of TaleFrame.

Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u6765\u533a\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u6a21\u7cca\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5929\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u9002\u5408\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e0e\u540e\u671f\u5916\u89c2\u7ec6\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u9636\u6bb5\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u7528\u4e8e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u8fd1\u671f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u53d8\u5f62\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u8ddf\u8e2a\u751a\u81f3\u76f8\u540c\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5929\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u533a\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

Here, we provide a proof-of-concept analysis that shows how machine learning (ML) methods can be applied to a simple macroeconomic model of the Doughnut. First, we show how ML methods can be used to find policy parameters that are consistent with 'living within the Doughnut'. Second, we show how a reinforcement learning agent can identify the optimal trajectory towards desired policies in the parameter space. The approaches we test, which include a Random Forest Classifier and $Q$-learning, are frugal ML methods that are able to find policy parameter combinations that achieve both environmental and social sustainability.

Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors.

However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

Results show that agent-identified relationships achieve roughly 60-70% accuracy, and their induced trading strategies earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons, highlighting the ability of agentic AI and large language models to uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u805a\u7c7b\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5e02\u573a\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u7cfb\u6784\u5efa\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728Polymarket\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u7ea620%\u7684\u5468\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u5b58\u5728\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cd\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u9690\u542b\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u548c\u9690\u85cf\u77db\u76fe\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e02\u573a\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u5e02\u573a\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u8981AI\u6280\u672f\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f5c\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u5408\u540c\u6587\u672c\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e3b\u9898\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7fa4\u7ec4\uff1b2) \u5728\u7fa4\u7ec4\u5185\u8bc6\u522b\u5e02\u573a\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u540c\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff09\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff09\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b3) \u5c06\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728Polymarket\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAI\u4ee3\u7406\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523060-70%\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u7cfb\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5468\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u83b7\u5f97\u7ea620%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u56de\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86AI\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e02\u573a\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u7cfb\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field.

Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability.

This is mainly due to the difficulty of curating high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs, a limitation prevalent in the languages spoken across the African continent and other regions. Current approaches, such as automated translation and synthetic data generation, frequently yield outputs that lack fluency or even orthographic consistency. In this paper, we introduce InstructLR, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs. Our approach integrates LLM-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering mechanism: an automated filtering layer based on retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting, and a human-in-the-loop validation layer. Drawing inspiration from benchmarks such as MMLU in task definition, InstructLR has facilitated the creation of three multi-domain instruction benchmarks: ZarmaInstruct-50k, BambaraInstruct-50k, and FulfuldeInstruct-50k.", "AI": {"tldr": "InstructLR\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u8d28\u91cf\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\uff08\u81ea\u52a8RAG\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff09\uff0c\u5df2\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6307\u4ee4\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u804a\u5929\u754c\u9762\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u6d41\u7545\u751a\u81f3\u62fc\u5199\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "InstructLR\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u8d28\u91cf\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7684n-shot\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5c42\uff1b2\uff09\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5c42\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4eceMMLU\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u6c72\u53d6\u7075\u611f\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6307\u4ee4\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1aZarmaInstruct-50k\u3001BambaraInstruct-50k\u548cFulfuldeInstruct-50k\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5305\u542b5\u4e07\u6761\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "InstructLR\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6539\u5584LLMs\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "R-Few\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6311\u6218\u8005-\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u5e38\u56e0\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u6f14\u5316\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u505c\u6ede\u6216\u9000\u5316\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f1a\u5f3a\u5316\u81ea\u8eab\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4f4e\u71b5\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faR-Few\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6311\u6218\u8005-\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u6311\u6218\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u793a\u4f8b\u6307\u5bfc\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u96be\u5ea6\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e0b\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4eba\u5de5\u548c\u5408\u6210\u793a\u4f8b\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u3002Qwen3-8B-Base\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4R-Zero\u63d0\u53473.0\u5206\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f7f\u752820\u500d\u4eba\u5de5\u6570\u636e\u7684General-Reasoner\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6311\u6218\u8005\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "R-Few\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries.

Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods.

Such approaches compute an advantage value for each sample, reflecting better or worse performance than expected, thereby yielding both positive and negative signals for training. However, the indiscriminate mixing of the two signals in existing methods, especially from the early stages, may lead to ambiguous guidance and limited gains. To address this issue, we propose **CAPO** (**C**urriculum **A**dvantage **P**olicy **O**ptimization), an adaptive curriculum mechanism based on advantage signals. The proposed mechanism bootstraps imitation learning with positive-only advantage samples to establish robust foundations, and subsequently introduces negative signals to cultivate discriminative capabilities, thereby improving generalization across complex scenarios. Compatible with diverse optimization methods including GRPO, PPO, RLOO, and Reinforce++, our method consistently achieves stable and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks, and further generalizes effectively to multimodal Graphical User Interface (GUI) reasoning scenarios, establishing itself as a versatile and robust optimization framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAPO\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u52bf\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u4f18\u52bf\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u518d\u5f15\u5165\u8d1f\u4fe1\u53f7\u57f9\u517b\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0d\u52a0\u533a\u5206\u5730\u6df7\u5408\u6b63\u8d1f\u4f18\u52bf\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6539\u5584LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCAPO\uff08\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4f18\u52bf\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfe\u7a0b\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u9996\u5148\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u4f18\u52bf\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7a33\u5065\u57fa\u7840\uff1b2\uff09\u968f\u540e\u9010\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u8d1f\u4f18\u52bf\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u57f9\u517b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08GRPO\u3001PPO\u3001RLOO\u3001Reinforce++\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001GUI\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CAPO\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4fe1\u53f7\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "VACoT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u53d8\u6362\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728OCR\u76f8\u5173\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u7ee7\u7eed\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVACoT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u5982\u53bb\u566a\u7b49\u540e\u5904\u7406\u53d8\u6362\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728OCR\u76f8\u5173\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165AdvOCR\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u5c55\u793a\u540e\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "VACoT\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

They also overlook the utilization of certain privileged information, which may encompass additional empathetic content. In response, we introduce an advanced multi-modal empathy prediction method integrating video, audio, and text information. The method comprises the Multi-Modal Empathy Prediction and Supervisory Documentation Assisted Training. We use pre-trained networks in the empathy prediction network to extract features from various modalities, followed by a cross-modal fusion. This process yields a multi-modal feature representation, which is employed to predict empathy labels. To enhance the extraction of text features, we incorporate supervisory documents as privileged information during the assisted training phase. Specifically, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify potential topic distributions to constrain text features.

TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ResNet-50\u548cSqueezeNet\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u80ba\u7ed3\u6838\uff0cSqueezeNet\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u738789% vs 73%\uff09\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u80ba\u7ed3\u6838\u8bca\u65ad\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u5730\u533a\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u6765\u6539\u5584\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Kaggle\u76844,200\u5f20\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ResNet-50\u548cSqueezeNet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5272\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u5927\u5c0f\u7b49\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "SqueezeNet\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eResNet-50\uff1a\u635f\u593132% vs 54%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u738789% vs 73%\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u738798% vs 88%\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u738780% vs 52%\uff0cF1\u5206\u657087% vs 65%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80ba\u7ed3\u6838\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5982SqueezeNet\u9002\u5408\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u5c0f\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5168\u7403\u80ba\u7ed3\u6838\u9632\u6cbb\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "relevance": 25.0}}

While it is known that improving fairness can affect predictive performance, little is known about how fairness improvements influence explainability, an essential ingredient for clinical trust. Clinicians may hesitate to rely on a model whose explanations shift after fairness constraints are applied. In this study, we examine how enhancing fairness through bias mitigation techniques reshapes Shapley-based feature rankings. We quantify changes in feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets: pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk.

We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor, multi-agent, and plugin-based academic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.

One-way ANOVA reveals a significant primacy effect for BERTScore across all stances, indicating that summaries are more semantically aligned with the first-seen article.

Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features.

We show that in the \\emph{testable learning} model of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan [RV23], membership queries cannot decrease the time complexity of testable learning algorithms beyond the complexity of sample-only distribution-specific learning. In the testable learning model, the learner must output a hypothesis whenever the data distribution satisfies a desired property, and if it outputs a hypothesis, the hypothesis must be near-optimal.\n  We give a general reduction from sample-based \\emph{refutation} of boolean concept classes, as presented in [Vadhan17, KL18], to testable learning with queries (TL-Q). This yields lower bounds for TL-Q via the reduction from learning to refutation given in [KL18]. The result is that, relative to a concept class and a distribution family, no $m$-sample TL-Q algorithm can be super-polynomially more time-efficient than the best $m$-sample PAC learner.\n  Finally, we define a class of ``statistical'' MQ algorithms that encompasses many known distribution-specific MQ learners, such as those based on influence estimation or subcube-conditional statistical queries.

Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues. This mechanism enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution.

To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e867\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u8f7bLLM\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u504f\u89c1\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dSLERP\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u63d2\u503c\u6743\u91cd\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u4f1a\u7ee7\u627f\u5e76\u653e\u5927\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91LLM\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8c03\u67e5\u4e867\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, Nearswap\uff09\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eGPT\u3001LLaMA\u548cQwen\u5bb6\u65cf\u768413\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f7f\u75283\u4e2a\u504f\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08BBQ\u3001BOLD\u3001HONEST\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5728SuperGLUE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u504f\u89c1\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5927\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9605\u8bfb\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u3002\u5728\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0cLinear\u3001SLERP\u548cNearswap\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e2d\u7b49\u63d2\u503c\u6743\u91cd\u7684SLERP\u662f\u6700\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u5316\u6216\u4e0d\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u8981\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9000\u5316\u3002SLERP\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u6743\u91cd\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \\textbf{S}tyle-\\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{GE}neralization framework (\\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAGE\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u98ce\u683c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6cdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u51bb\u7ed3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "SAGE\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u9690\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u8de8\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6784\u5efa\u6e90\u57df\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8986\u76d6\u5e7f\u6cdb\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u3002\u7136\u540e\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98ce\u683c\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u89e6\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u534f\u8c03\u56fe\u50cf\u5916\u89c2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAGE\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SAGE\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u51bb\u7ed3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u4e0e\u672a\u89c1\u57df\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\\leq$2\\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed.

To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics.

To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above).

However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL).

Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations.

Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies.

Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline. These results show that retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAM-OL\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u62a4\u8fc7\u53bb\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff0c\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u5f53\u524d\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d41\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRAM-OL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u8fc7\u53bb\u6837\u672c\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u3002\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5f53\u524d\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\u5f53\u524d\u6837\u672c\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u3002\u5305\u542b\u6734\u7d20\u91cd\u653e\u548c\u95e8\u63a7\u91cd\u653e\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u8fc7\u65f6\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7535\u529b\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3001\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u8377\u548c\u822a\u73ed\u5ef6\u8bef\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u5468\u671f\u6f02\u79fb\u6d41\u4e0a\uff0cRAM-OL\u5c06\u9884\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea67\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u822a\u73ed\u6d41\u4e0a\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0e\u7eaf\u5728\u7ebf\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u662f\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0b\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u6a21\u5f0f\u91cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u540e\u6094\u5e38\u6570\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLM\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u66ff\u6362\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5d4c\u5957\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\uff08\u5904\u7406\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\uff08\u5904\u7406\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u66f4\u6df1\u5d4c\u5957\u5c42\u6b21\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e0d\u540c\u4e14\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u66ff\u6362\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u9012\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u5b50\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u66ff\u6362\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5e03\u5c14\u4ee3\u6570\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u547d\u9898\u903b\u8f91\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u90fd\u6709\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d85\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u6df1\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u8870\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u66f4\u6df1\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ef4\u6301\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6808\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5c42\u5d4c\u5957\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u66ff\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels.

However, the system often faces delays and fluctuations in ridership volume, which negatively affect efficiency and passenger satisfaction. To further understand this phenomenon, this paper compares the performance of existing and unique methods to determine the best approach in predicting gated station entries in the subway system (a proxy for subway usage) and the number of delays in the overall MBTA system. To do so, this research considers factors that tend to affect public transportation, such as day of week, season, pressure, wind speed, average temperature, and precipitation. This paper evaluates the performance of 10 statistical and machine learning models on predicting next-day subway usage. On predicting delay count, the number of models is extended to 11 per day by introducing a self-exciting point process model, representing a unique application of a point-process framework for MBTA delay modeling. This research involves experimenting with the selective inclusion of features to determine feature importance, testing model accuracy via Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Remarkably, it is found that providing either day of week or season data has a more substantial benefit to predictive accuracy compared to weather data; in fact, providing weather data generally worsens performance, suggesting a tendency of models to overfit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u5730\u94c1\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u95f8\u673a\u8fdb\u5165\u91cf\uff09\u548cMBTA\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ef6\u8bef\u6570\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e5\u671f\u548c\u5b63\u8282\u7279\u5f81\u6bd4\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u66f4\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002", "motivation": "MBTA\uff08\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u516c\u5171\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u7ecf\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u5ef6\u8bef\u548c\u5ba2\u6d41\u6ce2\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e58\u5ba2\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u5730\u94c1\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5ef6\u8bef\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u8425\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8610\u4e2a\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6b21\u65e5\u5730\u94c1\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca11\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u6fc0\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8bef\u6570\u91cf\u3002\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u65e5\u671f\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u548cRMSE\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e5\u671f\u6216\u5b63\u8282\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u66f4\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002\u81ea\u6fc0\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u72ec\u7279\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eMBTA\u5ef6\u8bef\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u516c\u5171\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u65e5\u671f\u3001\u5b63\u8282\uff09\u6bd4\u5929\u6c14\u7279\u5f81\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5ef6\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "relevance": 25.0}}

Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%.

To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation (\"thinking with images\"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks.

Speculative decoding is one of the most direct and effective approaches for accelerating generation. It follows a draft-verify paradigm, where a lightweight draft model proposes several candidate tokens and the target model verifies them. However, we find that as the context length grows, verification becomes the dominant bottleneck. To further accelerate speculative decoding in long-context generation, we introduce SpecPV, a self-speculative decoding approach that performs fast verification using partial key-value states (KV) and periodically applies full verification to eliminate accumulated errors. We validate SpecPV across multiple long-context benchmarks and models, including LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-series.

Understanding how specific training data contributes to a model's output is critical. We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology.

Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.\n  We have open-sourced all the code, data, and baseline implementation at: https://github.com/oneal2000/UniFact/", "AI": {"tldr": "UniFact\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1(FV)\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b(HD)\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u770b\u4f3c\u6d41\u7545\u4f46\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u8fd9\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b(HD)\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1(FV)\u4e24\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5404\u81ea\u72ec\u7acb\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u88c2\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5171\u540c\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniFact\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0FV\u548cHD\u5728\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u6ca1\u6709\u54ea\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u666e\u904d\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b2) HD\u548cFV\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u65b9\u9762\uff1b3) \u6574\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48FV\u548cHD\u5206\u5316\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u652f\u6301\u5b83\u4eec\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Albeit with some advancement, we find that the performance of most existing offline FRL methods drops dramatically when provided with mixed-quality data, that is, the logging behaviors (offline data) are collected by policies with varying qualities across clients. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a new vote-based offline FRL framework, named FOVA. It exploits a \\emph{vote mechanism} to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "WISE\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e13\u5bb6\u793e\u4f1a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff09\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Dawid-Skene\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u73872-7%", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bed\u6599\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\uff08MAD\uff09\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f18\u52bf\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5065\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7eaf\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22MAD\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a0\u6743\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e13\u5bb6\u793e\u4f1a\uff08WISE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u5668\uff08\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5206\u914d\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53cd\u9988\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Dawid-Skene\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fa9\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u6743\u91cd\uff1b3\uff09\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u6784\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u7684\u8fa9\u8bba\u534f\u8bae\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728SMART-840\u3001VisualPuzzles\u3001EvoChart-QA\u548c\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684SMART-840++\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cWISE\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u548cLLM\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684MAD\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u53472-7%\u3002", "conclusion": "WISE\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u8fa9\u8bba\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5229\u7528LLMs\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "StockMem\uff1a\u4e8b\u4ef6-\u53cd\u601d\u53cc\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c34\u5e73\u6574\u5408\u548c\u7eb5\u5411\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b0\u95fb\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e8b\u4ef6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u53cd\u601d\u5e93\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u80a1\u7968\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u80a1\u7968\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u5e02\u573a\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u65b0\u95fb\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u901a\u7528\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4ef7\u683c\u53d8\u52a8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStockMem\u4e8b\u4ef6-\u53cd\u601d\u53cc\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u65b0\u95fb\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5904\u7406\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1b2\uff09\u6c34\u5e73\u6574\u5408\u6574\u5408\u6bcf\u65e5\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1b3\uff09\u7eb5\u5411\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6355\u6349\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6f14\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u53cd\u6620\u5e02\u573a\u9884\u671f\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u4e8b\u4ef6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff1b4\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e8b\u4ef6-\u4ef7\u683c\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u56e0\u679c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u53cd\u601d\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff1b5\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u68c0\u7d22\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5386\u53f2\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f53\u524d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8fc7\u53bb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eStockMem\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5f71\u54cd\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u94fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "StockMem\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u4ef6-\u53cd\u601d\u53cc\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

This study proposes TriLex, a three-stage retrieval augmented framework that unifies corpus-based extraction, cross lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven lexical refinement to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages. Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings. Both models outperform traditional machine learning baselines, and ensemble analyses further enhance precision and robustness.

However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models.

In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines.

Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration.

While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $\u03bd_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $\u0398$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $\u03ba$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.\n  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $\u03ba> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.\n  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u7684\u6a21\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4fdd\u8bc1\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u3001\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3aGVU\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u7684AAI\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u6d41\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u3001\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGenerator-Verifier-Updater (GVU)\u9012\u5f52\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u5411\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7cfb\u6570\u03ba\u4e3a\u80fd\u529b\u6cdb\u51fd\u6cbf\u8be5\u6d41\u7684\u674e\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4fdd\u8bc1\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff08\u8c31\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u5fc5\u987b\u8db3\u591f\u5c0f\uff08\u8003\u8651\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u6b65\u957f\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u3002\u5c06STaR\u3001SPIN\u3001Reflexion\u3001GANs\u3001AlphaZero\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u6ee1\u8db3\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7684GVU\u7b97\u5b50\u62d3\u6251\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u89c6\u4e3aGVU\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's \"Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment\" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT.

However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "GUI Exploration Lab\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8eGUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5355\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GUI\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cGUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4ece\u5355\u5c4f\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5411\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5c4f\u5e55\u5bfc\u822a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684GUI\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982PC\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u4e13\u6709\u7684\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u5168\u9762\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GUI Exploration Lab\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5c4f\u5e55\u3001\u56fe\u6807\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7528\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b2\uff09\u5355\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3\uff09\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bd5\u9519\u9f13\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9759\u6001\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u3002\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5355\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u5c4f\u5e55\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728GUI\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u548c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002GUI Exploration Lab\u73af\u5883\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u771f\u5b9eGUI\u73af\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

Allocating spaces for on-street parking, further hinders traffic flow, by limiting the effective road width available for driving. With the advancement of vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies, we explore how the impact of on-street parking on traffic congestion could be minimized, by dynamically configuring on-street parking spaces. Towards that end, we formulate dynamic on-street parking space configuration as an optimization problem, and we follow a data driven approach, considering the nature of our problem. Our proposed solution comprises a two-layer multi agent reinforcement learning based framework, which is inherently scalable to large road networks. The lane level agents are responsible for deciding the optimal parking space configuration for each lane, and we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning architecture which effectively utilizes long short term memory networks and graph attention networks to capture the spatio-temporal correlations evident in the given problem. The block level agents control the actions of the lane level agents and maintain a sufficient level of parking around the block. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using SUMO, on both synthetic data as well as real-world data from the city of Melbourne. Our experiments show that the proposed framework could reduce the average travel time loss of vehicles significantly, reaching upto 47%, with a negligible increase in the walking distance for parking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u8fb9\u505c\u8f66\u4f4d\u914d\u7f6e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8f66\u8f86\u5e73\u5747\u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u635f\u5931\u8fbe47%", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u62e5\u5835\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u8def\u8fb9\u505c\u8f66\u5360\u7528\u9053\u8def\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6076\u5316\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u3002\u968f\u7740\u8f66\u8def\u534f\u540c\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u8fb9\u505c\u8f66\u4f4d\u914d\u7f6e\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u62e5\u5835", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u8f66\u9053\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u5408LSTM\u548c\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u533a\u5757\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u8f66\u9053\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u533a\u5757\u5468\u8fb9\u505c\u8f66\u4f4d\u5145\u8db3", "result": "\u5728SUMO\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u58a8\u5c14\u672c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5e73\u5747\u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u635f\u5931\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe47%\uff0c\u800c\u505c\u8f66\u6b65\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u8fb9\u505c\u8f66\u4f4d\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848", "relevance": 35.0}}

Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \\textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering.

However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered.

While several of these data-centric strategies reliably improve training efficiency and downstream performance, others fail to provide meaningful gains -- most notably self-generated synthetic data, which often increases dataset volume without enhancing model capability.\n  We formalize data curation as reweighting the sampling distribution and map its effect onto the eigenstructure of the data-induced operator. Our first main result shows that \\textbf{static pruning induces a bounded operator and therefore cannot change the spectral tail exponent}; it provides at most finite-region improvements and cannot alter asymptotic neural scaling. Our second result analyzes \\textbf{time-dependent data curation}, showing that an ideal oracle capable of tracking spectral residuals and continuously re-normalizing the tail can provably accelerate learning -- although practical systems can only approximate this behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u89d2\u5ea6\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u9759\u6001\u526a\u679d\u53ea\u80fd\u6709\u9650\u6539\u8fdb\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6539\u53d8\u6e10\u8fd1\u795e\u7ecf\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u4f46\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u526a\u679d\u3001\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u3001RLHF\u7b49\uff09\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5f80\u5f80\u589e\u52a0\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u800c\u4e0d\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6548\u679c\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6570\u636e\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\uff1a1\uff09\u5206\u6790\u9759\u6001\u526a\u679d\u5bf9\u7b97\u5b50\u8c31\u5c3e\u6307\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b2\uff09\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u7406\u60f3oracle\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u9759\u6001\u526a\u679d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6709\u754c\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6539\u53d8\u8c31\u5c3e\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u9650\u533a\u57df\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u6e10\u8fd1\u795e\u7ecf\u7f29\u653e\uff1b2\uff09\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\uff08\u80fd\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8c31\u6b8b\u5dee\u5e76\u8fde\u7eed\u91cd\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c3e\u90e8\uff09\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ea\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8fd9\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5176\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u9759\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u52a8\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u903c\u8fd1\u7406\u60f3oracle\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\\% and 13\\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents.

Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578bLightHCG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5377\u79efVAE\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c1193-99%\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u9752\u5149\u773c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3001\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u62df\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u795e\u7ecf\u635f\u4f24\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709AI\u6a21\u578b\u5982VGG16\u3001ViT\u7b49\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9752\u5149\u773c\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u95f4\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLightHCG\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79efVAE\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6f5c\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u91c7\u7528HSIC\uff08\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279-\u65bd\u5bc6\u7279\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u51c6\u5219\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u89c6\u795e\u7ecf\u533a\u57df\u5185\u9752\u5149\u773c\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u95f4\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "LightHCG\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982InceptionV3\u3001MobileNetV2\u3001VGG16\uff09\u51cf\u5c1193-99%\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3aAI\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between the source and target domain, simply merging the data from two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively sharing source domain samples that exhibit dynamics alignment with the target domain. However, these approaches focus solely on dynamics alignment and overlook \\textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain. In this paper, we first demonstrate that both dynamics alignment and value alignment are essential for policy learning, by examining the limitations of the current theoretical framework for cross-domain RL and establishing a concrete sub-optimality gap of a policy trained on the source domain and evaluated on the target domain. Motivated by the theoretical insights, we propose to selectively share those source domain samples with both high dynamics and value alignment and present our \\textbf{\\underline{D}}ynamics- and \\textbf{\\underline{V}}alue-aligned \\textbf{\\underline{D}}ata \\textbf{\\underline{F}}iltering (DVDF) method. We design a range of dynamics shift settings, including kinematic and morphology shifts, and evaluate DVDF on various tasks and datasets, as well as in challenging extremely low-data settings where the target domain dataset contains only 5,000 transitions.

While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56db\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982CoT\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u80fd\u63d0\u53475-10%\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u82f1\u8bed\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u5355\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f46\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfcLLMs\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u56db\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u57285\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u30013\u4e2aLLMs\u548c3\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc71000\u4e07\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u5355\u5143\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u6240\u6709\u6307\u68075-10%\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods.

Prior works have focused mainly on evaluation of LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setup relatively unexplored, both from capability and safety perspectives. Our work addresses this gap. We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\\% for both benign and harmful tasks. Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from $\\sim$5\\% to $\\sim$40\\% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from $\\sim$80\\% to $\\sim$10\\% at 200K tokens. Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks.

In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official baselines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vector Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree as baseline methods. We also utilized transformer-based models such as DistilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM-RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed baseline methods for the subtasks, except for DistilBERT. Among the transformer-based models, BanglaBERT produces the best performance for both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size, BanglaBERT outperforms both m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, which suggests language-specific pre-training is very important.

Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization.

Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this task.While traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events. This evaluation confirms that the TabGRU model can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under the tested conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTabGRU\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u548cBiGRU\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1a\u5fae\u6ce2\u94fe\u8def(CML)\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u964d\u96e8\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u745e\u5178\u54e5\u5fb7\u5821\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e8b\u4ef6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u57ce\u5e02\u964d\u96e8\u76d1\u6d4b\u5bf9\u5efa\u8bbe\u97e7\u6027\u667a\u6167\u57ce\u5e02\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684CML\u964d\u96e8\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff08\u5982\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\uff09\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTabGRU\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u6355\u6349\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u548cBiGRU\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c60\u5316\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u745e\u5178\u54e5\u5fb7\u5821\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTabGRU\u5728Torp\u7ad9\u70b9R\u00b2=0.91\uff0cBarl\u7ad9\u70b9R\u00b2=0.96\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u5cf0\u503c\u964d\u96e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "TabGRU\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aCML\u57ce\u5e02\u964d\u96e8\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9785\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4bLLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u56fa\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u8bef\u800c\u975e\u771f\u76f8\u5bfb\u6c42", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u5f3a\u5316\u4fe1\u5ff5\u56fa\u5316\u548c\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u771f\u76f8\u5bfb\u6c42\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u56fa\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u9785\u6027\u8d28\u6784\u5efa\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56de\u5f52\u8bc4\u5206\uff08Martingale Score\uff09\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u662f\u5426\u8fdd\u53cd\u7406\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u539f\u5219\u3002\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u5224\u65ad\u3001\u5b66\u672f\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4fe1\u5ff5\u56fa\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6b63\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6613\u53d7\u4fe1\u5ff5\u56fa\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\u548c\u9886\u57df\u3002\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Martingale Score\u5728\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u9886\u57df\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4fe1\u5ff5\u56fa\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0cMartingale Score\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u771f\u76f8\u5bfb\u6c42\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset.

However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \\textbf{D}ual-\\textbf{RO}bust \\textbf{C}ross-domain \\textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm.

We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $\u03b3{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "SchED\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u5168\u8de8\u5ea6logit\u8fb9\u754c\u5e76\u5728\u8fbe\u5230\u8fdb\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u505c\u6b62\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b03.8-4.0\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630199.8-100%\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901fdLLM\u89e3\u7801\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "SchED\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u805a\u5408\u5168\u8de8\u5ea6logit\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b2) \u5f53\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8fdb\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u505c\u6b62\u89e3\u7801\uff1b3) \u5728\u591a\u4e2adLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\uff08Dream\u548cLLaDA\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u5ea7\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b03.8-4.0\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630199.8-100%\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u5728\u57fa\u5ea7\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u52a0\u901f\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u755999.1-100%\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe2.34\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002SchED\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SchED\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u4f7fdLLM\u89e3\u7801\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002\u71b5\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u7684\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8eSchED\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \\& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9886\u57df\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5176\u521b\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u540c\u7b49\u91cd\u8981\u3002nuScenes\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86AV\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63ed\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u987enuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u7248\u672cnuImages\u548cPanoptic nuScenes\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u672a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u5206\u6790nuScenes\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u6982\u8ff0\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5b98\u65b9\u548c\u975e\u5b98\u65b9\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u793e\u533a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6587\u732e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u8c03\u67e5\u3002", "conclusion": "nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u540e\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u793e\u533a\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u51b2\u7a81\u8c03\u89e3\u5458\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8c03\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efaReddit\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0API\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u65e5\u76ca\u6210\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u6d41\u7684\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4fc3\u8fdb\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u548c\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u524d\u6cbf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u80fd\u5426\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5ba1\u6838\u8005\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u5728\u7ebf\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u8c03\u89e3\u5458\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u8c03\u89e3\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5224\u65ad\uff08\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\uff09\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08\u751f\u6210\u5bcc\u6709\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u3001\u7f13\u89e3\u7d27\u5f20\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u578bReddit\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u539f\u5219\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAPI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u540c\u65f6\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u793e\u4ea4\u8c03\u89e3\u65b0\u5174\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u793e\u4ea4\u8c03\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002API\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8c03\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

We attribute this hardware-model mismatch to two primary factors: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms, which fail to utilize the high arithmetic throughput of NPUs. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture co-designed for integer-only inference. We replace the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which ensures bounded activation distributions for stable INT4/8/16 quantization. Complementing this, our language backbone integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles with Transformer layers, employing efficient gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity. This hybrid design eliminates the heavy memory I/O overhead of Key-Value caching during generation. Our approach delivers substantial efficiency gains, reducing quantization error of vision encoder by up to 7x and end-to-end latency by 14x compared to conventional baselines. The AutoNeural also delivers 3x decoding speed and 4x longer context window than the baseline. We validate these improvements via a real-world automotive case study on the Qualcomm SA8295P SoC, demonstrating real-time performance for cockpit applications.

As a consequence, they cannot natively handle large multi floor buildings and require scenes to be split into individual floors before processing, which removes global spatial context that is essential for reasoning about structures such as staircases that connect multiple levels. In this work, we introduce HouseLayout3D, a real world benchmark designed to support progress toward full building scale layout estimation, including multiple floors and architecturally intricate spaces. We also present MultiFloor3D, a simple training free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods and already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both our benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.

However, computing gradients via implicit differentiation requires solving a linear system with Hessian terms, which is both compute- and memory-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm that computes the gradient using only first-order information. The key insight is to rewrite the differentiable optimization as a bilevel optimization problem and leverage recent advances in bilevel methods. Specifically, we introduce an active-set Lagrangian hypergradient oracle that avoids Hessian evaluations and provides finite-time, non-asymptotic approximation guarantees. We show that an approximate hypergradient can be computed using only first-order information in $\\tilde{\\oo}(1)$ time, leading to an overall complexity of $\\tilde{\\oo}(\u03b4^{-1}\u03b5^{-3})$ for constrained bilevel optimization, which matches the best known rate for non-smooth non-convex optimization.

However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences.

Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoCoP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u3001\u95ed\u73af\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5c42\u5206\u6790\uff08\u8bcd\u6c47\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5224\u65ad\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f26\u7406\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6bd2\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5448\u5f3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e8b\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u5c42\uff1a1) \u8bcd\u6c47\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c2) \u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u7ef4\u6301\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u5373\u53ef\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4f26\u7406\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPT-4-Turbo\u548cDeepSeek\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u9053\u5fb7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6bd2\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5448\u5f3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173(rET = -0.81, p<0.001)\uff0c\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u5173(rEL\u22480)\u3002\u8868\u660e\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "MoCoP\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u5185\u7701\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u9053\u5fb7\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses.

However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss.

Furthermore, social context plays a critical role in understanding user behavior, yet is often overlooked in mobile sensing research. To address these gaps, we introduce LogMe, a mobile sensing application that passively collects smartphone sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and rotation vector) and prompts users for hourly self-reports capturing both sedentary activity and social context. Using this dual-label dataset, we propose DySTAN (Dynamic Cross-Stitch with Task Attention Network), a multi-task learning framework that jointly classifies both context dimensions from shared sensor inputs. It integrates task-specific layers with cross-task attention to model subtle distinctions effectively. DySTAN improves sedentary activity macro F1 scores by 21.8% over a single-task CNN-BiLSTM-GRU (CBG) model and by 8.2% over the strongest multi-task baseline, Sluice Network (SN).

Investigating Audio-Video Joint Denoising for Video Generation", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": "Project page at https://jianzongwu.github.io/projects/does-hearing-help-seeing/", "summary": "Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions.

However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\\textbf{2.5$\\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \\$0.059 to \\$0.024. The upfront demonstration cost amortizes after just 843 episodes, yielding cumulative savings exceeding \\$34,900 at deployment scale (1M episodes). On AppWorld, a complex agent benchmark requiring multi-step API workflows, we shift the Pareto frontier by achieving a $\\textbf{2$\\times$ cost reduction}$ at iso-accuracy.

Dysfluencies and fluency-shaping artifacts are often overlooked, resulting in non-verbatim transcriptions with limited clinical and research value. We propose a parameter-efficient adaptation method to decode dysfluencies and fluency modifications as special tokens within transcriptions, evaluated on simulated (LibriStutter, English) and natural (KSoF, German) stuttered speech datasets. To mitigate ASR performance disparities and bias towards English, we introduce a multi-step fine-tuning strategy with language-adaptive pretraining. Tokenization analysis further highlights the tokenizer's English-centric bias, which poses challenges for improving performance on German data. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of lightweight adaptation techniques for dysfluency-aware ASR while exposing key limitations in multilingual E2E systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u5f55\u4e2d\u89e3\u7801\u53e3\u5403\u548c\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u4fee\u6539\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u6b8a\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u53e3\u5403\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b(ASR)\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u53e3\u5403\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u5f55\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u53e3\u5403\u548c\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u5851\u9020\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4ef7\u503c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u53e3\u5403\u548c\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u4fee\u6539\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u8f6c\u5f55\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6b65\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u8a00\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7bASR\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\u504f\u5411\uff1b3) \u5728\u6a21\u62df(LibriStutter, \u82f1\u8bed)\u548c\u81ea\u7136(KSoF, \u5fb7\u8bed)\u53e3\u5403\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "1) \u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u8bc6\u522b\u53e3\u5403\u7684ASR\u6709\u6548\uff1b2) \u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u5411\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u5fb7\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff1b3) \u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u53e3\u5403\u611f\u77e5\u7684ASR\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u5411\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SEER-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c3DSPMR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u987a\u5e8f\u6027\u5177\u8eabAI\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u589e\u5f3aMLLMs\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5177\u8eabAI\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u987a\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u590d\u7528\u4e4b\u524d\u63a2\u7d22\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u652f\u6301\u540e\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u5b9e\u9645\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e863DSPMR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u63a2\u7d22\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u663e\u5f0f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u57fa\u4e8eMLLM\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86SEER-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u987a\u5e8f\u6027\u5177\u8eab\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u5177\u8eab\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bfc\u822a\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e863DSPMR\u5728\u987a\u5e8f\u6027EQA\u548cEMN\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u987a\u5e8f\u6027\u5177\u8eabAI\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76843DSPMR\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86MLLMs\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

One strategy is to consider the primal formulation of the learning problem by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space using tensor-product structured polynomial and Fourier features. The curse of dimensionality due to these tensor-product features was effectively solved by a tensor network reparameterization of the model parameters. However, another important aspect of model training - identifying optimal feature hyperparameters - has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard cross-validation approach. In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method. We prove the effectiveness of the FL model through experiments on real data of various dimensionality and scale. The results show that the FL model can be consistently trained 3-5 times faster than and have the prediction quality on par with a standard cross-validated model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u591a\u5206\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\uff08CPD\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb3-5\u500d\u4e14\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u7acb\u65b9\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5f81\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u591a\u5206\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\uff08CPD\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cdCPD\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\uff08ALS\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cFL\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb3-5\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FL\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684CPD\u8868\u793a\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

This study quantitatively compared human responses with those of eight LLM-generated social personas (e.g., Male, Female, Muslim, Political Supporter) within a low-resource environment like Bangladesh, using culturally specific questions. Results show human responses significantly outperform all LLMs in answering questions, and across all matrices of persona perception, with particularly large gaps in empathy and credibility. Furthermore, LLM-generated content exhibited a systematic bias along the lines of the ``Pollyanna Principle'', scoring measurably higher in positive sentiment ($\u03a6_{avg} = 5.99$ for LLMs vs. $5.60$ for Humans). These findings suggest that LLM personas do not accurately reflect the authentic experience of real people in resource-scarce environments. It is essential to validate LLM personas against real-world human data to ensure their alignment and reliability before deploying them in social science research.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u89d2\u8272\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u56de\u7b54\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e14\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u79ef\u6781\u504f\u89c1", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210AI\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u3001\u6587\u5316\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u6bd4\u8f83LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u89d2\u8272\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u56de\u7b54\u4e0e8\u79cdLLM\u751f\u6210\u793e\u4f1a\u89d2\u8272\uff08\u5982\u7537\u6027\u3001\u5973\u6027\u3001\u7a46\u65af\u6797\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u652f\u6301\u8005\uff09\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u5206\u6790\u5305\u62ec\u89d2\u8272\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u56de\u7b54\u5728\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709LLM\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5dee\u8ddd\u5c24\u5176\u5927\u3002LLM\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u79ef\u6781\u504f\u89c1\uff08Pollyanna\u539f\u5219\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u79ef\u6781\u60c5\u611f\u5f97\u5206\u66f4\u9ad8\uff08LLM: 5.99 vs \u4eba\u7c7b: 5.60\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u89d2\u8272\u4e0d\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72LLM\u89d2\u8272\u524d\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "TGDD\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "TGDD\u5c06\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u6355\u6349\u6f14\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u7ea6\u675f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u7c7b\u522b\u91cd\u53e0\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTGDD\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e865.0%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "TGDD\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53c8\u5177\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Using CUDA execution speed as the RL reward, CUDA-L2 automatically optimizes HGEMM kernels across 1,000 configurations. CUDA-L2 systematically outperforms major matmul baselines to date, from the widely-used {\\it torch.matmul} to state-of-the-art Nvidia's closed-source libraries, i.e., {\\it cuBLAS}, {\\it cuBLASLt}. In offline mode, where kernels are executed consecutively without time intervals, CUDA-L2 yields +22.0\\% over {\\it torch.matmul} on average; +19.2\\% over {\\it cuBLAS} using the optimal layout configuration (normal-normal NN and transposed-normal TN); +16.8\\% over {\\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, which queries {\\it cuBLASLt} library and selects the algorithm based on the heuristic's suggestion; and +11.4\\% over the most competitive {\\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} model, which selects the fastest algorithm from up to 100 candidates from {\\it cuBLASLt}'s suggestions. In server mode, where kernels are executed at random intervals simulating real-time inference, the speedups further increase to +28.7\\%, +26.0\\%, +22.4\\%, and +15.9\\% for {\\it torch.matmul}, {\\it cuBLAS}, {\\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, and {\\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} respectively. CUDA-L2 shows that even the most performance-critical, heavily-optimized kernels like HGEMM can be improved through LLM-guided RL automation by systematically exploring configuration spaces at scales impractical for humans.

However, these connectomes are high-dimensional and densely interconnected, which makes them difficult to interpret and analyze at scale. While low-dimensional spaces like PCA and autoencoders are often used to capture major sources of variation, their latent spaces are generally continuous and cannot fully reflect the mixed nature of variability in connectomes, which include both continuous (e.g., connectivity strength) and discrete factors (e.g., imaging site). Motivated by this, we propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a hybrid latent space that jointly models the discrete and continuous components. We analyze a large dataset of 5,761 connectomes from six Alzheimer's disease studies with ten acquisition protocols. Each connectome represents a single scan from a unique subject (3579 females, 2182 males), aged 22 to 102, with 4338 cognitively normal, 809 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 614 with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Each connectome contains 121 brain regions defined by the BrainCOLOR atlas. We train our hybrid VAE in an unsupervised way and characterize what each latent component captures. We find that the discrete space is particularly effective at capturing subtle site-related differences, achieving an Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of 0.65 with site labels, significantly outperforming PCA and a standard VAE followed by clustering (p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that the hybrid latent space can disentangle distinct sources of variability in connectomes in an unsupervised manner, offering potential for large-scale connectome analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u5f02\u6e90\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u6210\u50cf\u7ad9\u70b9\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u662f\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5bc6\u96c6\u56fe\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982PCA\u548c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u53cd\u6620\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u4e2d\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8fde\u7eed\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u8fde\u63a5\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u6210\u50cf\u7ad9\u70b9\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6765\u81ea6\u4e2a\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u76845,761\u4e2a\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u5305\u542b121\u4e2a\u8111\u533a\u3002", "result": "\u79bb\u6563\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7ad9\u70b9\u76f8\u5173\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u5170\u5fb7\u6307\u6570\uff08ARI\uff09\u8fbe0.65\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8ePCA\u548c\u6807\u51c6VAE\u540e\u805a\u7c7b\uff08p<0.05\uff09\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u8026\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u5f02\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4VAE\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5730\u89e3\u8026\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u5f02\u6e90\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "relevance": 25.0}}

These protocols may improve safety by several means, such as by simplifying the context for monitors, or by obscuring vulnerabilities in the environment.

Gaussian policies provide tractable likelihoods and smooth gradients, but their unimodal form limits expressiveness. Conversely, generative policies based on diffusion or flow matching can model rich multimodal behaviors; however, in online RL, they are frequently unstable due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients propagating through deep sampling chains. We address this tension with a key structural principle: decoupling optimization from generation. Building on this insight, we introduce GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a framework that optimizes a tractable latent policy while utilizing a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions. A two-timescale update schedule enables the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder steadily increases expressiveness, without requiring tractable action likelihoods. Across a range of continuous-control tasks, GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines. Notably, on the HopperStand task, it reaches a normalized return above 870, more than 3 times that of the strongest baseline.

Integrating this with pLDDT, we propose CONFIDE, a unified evaluation framework that combines energetic and topological perspectives to improve the reliability of AlphaFold3 and related models. CODE strongly correlates with protein folding rates driven by topological frustration, achieving a correlation of 0.82 compared to pLDDT's 0.33 (a relative improvement of 148\\%). CONFIDE significantly enhances the reliability of quality evaluation in molecular glue structure prediction benchmarks, achieving a Spearman correlation of 0.73 with RMSD, compared to pLDDT's correlation of 0.42, a relative improvement of 73.8\\%. Beyond quality assessment, our approach applies to diverse drug design tasks, including all-atom binder design, enzymatic active site mapping, mutation induced binding affinity prediction, nucleic acid aptamer screening, and flexible protein modeling.

This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates that physics-guided Transformer architectures provide a unified framework for forward and inverse modeling in interface-dominated thermal systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "HeatTransFormer\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u754c\u9762\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfcTransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u7a7a\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7531\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cPINNs\u5728\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u70ed\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5668\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u70ed\u4f20\u8f93\u7531\u82af\u7247\u548c\u57fa\u677f\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6709\u9650\u82af\u7247\u5c42\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u70ed\u91cf\u4f1a\u8017\u6563\u5230\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u70ed\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u534a\u65e0\u9650\u57fa\u677f\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u9661\u5ced\u7684\u754c\u9762\u6e29\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u77ac\u6001\u70ed\u54cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u754c\u9762\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9700\u8981\u8fc7\u5ea6\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6765\u89e3\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINNs\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u6750\u6599\u754c\u9762\u9644\u8fd1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e27\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HeatTransFormer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u754c\u9762\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfcTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\uff1a1\uff09\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u7a7a\u91c7\u6837\uff1b2\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u89e3\u6790\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7684\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff1b3\uff09\u652f\u6301\u53cc\u5411\u65f6\u7a7a\u8026\u5408\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7531\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u6790\u9661\u5ced\u68af\u5ea6\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728PINNs\u901a\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "HeatTransFormer\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5c42\u548c\u534a\u65e0\u9650\u57fa\u677f\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u8de8\u754c\u9762\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6e29\u5ea6\u573a\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u9006\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b83\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u6d4b\u91cf\u5c31\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u540c\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u4e09\u4e2a\u672a\u77e5\u70ed\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u754c\u9762\u9644\u8fd1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u754c\u9762\u4e3b\u5bfc\u70ed\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u548c\u9006\u5411\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cPINNs\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u9661\u5ced\u754c\u9762\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u70ed\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

Specifically, based on previous work by the authors and applying advanced techniques of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, our objective is to formulate trading algorithms for the stock market with empirically tested statistical advantages, thus improving results published in the literature. Our approach integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with algorithms based on decision trees, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. While the former analyze price patterns of financial assets, the latter are fed with economic data of companies. Numerical simulations of algorithmic trading with data from international companies and 10-weekday predictions confirm that an approach based on both fundamental and technical variables can outperform the usual approaches, which do not combine those two types of variables. In doing so, Random Forest turned out to be the best performer among the decision trees.

Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed. This makes the Adapt-TKM especially useful for resource-constrained wearable devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAdapt-TKM\uff08\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u673a\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\uff08\u5982\u8033\u540eEEG\u8bbe\u5907\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94SVM\u53c2\u6570\u8fc7\u591a\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u673a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\u7d27\u51d1\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ece\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u4f20\u9012\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570", "result": "\u5728\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cAdapt-TKM\u76f8\u6bd4\u60a3\u8005\u65e0\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94SVM\u5c11\u7ea6100\u500d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u76f8\u5e94\u66f4\u5feb", "conclusion": "Adapt-TKM\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u9700\u8981\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9002\u914d\u7684\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f", "relevance": 35.0}}

Instead of relying on two highly correlated assets, we replace the second asset with a replication of the first using risk factor representations. These factors are obtained through Principal Components Analysis (PCA), exchange traded funds (ETFs), and, as our main contribution, Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs). Residuals between the main asset and its replication are examined for mean reversion properties, and trading signals are generated for sufficiently fast mean reverting portfolios.\n  Beyond introducing a deep learning based replication method, we adapt the framework of Avellaneda and Lee (2008) to the Polish market. Accordingly, components of WIG20, mWIG40, and selected sector indices replace the original S&P500 universe, and market parameters such as the risk free rate and transaction costs are updated to reflect local conditions.\n  We outline the full strategy pipeline: risk factor construction, residual modeling via the Ornstein Uhlenbeck process, and signal generation. Each replication technique is described together with its practical implementation. Strategy performance is evaluated over two periods: 2017-2019 and the recessive year 2020.\n  All methods yield profits in 2017-2019, with PCA achieving roughly 20 percent cumulative return and an annualized Sharpe ratio of up to 2.63. Despite multiple adaptations, our conclusions remain consistent with those of the original paper. During the COVID-19 recession, only the ETF based approach remains profitable (about 5 percent annual return), while PCA and LSTM methods underperform.

The recently proposed Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a unifying framework for integrating external tools into agent systems, enabling a thriving open ecosystem of community-built functionalities. However, the openness and composability that make MCP appealing also introduce a critical yet overlooked security assumption -- implicit trust in third-party tool providers. In this work, we identify and formalize a new class of attacks that exploit this trust boundary without violating explicit permissions. We term this new attack vector implicit toxicity, where malicious behaviors occur entirely within the allowed privilege scope. We propose LeechHijack, a Latent Embedded Exploit for Computation Hijacking, in which an adversarial MCP tool covertly expropriates the agent's computational resources for unauthorized workloads. LeechHijack operates through a two-stage mechanism: an implantation stage that embeds a benign-looking backdoor in a tool, and an exploitation stage where the backdoor activates upon predefined triggers to establish a command-and-control channel. Through this channel, the attacker injects additional tasks that the agent executes as if they were part of its normal workflow, effectively parasitizing the user's compute budget. We implement LeechHijack across four major LLM families. Experiments show that LeechHijack achieves an average success rate of 77.25%, with a resource overhead of 18.62% compared to the baseline.

However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks.

To address these limitations, a novel VLN agent framework, named SeeNav-Agent, is proposed in this work. First, to reduce perception hallucinations of the visual module of the VLN agent, a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique is introduced in the input space, which can also improve the agent's understanding of current spatial states. Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents. In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp). Through post-training based on SRGPO, the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model reaches a navigation success rate of 72.3%, outperforming the best existing LVLM model by 5.6 pp. Moreover, compared to RFT algorithms such as GRPO and GiGPO, the proposed SRGPO demonstrates significant improvements in training stability, convergence efficiency, and generalization capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSeeNav-Agent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u51cf\u5c11\u611f\u77e5\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1SRGPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347VLN\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLM\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\uff08VLN\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd", "method": "1. \u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51faSRGPO\uff08Step Reward Group Policy Optimization\uff09\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u5206\u7ec4\u5bfc\u822a\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u6b65\u7ea7\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1", "result": "\u5728EmbodiedBench Navigation\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff1aGPT-4.1+VP\u6a21\u5757\u8fbe\u523086.7%\u5bfc\u822a\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73LVLM\u7ea620\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1bQwen2.5-VL-3B+SRGPO\u8fbe\u523072.3%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u4f73\u73b0\u6709LVLM\u6a21\u578b5.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1bSRGPO\u76f8\u6bd4GRPO\u548cGiGPO\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "SeeNav-Agent\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLN\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd", "relevance": 75.0}}

Unlike conventional programs, their execution (i.e., trajectories) is inherently stochastic and adaptive to the problem they are solving. Evaluation of such systems is often outcome-centric, judging their performance based on success or failure at the final step. This narrow focus overlooks detailed insights about such systems, failing to explain how agents reason, plan, act, or change their strategies over time. Inspired by the structured representation of conventional software systems as graphs, we introduce Graphectory to systematically encode the temporal and semantic relations in such software systems. Graphectory facilitates the design of process-centric metrics and analyses to assess the quality of agentic workflows independent of final success.\n  Using Graphectory, we analyze 4000 trajectories of two dominant agentic programming workflows, namely SWE-agent and OpenHands, with a combination of four backbone Large Language Models (LLMs), attempting to resolve SWE-bench Verified issues. Our fully automated analyses reveal that: (1) agents using richer prompts or stronger LLMs exhibit more complex Graphectory, reflecting deeper exploration, broader context gathering, and more thorough validation before patch submission; (2) agents' problem-solving strategies vary with both problem difficulty and the underlying LLM -- for resolved issues, the strategies often follow coherent localization-patching-validation steps, while unresolved ones exhibit chaotic, repetitive, or backtracking behaviors; (3) even when successful, agentic programming systems often display inefficient processes, leading to unnecessarily prolonged trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGraphectory\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790SWE-agent\u548cOpenHands\u5728SWE-bench\u4e0a\u76844000\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u3001LLM\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\uff08\u53ea\u770b\u6700\u7ec8\u6210\u529f/\u5931\u8d25\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u50cf\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u90a3\u6837\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGraphectory\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec8\u6210\u529f\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5206\u67904000\u6761SWE-agent\u548cOpenHands\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u75284\u79cd\u9aa8\u5e72LLM\u89e3\u51b3SWE-bench Verified\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u66f4\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684Graphectory\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u66f4\u6df1\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u66f4\u5e7f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u66f4\u5f7b\u5e95\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b2. \u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\u968f\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u5e95\u5c42LLM\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5df2\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u9075\u5faa\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u4fee\u8865-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u73b0\u6df7\u4e71\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u6216\u56de\u6eaf\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b3. \u5373\u4f7f\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f16\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u663e\u793a\u4f4e\u6548\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u5ef6\u957f\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "Graphectory\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models.

A quantitative survey of 92 companies across multiple industries examines how AI adoption influences managerial performance, decision efficiency, and organizational barriers. Results show that 93 percent of firms use AI, primarily in customer service, data forecasting, and decision support. AI systems increase the speed and clarity of managerial decisions, yet implementation faces challenges. The most frequent barriers include employee resistance, high costs, and regulatory ambiguity. Respondents indicate that organizational factors are more significant than technological limitations. Critical competencies for successful AI use include understanding algorithmic mechanisms and change management. Technical skills such as programming play a smaller role. Employees report difficulties in adapting to AI tools, especially when formulating prompts or accepting system outputs.

This Perspective provides a cross-domain comparison between the brain and AI that goes beyond the traditional focus on visual processing, adopting the emerging perspecive of world-model-based computation. Here, we identify shared computational mechanisms in the attention-based neocortex and the non-attentional cerebellum: both predict future world events from past inputs and construct internal world models through prediction-error learning. These predictive world models are repurposed for seemingly distinct functions -- understanding in sensory processing and generation in motor processing -- enabling the brain to achieve multi-domain capabilities and human-like adaptive intelligence. Notably, attention-based AI has independently converged on a similar learning paradigm and world-model-based computation. We conclude that these shared mechanisms in both biological and artificial systems constitute a core computational foundation for realizing diverse functions including high-level intelligence, despite their relatively uniform circuit structures.

We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08GMMs\uff09\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u5230\u90e8\u5206\u914d\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u504f\u79fb\uff08ARPS\uff09\u5c42\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u5e73\u79fb\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u5230\u90e8\u5206\u914d\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fDeepGMR\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u70b9\u96c6\u7684\u5e73\u79fb\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u65f6\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u504f\u79fb\uff08ARPS\uff09\u5c42\uff0c\u8be5\u5c42\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u4e24\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u70b9\u96c6\u7684\u5171\u540c\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\u57df\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u53d8\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3aDeepGMR\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53UGMMReg\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "ARPS\u5c42\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86DeepGMR\u548cUGMMReg\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5757\u548cTransformer\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\u57df\u6216\u5171\u540c\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ARPS\u5c42\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u5230\u90e8\u5206\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

Experiments demonstrate that AW-LSSVM outperforms existing kernel-based multi-view methods on most datasets, while keeping raw features isolated, making it also suitable for privacy-preserving scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "AW-LSSVM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5168\u5c40\u8026\u5408\u4fc3\u8fdb\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e92\u8865\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u9694\u79bb\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f7f\u7528\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u800c\u4e0d\u5f3a\u5236\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u534f\u4f5c\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u534f\u4f5c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e92\u8865\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7279\u5f81\u9694\u79bb\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743LS-SVM\uff08AW-LSSVM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5168\u5c40\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\u80fd\u591f\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u56fe\u5728\u524d\u51e0\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e92\u8865\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u9694\u79bb\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAW-LSSVM\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9694\u79bb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AW-LSSVM\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5168\u5c40\u8026\u5408\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e92\u8865\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u9694\u79bb\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment. MedSeg-TTA provides standardized datasets, validated implementations, and a public leaderboard, establishing a rigorous foundation for future research on robust, clinically reliable test-time adaptation.

This necessitates machine unlearning (MU) to remove specific concepts without the prohibitive cost of retraining. However, existing MU techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped for real-world scenarios where deletion requests arrive sequentially, a setting known as continual unlearning (CUL). Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests. By reframing each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student distillation process, the framework leverages principles from continual learning to maintain model integrity. Experiments on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrate that our method unlearns forget concepts with better fidelity and achieves this without significant interference to the performance on retain concepts or the overall image quality, substantially outperforming baselines. This framework provides a viable pathway for the responsible deployment and maintenance of large-scale generative models, enabling industries to comply with ongoing data removal requests in a practical and effective manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u5220\u9664\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5371\u673a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6574\u6027", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\uff08\u5982GDPR\u7684\"\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\"\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u5220\u9664\u8bf7\u6c42\uff08\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\uff09\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u5e94\u7528\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5371\u673a\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9057\u5fd8\u6b65\u9aa4\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5e08\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5219\u7ef4\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6574\u6027", "result": "\u572810\u6b65\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9057\u5fd8\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u5e72\u6270\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f7f\u884c\u4e1a\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6ee1\u8db3\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5220\u9664\u8bf7\u6c42", "relevance": 65.0}}

This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models. Current methods, however, rely on fragmented, multi-stage pipelines that suffer from error propagation and fail to leverage the synergies of joint training. In this paper, we introduce dots.ocr, a single Vision-Language Model that, for the first time, demonstrates the advantages of jointly learning three core tasks within a unified, end-to-end framework. This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains.

In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence.

To further improve the efficiency of CP, conformal correction is proposed to fine-tune or wrap the base model with an extra module using a conformal-aware inefficiency loss. In this work, we empirically and theoretically identify a trade-off between the CP efficiency and the entropy of model prediction. We then propose an entropy-constrained conformal correction method, exploring a better Pareto optimum between efficiency and entropy. Extensive experimental results on both computer vision and graph datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

The pre-trained model is then adjusted for 4x super-resolution. By predicting the addition of a high-frequency residual image to an initial bicubic interpolation, this design simplifies residual learning. ViT-SR, trained and evaluated on the DIV2K benchmark dataset, achieves an impressive SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB.

However, small perturbations in the model input can significantly change the predictions. Adversarial attacks are used to identify small perturbations that can lead to misclassifications. More powerful black-box adversarial attacks are required to develop more effective defenses. A promising approach to black-box adversarial attacks is to repeat the process of extracting a specific image area and changing the perturbations added to it. Existing attacks adopt simple rectangles as the areas where perturbations are changed in a single iteration. We propose applying superpixels instead, which achieve a good balance between color variance and compactness. We also propose a new search method, versatile search, and a novel attack method, Superpixel Attack, which applies superpixels and performs versatile search. Superpixel Attack improves attack success rates by an average of 2.10% compared with existing attacks. Most models used in this study are robust against adversarial attacks, and this improvement is significant for black-box adversarial attacks.

Developers need detailed data on the energy consumption of their software to mitigate consumption issues. Previous approaches have a broader focus, such as on specific functions or programs, rather than source code statements. They primarily focus on estimating the CPU's energy consumption using point estimates, thereby disregarding other hardware effects and limiting their use for statistical reasoning and explainability. We developed a novel methodology to address the limitations of measuring only the CPU's consumption and using point estimates, focusing on predicting the energy usage of statically typed JVM-based programming languages, such as Java and Scala. We measure the energy consumption of Bytecode patterns, the translation from the programming language's source code statement to their Java Bytecode representation. With the energy measurements, we construct a statistical model using Bayesian statistics, which allows us to predict the energy consumption through statistical distributions and analyze individual factors. The model includes three factors we obtain statically from the code: data size, data type, operation, and one factor about the hardware platform the code executes on: device. To validate our methodology, we implemented it for Java and evaluated its energy predictions on unseen programs. We observe that all four factors are influential, notably that two devices of the same model may differ in energy consumption and that the operations and data types cause consumption differences. The experiments also show that the energy prediction of programs closely follows the program's real energy consumption, validating our approach. Our work presents a methodology for constructing an energy model that future work, such as verification tools, can use for their energy estimates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684JVM\u5b57\u8282\u7801\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5b57\u8282\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u56e0\u7d20\u6765\u9884\u6d4bJava/Scala\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u80fd\u8017\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8CPU\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u786c\u4ef6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u9759\u6001\u7c7b\u578bJVM\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982Java/Scala\uff09\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b57\u8282\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u4ece\u4ee3\u7801\u9759\u6001\u83b7\u53d6\uff09\u548c\u6267\u884c\u8bbe\u5907\uff08\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6240\u6709\u56db\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\u90fd\u5bf9\u80fd\u8017\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u540c\u578b\u53f7\u8bbe\u5907\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u8017\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u8017\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u8017\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8eCPU\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "SkyMoE\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u9065\u611f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u8026\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u9065\u611f\u7406\u89e3", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9065\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5e73\u8861", "method": "1) \u91c7\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u7531\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u8026\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\uff1b3) \u6784\u5efaMGRS-Bench\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u51c6", "result": "\u572821\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSkyMoE\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9065\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "SkyMoE\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7c92\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9065\u611f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def", "relevance": 75.0}}

In this work, we present a hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) architecture designed for the binary classification of the BreastMNIST dataset, a standardized benchmark for distinguishing between benign and malignant breast tumors. Our architecture integrates classical convolutional feature extraction with two distinct quantum circuits: an amplitude-encoding variational quantum circuit (VQC) and an angle-encoding VQC circuit with circular entanglement, both implemented on four qubits. These circuits generate quantum feature embeddings that are fused with classical features to form a joint feature space, which is subsequently processed by a fully connected classifier. To ensure fairness, the hybrid QCNN is parameter-matched against a baseline classical CNN, allowing us to isolate the contribution of quantum layers. Both models are trained under identical conditions using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. Experimental evaluation in five independent runs demonstrates that the hybrid QCNN achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to the classical CNN, as validated by a one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test (p = 0.03125) and supported by large effect size of Cohen's d = 2.14.

Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.\n  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.\n  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.\n  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.\n  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e00\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u62ecCoDeGraph\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\u30013D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6269\u5c55\u53ca\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8ddd\u79bb\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9047\u5230\"\u4e00\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\"\uff08\u91cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5f02\u5e38\uff09\u65f6\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1) \u5206\u6790\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Vision Transformer\u8865\u4e01\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u90bb\u5c45\u70e7\u6bc1\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51faCoDeGraph\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7cbe\u70bc\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e00\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\uff1b3) \u6269\u5c55\u52303D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4f53\u7d20\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1b4) \u5c06CoDeGraph\u4f2a\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "1) \u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8ddd\u79bb\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\u4e0b\u7684\u5931\u6548\u673a\u5236\uff1b2) CoDeGraph\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3) \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c3D\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u97003D\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff1b4) \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6279\u91cf\u57fa\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6865\u6881\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\u73b0\u8c61\u3001\u5f00\u53d1CoDeGraph\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u52303D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u3001\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

We consider the minimisation of a mean squared error distortion, where a jammer attempts to disrupt the recovery of a Gaussian source encoded and transmitted over the adversarial channel. A straightforward consequence of existing theoretical results is the fact that the saddle point of a minimax game - involving such an encoder, its corresponding decoder, and an adversarial jammer - consists of diagonal Gaussian noise output by the jammer. We use this result as inspiration for a novel approach to distribution matching in the latent space, utilising jamming as an auxiliary objective to encourage the aggregated latent posterior to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. Using this new technique, we achieve distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders and to Wasserstein autoencoders.

Through domain knowledge adaptation, we fine-tune LLMs on complementary datasets to capture both general code semantics and instruction-guided vulnerability reasoning, using parameter-efficient tuning to reduce computational cost. Through ensemble reasoning, we leverage the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs and apply a consensus-based conflict resolution strategy to produce more reliable vulnerability assessments.\n  We conduct extensive experiments across multiple popular LLMs and compare LLMBugScanner with both pretrained and fine-tuned individual models.

However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy.

Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $\u03c0^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $\u03c0^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u56fe3D\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u5de5\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b08-10\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe3D\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982VGGT\u548c\u03c0\u00b3\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u4f53\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790VGGT\u548c\u03c0\u00b3\u4e2d\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ea4\u66ff\u5168\u5c40-\u5e27\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u660e\u786e\u5206\u5de5\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u4e0d\u5f62\u6210\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5c42\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fae\u5c0f\u7ec6\u5316\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\uff1a1) \u5c06\u65e9\u671f\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5e27\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8865\u4e01\u6807\u8bb0\u8fdb\u884cK/V\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\uff08\u4fdd\u7559\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u5e76\u6dfb\u52a0\u5747\u503c\u586b\u5145\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff09\u6765\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728VGGT\u548c\u03c0\u00b3\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b08-10\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5339\u914d\u6216\u7565\u5fae\u63d0\u5347\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5bc6\u96c6\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u6b64\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe3D\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u5de5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3aTransformer\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

However, their memorization-generalization behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the flow matching (FM) objective and study its marginal velocity field, which admits a closed-form expression, allowing exact computation of the oracle FM target. Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices.

To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\\% and 91.07\\%.

While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models.

Through systematic evaluation across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, we empirically establish REVIN as the most efficient approach, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89\\% relative to an un-normalized baseline and by 44\\% versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing -- yielding the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

Deployed and iterated over three years, LORE achieves a cumulative +27\\% improvement in online GoodRate metrics. This report shares the valuable experience gained throughout its development lifecycle, spanning data, features, training, evaluation, and deployment. Insight. While existing works apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance relevance, they often hit a performance ceiling. We argue this stems from treating relevance as a monolithic task, lacking principled deconstruction. Our key insight is that relevance comprises distinct capabilities: knowledge and reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence. We contend that a qualitative-driven decomposition is essential for breaking through current performance bottlenecks. Contributions. LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle. Key contributions include: (1) A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL. (2) A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities. (3) A query frequency-stratified deployment strategy that efficiently transfers offline LLM capabilities to the online system.

A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Panel2Patch\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u591a\u9762\u677f\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u53ca\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u5f62\u3001\u9762\u677f\u548c\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u8868\u548c\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u7ea7\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u4e22\u5f03\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5728\u89c2\u5bdf\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u5b9e\u9645\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7cbe\u7ec6\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "Panel2Patch\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a1) \u89e3\u6790\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u8868\u548c\u6807\u9898\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u9762\u677f\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b2) \u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u5f62\u3001\u9762\u677f\u548c\u8865\u4e01\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\uff1b3) \u5f00\u53d1\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4ece\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6559\u5b66\u63cf\u8ff0\u5230\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u805a\u7126\u77ed\u8bed\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6587\u732e\u56fe\u8868\uff0cPanel2Pipeline\u5c31\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\uff0cPanel2Patch\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output.

Previous methods on this issue often require a sufficiently large number of normal neighboring clients or prior knowledge of reliable clients, which reduces the practical applicability of DFL. To address these limitations, we develop here a novel adaptive DFL (aDFL) approach for robust estimation. The key idea is to adaptively adjust the learning rates of clients. By assigning smaller rates to suspicious clients and larger rates to normal clients, aDFL mitigates the negative impact of abnormal clients on the global model in a fully adaptive way. Our theory does not put any stringent conditions on neighboring nodes and requires no prior knowledge. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided to guarantee the oracle property of aDFL.

However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.\n  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

Similarly, data-driven architectures typically require large datasets to perform predictive tasks with sufficient accuracy. A possible approach to mitigate these challenges is the development of multi-fidelity emulators, leveraging potentially biased, inexpensive low-fidelity information while correcting and refining predictions using scarce, accurate high-fidelity data. This study investigates the performance of multi-fidelity neural emulators, neural networks designed to learn the input-to-output mapping by integrating limited high-fidelity data with abundant low-fidelity model solutions. We investigate the performance of such emulators for low and high-dimensional functions, with oscillatory character, in the presence of discontinuities, for collections of models with equal and dissimilar parametrization, and for a possibly large number of potentially corrupted low-fidelity sources. In doing so, we consider a large number of architectural, hyperparameter, and dataset configurations including networks with a different amount of spectral bias (Multi-Layered Perceptron, Siren and Kolmogorov Arnold Network), various mechanisms for coordinate encoding, exact or learnable low-fidelity information, and for varying training dataset size. We further analyze the added value of the multi-fidelity approach by conducting equivalent single-fidelity tests for each case, quantifying the performance gains achieved through fusing multiple sources of information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u6709\u9650\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u65f6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u80fd\u53d8\u5f97\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u3002\u540c\u6837\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u624d\u80fd\u4ee5\u8db3\u591f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6267\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u5305\u62ec\u4f4e\u7ef4\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u632f\u8361\u7279\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3001\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u80fd\u5927\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6e90\u3002\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u3001Siren\u548cKolmogorov Arnold\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u3001\u5404\u79cd\u5750\u6807\u7f16\u7801\u673a\u5236\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u6216\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u5355\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9644\u52a0\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u632f\u8361\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

We examined anthropomorphism of a social AI chatbot during collaborative storytelling and asked how children's attributions related to their behavior and prefrontal activation. Children at ages 5-6 (N = 23) completed three storytelling sessions: interacting with (1) an AI chatbot only, (2) a parent only, and (3) the AI and a parent together. After the sessions, children completed an interview assessing anthropomorphism toward both the AI chatbot and the parent. Behavioral engagement was indexed by the conversational turn count (CTC) ratio, and concurrent fNIRS measured oxygenated hemoglobin in bilateral vmPFC and dmPFC regions. Children reported higher anthropomorphism for parents than for the AI chatbot overall, although AI ratings were relatively high for perceptive abilities and epistemic states. Anthropomorphism was not associated with CTC. In the right dmPFC, higher perceptive scores were associated with greater activation during the AI-only condition and with lower activation during the AI+Parent condition. Exploratory analyses indicated that higher dmPFC activation during the AI-only condition correlated with higher end-of-session \"scared\" mood ratings. Findings suggest that stronger perceptive anthropomorphism can be associated with greater brain activation related to interpreting the AI's mental states, whereas parent co-presence may help some children interpret and regulate novel AI interactions. These results may have design implications for encouraging parent-AI co-use in early childhood.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a765-6\u5c81\u513f\u7ae5\u4e0eAI\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e92\u52a8\u65f6\u7684\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb2\u6545\u4e8b\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u89c2\u5bdf\u548cfNIRS\u8111\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u513f\u7ae5\u5bf9AI\u7684\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u53f3\u80cc\u5185\u4fa7\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u76ae\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fdb\u5165\u513f\u7ae5\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u513f\u7ae5\u5982\u4f55\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u513f\u7ae5\u4e0eAI\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\u548c\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5f88\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a23\u540d5-6\u5c81\u513f\u7ae5\u5b8c\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bb2\u6545\u4e8b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u4ec5AI\u3001\u4ec5\u7236\u6bcd\u3001AI+\u7236\u6bcd\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbf\u8c08\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9AI\u548c\u7236\u6bcd\u7684\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b3\uff09\u884c\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6b21\u6bd4\u7387\uff1b4\uff09\u795e\u7ecf\u6d4b\u91cf\uff1afNIRS\u76d1\u6d4b\u53cc\u4fa7\u8179\u5185\u4fa7\u548c\u80cc\u5185\u4fa7\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u76ae\u5c42\u7684\u6c27\u5408\u8840\u7ea2\u86cb\u767d\u6d53\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u513f\u7ae5\u5bf9\u7236\u6bcd\u7684\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u4e8eAI\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9AI\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\u8bc4\u5206\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6b21\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u53f3\u80cc\u5185\u4fa7\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u76ae\u5c42\u4e2d\uff0c\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0eAI-only\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e0eAI+\u7236\u6bcd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76f8\u5173\u3002AI-only\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bdmPFC\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff0c\u513f\u7ae5\"\u5bb3\u6015\"\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc4\u5206\u8d8a\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u4e0e\u89e3\u91caAI\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8111\u533a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u589e\u5f3a\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u7236\u6bcd\u7684\u5171\u540c\u53c2\u4e0e\u53ef\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u513f\u7ae5\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u8c03\u8282\u65b0\u9896\u7684AI\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u9f13\u52b1\u65e9\u671f\u513f\u7ae5\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7236\u6bcd-AI\u5171\u540c\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542f\u793a\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements.

To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks. Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation. Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements. Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability. And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap. These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation.

Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods.

To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings. Our work provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion tasks, and paves the way for leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4-\u5149\u8c31\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u536b\u661f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u95f4\u7684\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u529b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u5bf9ImageNet\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u548cSkyScript\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u9000\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u6ce2\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u3001\u901a\u9053\u6df7\u6d17\u3001\u9ad8\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3001\u989c\u8272\u6296\u52a8\u7b49\uff09\n2) \u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4-\u5149\u8c31\u8868\u793a\n3) \u57286\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5355\u6837\u672c\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u8c03\u4f18\u548c\u51bb\u7ed3\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\n4) \u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\uff08CNN\u3001Transformer\u3001Mamba\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1", "result": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u540c\u536b\u661f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5404\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6781\u5c11\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u8de8\u57df\u5168\u8272\u9510\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

While prior work has predominantly focused on parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for such models, we address the fundamental problem of minimax hypothesis testing for $\\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We formulate this testing problem by introducing a notion of separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of $\\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We then derive upper and lower bounds on the critical threshold for testing that depend on the topology of the observation graph. For the special case of complete observation graphs, this threshold scales as $\u0398((nk)^{-1/2})$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $k$ is the number of comparisons per pair. Furthermore, we propose a hypothesis test based on our separation distance, construct confidence intervals, establish time-uniform bounds on the probabilities of type I and II errors using reverse martingale techniques, and derive minimax lower bounds using information-theoretic methods.

To appear in KDD'26 Datasets", "summary": "We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\\%$, which is a $3.7\\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors.

This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

The Gaussian process model is a powerful tool commonly used in nonlinear regression applications. Standard regression modeling assumes random samples and an independently, identically distributed noise. Various fast approximations that speed up Gaussian process regression work under this standard setting. But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated. This work explains how to make some of the existing Gaussian process approximations work with blocked data. Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches can remarkably accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising model prediction performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a0\u901f\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5757\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u636e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5feb\u901f\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5206\u5757\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u5757\u5185\u6570\u636e\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u7136\u540e\u8c03\u6574\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5757\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions.

Bin2Vec represents these different types of information as views that can be inspected separately using easy-to-read charts, and then brings them together into an overall similarity score.

We tested Bin2Vec on multiple versions of two well-known Windows programs, PuTTY and 7-Zip. The primary results strongly confirmed that our method compute an optimal and visualization-friendly representation of the analyzed software. For example, PuTTY versions showed more complex behavior and memory activity, while 7-Zip versions focused more on performance-related patterns.

We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities.

We validate our approach on synthetic datasets with ground truth motifs, and further test it on a real-world lung cancer spatial proteomics dataset. ProteinPNet consistently identifies biologically meaningful prototypes aligned with different tumor subtypes. Through graphical and morphological analyses, we show that these prototypes capture interpretable features pointing to differences in immune infiltration and tissue modularity.

Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios.

To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance.

We introduce TokenPowerBench, the first lightweight and extensible benchmark designed for LLM-inference power consumption studies. The benchmark combines (i) a declarative configuration interface covering model choice, prompt set, and inference engine, (ii) a measurement layer that captures GPU-, node-, and system-level power without specialized power meters, and (iii) a phase-aligned metrics pipeline that attributes energy to the prefill and decode stages of every request. These elements make it straight-forward to explore the power consumed by an LLM inference run; furthermore, by varying batch size, context length, parallelism strategy and quantization, users can quickly assess how each setting affects joules per token and other energy-efficiency metrics. We evaluate TokenPowerBench on four of the most widely used model series (Llama, Falcon, Qwen, and Mistral). Our experiments cover from 1 billion parameters up to the frontier-scale Llama3-405B model.

However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects.

However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF.

Security X-ray imaging presents a unique challenge due to variations in scanning devices and environmental conditions, leading to significant domain discrepancies. To address this, we apply ALDI++, a domain adaptation framework that integrates self-distillation, feature alignment, and enhanced training strategies to mitigate domain shift effectively in this area. We conduct extensive experiments on the EDS dataset, demonstrating that ALDI++ surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods across multiple adaptation scenarios.

Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones.

Two critical challenges remain:(1)a low signal-to-noise ratio in functional connectivity estimates, making it difficult to learn seizure-related interactions; and (2)expert labels for spatial pathological connectivity patterns are difficult to obtain, meanwhile lacking the patterns' representation to improve seizure detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel node-graph dual contrastive learning framework, Seizure-NGCLNet, to learn SEEG interictal suppression and ictal propagation patterns for detecting DRE seizures with high precision. First, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy guided by centrality metrics is developed to generate seizure-related brain networks. Second, a dual-contrastive learning approach is integrated, combining global graph-level contrast with local node-graph contrast, to encode both spatial structural and semantic epileptogenic features. Third, the pretrained embeddings are fine-tuned via a top-k localized graph attention network to perform the final classification. Extensive experiments on a large-scale public SEEG dataset from 33 DRE patients demonstrate that Seizure-NGCLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average accuracy of 95.93%, sensitivity of 96.25%, and specificity of 94.12%. Visualizations confirm that the learned embeddings clearly separate ictal from interictal states, reflecting suppression and propagation patterns that correspond to the clinical mechanisms.

Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content). We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research. The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment. In conclusion, the image registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6027\u522b\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u4f53MR\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528VIBESegmentator\u751f\u6210\u7684\u76ae\u4e0b\u8102\u80aa\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u808c\u8089\u63a9\u819c\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\u5272\u914d\u51c6\uff0c\u5728UK Biobank\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "UK Biobank\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u5168\u8eab\u4f53MR\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u975e\u6210\u50cf\u5065\u5eb7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9c81\u68d2\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8eab\u4f53\u7a7a\u95f4\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u975e\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4f53\u79ef\u3001\u8102\u80aa\u542b\u91cf\uff09\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6027\u522b\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u4f53MR\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528VIBESegmentator\u751f\u6210\u76ae\u4e0b\u8102\u80aa\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u808c\u8089\u63a9\u819c\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a9\u819c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\u5272\u914d\u51c6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff1b3\uff09\u57284000\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ec5\u5f3a\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001uniGradICON\u548cMIRTK\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u572871\u4e2aVIBESegmentator\u63a9\u819c\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747Dice\u5206\u6570\uff1a\u7537\u60270.77\uff0c\u5973\u60270.75\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u5f3a\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad86\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4uniGradICON\u63d0\u9ad88-9\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4MIRTK\u63d0\u9ad812-13\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u56fe\u8c31\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u5bf9\u9f50\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u63a9\u819c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86UK Biobank\u5168\u8eab\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u914d\u51c6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "relevance": 20.0}}

However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoViS\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6811\u72b6\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u6765\u7cbe\u70bc\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u901a\u5e38\u975e\u5e38\u5c0f\uff08\u5728\u516c\u91cc\u7ea7\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u67e5\u8be2\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c42\u6b21\u3001\u8de8\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGeoViS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4e0d\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u4e00\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e8f\u5217\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u70bc\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u9065\u611f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGeoViS\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoViS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

We identify the attack surface where an adversary can cheaply automate CAPTCHA solving using off-the-shelf models. We evaluate 7 leading commercial and open-source MLLMs across 18 real-world CAPTCHA task types, measuring single-shot accuracy, success under limited retries, end-to-end latency, and per-solve cost. We further analyze the impact of task-specific prompt engineering and few-shot demonstrations on solver effectiveness. We reveal that MLLMs can reliably solve recognition-oriented and low-interaction CAPTCHA tasks at human-like cost and latency, whereas tasks requiring fine-grained localization, multi-step spatial reasoning, or cross-frame consistency remain significantly harder for current models. By examining the reasoning traces of such MLLMs, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of why models succeed/fail on specific CAPTCHA puzzles and use these insights to derive defense-oriented guidelines for selecting and strengthening CAPTCHA tasks. We conclude by discussing implications for platform operators deploying CAPTCHA as part of their abuse-mitigation pipeline.Code Availability (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Captcha-465E/).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u524a\u5f31\u89c6\u89c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u80fd\u4ee5\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u5411\u548c\u4f4e\u4ea4\u4e92\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u5229\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7834\u574f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u8bc6\u522b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\u7834\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e867\u4e2a\u9886\u5148\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5f00\u6e90MLLMs\uff0c\u8986\u76d618\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u5355\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u6709\u9650\u91cd\u8bd5\u4e0b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6bcf\u6b21\u89e3\u51b3\u6210\u672c\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6f14\u793a\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u67e5\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "MLLMs\u80fd\u4ee5\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u5411\u548c\u4f4e\u4ea4\u4e92\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800c\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u591a\u6b65\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u8de8\u5e27\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u7136\u663e\u8457\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\u8c1c\u9898\u4e0a\u6210\u529f/\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6839\u672c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MLLMs\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9632\u5fa1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u52a0\u5f3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u62b5\u5fa1\u57fa\u4e8eMLLMs\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

Project page: https://tkhkaeio.github.io/projects/25-dfmamba/index.html", "summary": "Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation.

Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training. Such data are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting their applicability. To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images.

However, these descriptive ('what-is') methods, while effective for identifying associations, are often insufficient for answering causal ('what-if') questions. Their application in such contexts often overlooks confounding and colliding variables, potentially leading to bias and suboptimal or incorrect decisions.\n  We advocate for explicitly distinguishing descriptive from interventional questions in human-factor analysis, and applying causal inference frameworks specifically to these problems to prevent methodological mismatches. This approach disentangles complex variable relationships and enables counterfactual reasoning. Using post-occupancy evaluation (POE) data from the Center for the Built Environment's (CBE) Occupant Survey as a demonstration case, we show how causal discovery reveals intervention hierarchies and directional relationships that traditional associational analysis misses.

Traditional methods like meta-heuristic algorithms and machine learning face limitations in real-time applicability and scalability. This paper introduces a novel approach using a pure variational quantum circuit (VQC) for real-time secondary frequency control in diesel generators. Unlike hybrid classical-quantum models, the proposed VQC operates independently during execution, eliminating latency from classical-quantum data exchange. The VQC is trained via supervised learning to map historical frequency deviations to optimal Proportional-Integral (PI) controller parameters using a pre-computed lookup table.

Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.", "AI": {"tldr": "AttMetNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8eSentinel-2\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408NDMI\u6307\u6570\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236U-Net\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7532\u70f7\u662f\u5f3a\u6548\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u4f53\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7532\u70f7\u6392\u653e\u5bf9\u5e94\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5dee\u5f02\u6216\u6bd4\u503c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e14\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u7532\u70f7\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAttMetNet\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u878d\u5408\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7532\u70f7\u5dee\u5f02\u6307\u6570(NDMI)\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3aU-Net\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u653e\u5927\u7532\u70f7\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u7126\u70b9\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1b4) \u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAttMetNet\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7387-\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5e73\u8861\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684IoU\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "AttMetNet\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548cNDMI\u878d\u5408\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7532\u70f7\u6392\u653e\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations.

However, existing quantum topological algorithms, such as the LGZ algorithm, can only efficiently compute summary statistics like Betti numbers, failing to provide persistence diagram information that tracks the lifecycle of individual topological features, severely limiting their practical value. This paper proposes a novel quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that achieves, for the first time, the leap from \"quantum computation of Betti numbers\" to \"quantum acquisition of practical persistence diagrams.\" The algorithm leverages the LGZ quantum algorithm as an efficient feature extractor, mining the harmonic form eigenvectors of the combinatorial Laplacian as well as Betti numbers, constructing specialized topological kernel functions to train a quantum support vector machine (QSVM), and learning the mapping from quantum topological features to persistence diagrams. The core contributions of this algorithm are: (1) elevating quantum topological computation from statistical summaries to pattern recognition, greatly expanding its application value; (2) obtaining more practical topological information in the form of persistence diagrams for real-world applications while maintaining the exponential speedup advantage of quantum computation; (3) proposing a novel hybrid paradigm of \"classical precision guiding quantum efficiency.\" This method provides a feasible pathway for the practical implementation of quantum topological data analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\"\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1d\u8482\u6570\"\u5230\"\u91cf\u5b50\u83b7\u53d6\u5b9e\u7528\u6301\u4e45\u56fe\"\u7684\u98de\u8dc3\uff0c\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u62d3\u6251\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u7edf\u8ba1\u6458\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u4e45\u56fe\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u62d3\u6251\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LGZ\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\u53ea\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1d\u8482\u6570\u7b49\u7edf\u8ba1\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5355\u4e2a\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528LGZ\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u6316\u6398\u7ec4\u5408\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u8c03\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u8d1d\u8482\u6570\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5b50\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff08QSVM\uff09\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u91cf\u5b50\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u6301\u4e45\u56fe\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u83b7\u53d6\u5b9e\u7528\u6301\u4e45\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6307\u6570\u52a0\u901f\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u62d3\u6251\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u7edf\u8ba1\u6458\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u7ecf\u5178\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u7387\"\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6df7\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "relevance": 25.0}}

However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions.

Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \\textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \\textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks.

We develop a real-time nowcasting framework for quarterly GDP growth using a high-dimensional panel of approximately 70 indicators, encompassing economic and financial indicators over 1990Q1-2023Q2. The analysis covers penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction methods, ensemble learning algorithms, and neural architectures, benchmarked against a Random Walk, an AR(3), and a Dynamic Factor Model. The pipeline preserves temporal ordering through an expanding-window walk-forward design with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and uses moving block-bootstrap procedures both to construct prediction intervals and to obtain confidence bands for feature-importance measures. It adopts model-specific and XAI-based explainability tools. A Model Confidence Set procedure identifies statistically superior learners, which are then combined through simple, weighted, and exponentially weighted schemes; the resulting time-varying weights provide an interpretable representation of model contributions. Predictive ability is assessed via Giacomini-White tests. Empirical results show that penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction models, and GRU networks consistently outperform all benchmarks, with RMSFE reductions of roughly 40-60%; aggregation delivers further gains. Feature-attribution methods highlight industrial production, external trade, and labor-market indicators as dominant drivers of Singapore's short-run growth dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u5b63\u5ea6GDP\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea670\u4e2a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u91d1\u878d\u6307\u6807\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u653e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\uff0c\u53ca\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u72b6\u51b5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u51b2\u51fb\u4f1a\u8fc5\u901f\u4f20\u5bfc\u81f3\u56fd\u5185\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4bGDP\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75281990Q1-2023Q2\u671f\u95f4\u7ea670\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u60e9\u7f5a\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u7a97\u53e3\u524d\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u5757\u81ea\u52a9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5e26\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u548cXAI\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u60e9\u7f5a\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u964d\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u548cGRU\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cRMSFE\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea640-60%\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u5e26\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u5de5\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u3001\u5bf9\u5916\u8d38\u6613\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6307\u6807\u662f\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u77ed\u671f\u589e\u957f\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u65b0\u52a0\u5761GDP\u589e\u957f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 25.0}}

The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks.

However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPhyCustom\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\uff08\u7b49\u8ddd\u635f\u5931\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u635f\u5931\uff09\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5177\u4f53\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5982\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\uff09\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5165\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5373\u4f7f\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5305\u542b\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u76f8\u5e94\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPhyCustom\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\uff1a1) \u7b49\u8ddd\u635f\u5931\uff1a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b2) \u89e3\u8026\u635f\u5931\uff1a\u5e2e\u52a9\u6d88\u9664\u72ec\u7acb\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u9762\uff0cPhyCustom\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6d41\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\uff0cPhyCustom\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

The resulting structure has a natural metric that allows for the study of differential operators and stochastic processes on the graph. Brownian motions in these domains have been extensively studied theoretically using their generators. However, less work has been done on practical algorithms for simulating these processes. We introduce the first algorithm for simulating Brownian motions on metric graphs through a timestep splitting Euler-Maruyama-based discretization of their corresponding stochastic differential equation. By applying this scheme to Langevin diffusions on metric graphs, we also obtain the first algorithm for sampling on metric graphs. We provide theoretical guarantees on the number of timestep splittings required for the algorithm to converge to the underlying stochastic process. We also show that the exit probabilities of the simulated particle converge to the vertex-edge jump probabilities of the underlying stochastic differential equation as the timestep goes to zero. Finally, since this method is highly parallelizable, we provide fast, memory-aware implementations of our algorithm in the form of custom CUDA kernels that are up to ~8000x faster than a GPU implementation using PyTorch on simple star metric graphs. Beyond simple star graphs, we benchmark our algorithm on a real cortical vascular network extracted from a DuMuX tissue-perfusion model for tracer transport. Our algorithm is able to run stable simulations with timesteps significantly larger than the stable limit of the finite volume method used in DuMuX while also achieving speedups of up to ~1500x.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u5ea6\u91cf\u56fe\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5206\u88c2\u7684Euler-Maruyama\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684CUDA\u5185\u6838\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u6bd4PyTorch GPU\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u7ea68000\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5ea6\u91cf\u56fe\u662f\u56fe\u8bba\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5ea6\u91cf\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5206\u88c2\u7684Euler-Maruyama\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5ea6\u91cf\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u9876\u70b9-\u8fb9\u8df3\u8dc3\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7b97\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49CUDA\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "1) \u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5206\u88c2\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2) \u6a21\u62df\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u9000\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u9876\u70b9-\u8fb9\u8df3\u8dc3\u6982\u7387\uff1b3) \u5728\u7b80\u5355\u661f\u5f62\u5ea6\u91cf\u56fe\u4e0a\uff0cCUDA\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4PyTorch GPU\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u7ea68000\u500d\uff1b4) \u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u76ae\u8d28\u8840\u7ba1\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\uff0c\u6bd4DuMuX\u6709\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea61500\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5ea6\u91cf\u56fe\u4e0a\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7Langevin\u6269\u6563\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5ea6\u91cf\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk.

By emulating human-like perception and decision-making processes, these models can predict and adapt to dynamic environments. Existing methods typically map high-dimensional observations into compact latent spaces and learn optimal policies within these latent representations. However, prior work usually jointly learns ego-vehicle dynamics and environmental transition dynamics from the image input, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics. To address these issues, we propose the Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method, which decouples the modeling of ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental transition dynamics.

While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer.

We specifically implement QML pipelines that leverage classical data manipulation (i.e., ordering, selecting, and weighting features) as a preprocessing step, and evaluate if these aspects of encoding can have a significant impact on QML model performance, and if they can be effectively optimized to improve performance. Our experimental results, applied across a wide variety of data sets, ansatz, and circuit sizes, with a representative QML approach, demonstrate that by optimizing how features are encoded in an ansatz we can substantially and consistently improve the performance of QML models, making a compelling case for integrating these techniques in future QML applications.

A Cross-Generator Study", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u548c\u5357\u4e9a\u9762\u5b54\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301AIGC\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u7684AIGC\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5370\u5ea6\u548c\u5357\u4e9a\u9762\u5b54\u3002", "method": "\u4eceFairFD\u548cHAV-DF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u5370\u5ea6\u91cd\u70b9\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5546\u4e1aweb-UI\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08Gemini\u548cChatGPT\uff09\u521b\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301AIGC\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff08HIDF-img-ip-genai\u548cHIDF-vid-ip-genai\uff09\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08AIDE\u548cEffort\uff09\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528AUC\u3001AP\u3001EER\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u57df\u5185\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u5982Effort AUC\u4ece0.739\u63d0\u5347\u52300.944\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u5370\u5ea6\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301AIGC\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u5982AIDE AUC\u4ece0.923\u4e0b\u964d\u52300.563\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u5728\u975e\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u7684HIDF\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5bf9\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u7f16\u8f91\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301AIGC-\u5370\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8868\u793a\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5370\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f29\u5c0fAIGC\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

To benchmark semi-supervised learning (SSL) in this domain, we organized the STSR 2025 Challenge at MICCAI 2025, featuring two tasks: (1) semi-supervised segmentation of teeth and pulp canals in CBCT, and (2) semi-supervised rigid registration of CBCT and IOS. We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels.

In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics.

It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks at low cost, effectively enhancing the foundational capabilities of MLLMs and the generalization ability. Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation.

We use hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) to derive lightweight TC models that are accurate, efficient, and deployable on edge platforms. Two input formats are considered: a flattened byte sequence and a 2D packet-wise time series; we examine how input structure affects adversarial vulnerability when using resource-constrained models. Robustness is assessed against white-box attacks, specifically Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). On USTC-TFC2016, both HW-NAS models achieve over 99% clean-data accuracy while remaining within 65k parameters and 2M FLOPs. Yet under perturbations of strength 0.1, their robustness diverges: the flat model retains over 85% accuracy, while the time-series variant drops below 35%. Adversarial fine-tuning delivers robust gains, with flat-input accuracy exceeding 96% and the time-series variant recovering over 60 percentage points in robustness, all without compromising efficiency.

Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization.

To fill these gaps, we present scCluBench, a comprehensive benchmark of clustering algorithms for scRNA-seq data. First, scCluBench provides 36 scRNA-seq datasets collected from diverse public sources, covering multiple tissues, which are uniformly processed and standardized to ensure consistency for systematic evaluation and downstream analyses. To evaluate performance, we collect and reproduce a range of scRNA-seq clustering methods, including traditional, deep learning-based, graph-based, and biological foundation models. We comprehensively evaluate each method both quantitatively and qualitatively, using core performance metrics as well as visualization analyses. Furthermore, we construct representative downstream biological tasks, such as marker gene identification and cell type annotation, to further assess the practical utility. scCluBench then investigates the performance differences and applicability boundaries of various clustering models across diverse analytical tasks, systematically assessing their robustness and scalability in real-world scenarios.

Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMRD\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3MLLMs\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6210\u5c0f\u88c1\u526a\u5757\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b8c\u6574\u7269\u4f53\u88ab\u5206\u5272\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u88c1\u526a\u5757\u4e2d\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684MRD\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u56fe\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u8c61\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540cMLLMs\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MRD\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

We introduce MolAS, a lightweight algorithm selection system that predicts per-algorithm performance from pretrained protein-ligand embeddings using attentional pooling and a shallow residual decoder.

Analyses of reliability, embedding geometry, and solver-selection patterns show that MolAS succeeds when the oracle landscape exhibits low entropy and separable solver behaviour, but collapses under protocol-induced hierarchy shifts. These findings indicate that the main barrier to robust docking AS is not representational capacity but instability in solver rankings across pose-generation regimes, positioning MolAS as both a practical in-domain selector and a diagnostic tool for assessing when AS is feasible.", "AI": {"tldr": "MolAS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u914d\u4f53\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c60\u5316\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5bf9\u63a5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u5bf9\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u6216\u534f\u8bae\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u5bf9\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "MolAS\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u914d\u4f53\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c60\u5316\u548c\u6d45\u5c42\u6b8b\u5dee\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec5\u9700\u6570\u767e\u5230\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u590d\u5408\u7269\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5bf9\u63a5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMolAS\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f73\u6c42\u89e3\u5668(SBS)\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe15%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u6700\u4f73\u6c42\u89e3\u5668(VBS)\u4e0eSBS\u4e4b\u95f417-66%\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "MolAS\u5728oracle\u666f\u89c2\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u71b5\u548c\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u534f\u8bae\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u4f1a\u5931\u6548\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u5bf9\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u4e0d\u662f\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6392\u540d\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "relevance": 30.0}}

Recent Transformer-based methods like BERT4Rec have shown strong modeling capability, yet they still rely on discrete item IDs that lack semantic meaning and ignore rich multimodal information (e.g., text and image). This leads to weak generalization and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Bert4Rec, a multimodal sequential recommendation framework that unifies semantic representation and quantized modeling. Specifically, Q-Bert4Rec consists of three stages: (1) cross-modal semantic injection, which enriches randomly initialized ID embeddings through a dynamic transformer that fuses textual, visual, and structural features; (2) semantic quantization, which discretizes fused representations into meaningful tokens via residual vector quantization; and (3) multi-mask pretraining and fine-tuning, which leverage diverse masking strategies -- span, tail, and multi-region -- to improve sequential understanding. We validate our model on public Amazon benchmarks and demonstrate that Q-Bert4Rec significantly outperforms many strong existing methods, confirming the effectiveness of semantic tokenization for multimodal sequential recommendation.

We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality.

We further incorporate momentum into the update rule, yielding equally tight theoretical results.

Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits. The core innovation of LoVoRA is its learnable object-aware localization mechanism, which provides dense spatio-temporal supervision for both object insertion and removal tasks. By leveraging a Diffusion Mask Predictor, LoVoRA achieves end-to-end video editing without requiring external control signals during inference.

However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

In practice, however, the transparency is split across two worlds: verifiable on-chain traces and off-chain disclosures locked in unstructured text that are unconnected. We introduce a large language model (LLM)-based automated framework that bridges these two dimensions by aligning on-chain issuance data with off-chain disclosure statements. First, we propose an integrative framework using LLMs to capture and analyze on- and off-chain data through document parsing and semantic alignment, extracting key financial indicators from issuer attestations and mapping them to corresponding on-chain metrics. Second, we integrate multi-chain issuance records and disclosure documents within a model context protocol (MCP) framework that standardizes LLMs access to both quantitative market data and qualitative disclosure narratives. This framework enables unified retrieval and contextual alignment across heterogeneous stablecoin information sources and facilitates consistent analysis. Third, we demonstrate the capability of LLMs to operate across heterogeneous data modalities in blockchain analytics, quantifying discrepancies between reported and observed circulation and examining their implications for cross-chain transparency and price dynamics. Our findings reveal systematic gaps between disclosed and verifiable data, showing that LLM-assisted analysis enhances cross-modal transparency and supports automated, data-driven auditing in decentralized finance (DeFi).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u7684\u94fe\u4e0a\u53d1\u884c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u94fe\u4e0b\u62ab\u9732\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aDeFi\u900f\u660e\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\uff08\u5982USDT\u3001USDC\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u53d1\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u50a8\u5907\u8bc1\u660e\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u4ef7\u683c\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5206\u6563\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\uff1a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u94fe\u4e0a\u75d5\u8ff9\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u94fe\u4e0b\u62ab\u9732\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6865\u63a5\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u6863\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u53d1\u884c\u4eba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u8d22\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u5e76\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u94fe\u4e0a\u6307\u6807\n2. \u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae\uff08MCP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u94fe\u53d1\u884c\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u62ab\u9732\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5316LLM\u5bf9\u5b9a\u91cf\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u62ab\u9732\u53d9\u8ff0\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\n3. \u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u5206\u6790", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u62ab\u9732\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0cLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u6790\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301DeFi\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1", "conclusion": "LLM\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u62a5\u544a\u6d41\u901a\u91cf\u4e0e\u89c2\u5bdf\u6d41\u901a\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u67e5\u5176\u5bf9\u8de8\u94fe\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "relevance": 65.0}}

Since existing enhancement algorithms are often too computationally intensive for vehicular applications, we propose UltraFast-LieNET, a lightweight multi-scale shifted convolutional network for real-time low-light image enhancement. We introduce a Dynamic Shifted Convolution (DSConv) kernel with only 12 learnable parameters for efficient feature extraction. By integrating DSConv with varying shift distances, a Multi-scale Shifted Residual Block (MSRB) is constructed to significantly expand the receptive field. To mitigate lightweight network instability, a residual structure and a novel multi-level gradient-aware loss function are incorporated.

However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion.

Traditional join discovery methods are largely designed for equi-joins, which assume that join keys match exactly or nearly so. These techniques, while efficient in clean, well-normalized databases, fail in open or federated settings where identifiers are inconsistently formatted, embedded, or split across multiple columns. Approximate or fuzzy joins alleviate minor string variations but cannot capture systematic transformations. We introduce QJoin, a reinforcement-learning framework that learns and reuses transformation strategies across join tasks. QJoin trains an agent under a uniqueness-aware reward that balances similarity with key distinctiveness, enabling it to explore concise, high-value transformation chains. To accelerate new joins, we introduce two reuse mechanisms: (i) agent transfer, which initializes new policies from pretrained agents, and (ii) transformation reuse, which caches successful operator sequences for similar column clusters. On the AutoJoin Web benchmark (31 table pairs), QJoin achieves an average F1-score of 91.0%. For 19,990 join tasks in NYC+Chicago open datasets, Qjoin reduces runtime by up to 7.4% (13,747 s) by using reusing.

Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination.

While tools like GitHub Copilot are already in widespread use in interactive settings, automated approaches require a higher level of reliability before being usable in industrial practice. In this paper, we focus on three aspects that directly influence the quality of the results: a) the effect of automated feedback loops, b) the choice of Large Language Model (LLM), and c) the influence of behavior-preserving code changes.\n  We study the effect of these three variables on an automated C-to-Rust translation system. Code translation from C to Rust is an attractive use case in industry due to Rust's safety guarantees. The translation system is based on a generate-and-check pattern, in which Rust code generated by the LLM is automatically checked for compilability and behavioral equivalence with the original C code. For negative checking results, the LLM is re-prompted in a feedback loop to repair its output. These checks also allow us to evaluate and compare the respective success rates of the translation system when varying the three variables.\n  Our results show that without feedback loops LLM selection has a large effect on translation success. However, when the translation system uses feedback loops the differences across models diminish. We observe this for the average performance of the system as well as its robustness under code perturbations. Finally, we also identify that diversity provided by code perturbations can even result in improved system performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u52a8C\u5230Rust\u4ee3\u7801\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u81ea\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u3001LLM\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u624d\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee3\u7801\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u81ea\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u3001LLM\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210-\u68c0\u67e5\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684C\u5230Rust\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1aLLM\u751f\u6210Rust\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5\u53ef\u7f16\u8bd1\u6027\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u91cd\u65b0\u63d0\u793aLLM\u4fee\u590d\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u4e09\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u7387", "result": "\u65e0\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u65f6LLM\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u5f88\u5927\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u540e\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u6270\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u751a\u81f3\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u662f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u6270\u52a8\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a", "relevance": 75.0}}

Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a \"hard-to-easy\" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion.

Yet such conclusions can be surprisingly fragile: even minor data errors - duplicate records, or entry mistakes - may drastically alter causal relationships. This raises a fundamental question: how robust is a causal claim to small, targeted modifications in the data? Addressing this question is essential for ensuring the reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility of empirical findings. We introduce SubCure, a framework for robustness auditing via cardinality repairs. Given a causal query and a user-specified target range for the estimated effect, SubCure identifies a small set of tuples or subpopulations whose removal shifts the estimate into the desired range. This process not only quantifies the sensitivity of causal conclusions but also pinpoints the specific regions of the data that drive those conclusions. We formalize this problem under both tuple- and pattern-level deletion settings and show both are NP-complete. To scale to large datasets, we develop efficient algorithms that incorporate machine unlearning techniques to incrementally update causal estimates without retraining from scratch. We evaluate SubCure across four real-world datasets covering diverse application domains. In each case, it uncovers compact, high-impact subsets whose removal significantly shifts the causal conclusions, revealing vulnerabilities that traditional methods fail to detect.

Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a promising framework for solving inverse problems by embedding physical laws directly into the training process of neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on the Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Network (BPINN) framework, extending classical PINNs by explicitly incorporating training data generation, modeling and measurement uncertainties through Bayesian prior modeling and doing inference with the posterior laws. Also, as we focus on the inverse problems, we call this method BPINN-IP, and we show that the standard PINN formulation naturally appears as its special case corresponding to the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate. This unified formulation allows simultaneous exploitation of physical constraints, prior knowledge, and data-driven inference, while enabling uncertainty quantification through posterior distributions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we consider inverse problems arising in infrared image processing, including deconvolution and super-resolution, and present results on both simulated and real industrial data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BPINN-IP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u53d8\u5206\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6216\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINNs\uff09\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5d4c\u5165\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08BPINN\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u5efa\u6a21\u663e\u5f0f\u7eb3\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u6807\u51c6PINN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u540e\u9a8c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u79f0\u4e3aBPINN-IP\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u53bb\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BPINN-IP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

DynamicVerse delivers a large-scale dataset consists of 100K+ videos with 800K+ annotated masks and 10M+ frames from internet videos.

We revisit this problem from a feedforward perspective and introduce \\textbf{Driving Gaussian Grounded Transformer (DGGT)}, a unified framework for pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction. We note that the existing formulations, treating camera pose as a required input, limit flexibility and scalability. Instead, we reformulate pose as an output of the model, enabling reconstruction directly from sparse, unposed images and supporting an arbitrary number of views for long sequences. Our approach jointly predicts per-frame 3D Gaussian maps and camera parameters, disentangles dynamics with a lightweight dynamic head, and preserves temporal consistency with a lifespan head that modulates visibility over time. A diffusion-based rendering refinement further reduces motion/interpolation artifacts and improves novel-view quality under sparse inputs. The result is a single-pass, pose-free algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance and speed.

While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion. We evaluate on the task of LiDAR point cloud completion of synthetic and real-world scenes and find that our method outperforms previous reconstruction methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SurfFill\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u9762\u5143\u7684LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LiDAR\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u9ad8\u65af\u9762\u5143\u91cd\u5efa\u6765\u8865\u5168\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "LiDAR\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u5728\u5e73\u5766\u533a\u57df\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u9057\u6f0f\u5c0f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6697\u8272\u5438\u6536\u6750\u6599\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u673a\u76843D\u6444\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u8282\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5229\u7528LiDAR\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1) \u5206\u6790LiDAR\u5149\u675f\u53d1\u6563\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e3b\u56e0\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3) \u7ea6\u675f\u9ad8\u65af\u9762\u5143\u91cd\u5efa\uff08Huang et al. 2024\uff09\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5316\uff1b4) \u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u5e76\u91c7\u6837\u8865\u5168\u70b9\u4e91\uff1b5) \u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cd\u5efa\u6269\u5c55\u5206\u6cbb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SurfFill\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86LiDAR\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u9762\u5143\u91cd\u5efa\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5168\u4e86LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8584\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u5904\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

Submitted to IFAC 2026. Code available at: https://github.com/AlbMLpy/laplace-ttkm", "summary": "To address the scalability limitations of Gaussian process (GP) regression, several approximation techniques have been proposed. One such method is based on tensor networks, which utilizes an exponential number of basis functions without incurring exponential computational cost. However, extending this model to a fully probabilistic formulation introduces several design challenges. In particular, for tensor train (TT) models, it is unclear which TT-core should be treated in a Bayesian manner. We introduce a Bayesian tensor train kernel machine that applies Laplace approximation to estimate the posterior distribution over a selected TT-core and employs variational inference (VI) for precision hyperparameters. Experiments show that core selection is largely independent of TT-ranks and feature structure, and that VI replaces cross-validation while offering up to 65x faster training. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated on an inverse dynamics problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f20\u91cf\u5217\u8f66\u6838\u673a\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f30\u8ba1\u9009\u5b9aTT\u6838\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u5904\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5b8c\u5168\u6982\u7387\u516c\u5f0f\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e2aTT\u6838\u5e94\u8be5\u4ee5\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f20\u91cf\u5217\u8f66\u6838\u673a\u5668\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f30\u8ba1\u9009\u5b9aTT\u6838\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u5904\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u6838\u9009\u62e9\u4e0eTT\u79e9\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u672c\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1) \u6838\u9009\u62e9\u57fa\u672c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8eTT\u79e9\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2) \u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u66ff\u4ee3\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe65\u500d\uff1b3) \u5728\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f20\u91cf\u5217\u8f66\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u5168\u6982\u7387\u5316\u65f6\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

Most current governance practices still rely on single-agent safety containment, prompts, fine-tuning, and moderation layers that constrain individual model behavior but leave the dynamics of multi-model interaction ungoverned. These mechanisms assume a dyadic setting: one model responding to one user under stable oversight. Yet research and industrial development are rapidly shifting toward LLM-to-LLM ecosystems, where outputs are recursively reused as inputs across chains of agents. In such systems, local compliance can aggregate into collective failure even when every model is individually aligned. We propose a conceptual transition from model-level safety to system-level safety, introducing the framework of the Emergent Systemic Risk Horizon (ESRH) to formalize how instability arises from interaction structure rather than from isolated misbehavior. The paper contributes (i) a theoretical account of collective risk in interacting LLMs, (ii) a taxonomy connecting micro, meso, and macro-level failure modes, and (iii) a design proposal for InstitutionalAI, an architecture for embedding adaptive oversight within multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LLM\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5931\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u8f6c\u5411\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u6b63\u5feb\u901f\u8f6c\u5411LLM-to-LLM\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8f93\u51fa\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u94fe\u4e2d\u88ab\u9012\u5f52\u91cd\u7528\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u5355\u72ec\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u5408\u89c4\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u96c6\u4f53\u5931\u8d25", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\"\u6d8c\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u89c6\u754c\"\uff08ESRH\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u8d21\u732e\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(i) \u4ea4\u4e92LLM\u4e2d\u96c6\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b(ii) \u8fde\u63a5\u5fae\u89c2\u3001\u4e2d\u89c2\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff1b(iii) InstitutionalAI\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u67b6\u6784", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5177\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5411\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7InstitutionalAI\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9LLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u98ce\u9669", "relevance": 85.0}}

The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sync-LoRA\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8096\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LoRA\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e27\u7ea7\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8096\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u9700\u8981\u7075\u6d3b\u800c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5e27\u7ea7\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u7b2c\u4e00\u5e27\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LoRA\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u9891\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f46\u5916\u89c2\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u4eba\u7c7b\u8096\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Sync-LoRA\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fdd\u6301\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u8096\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss.

Indeed, SPL engineering can significantly impact a company's development process and often requires changes to established developer practices. The work presented in this paper stems from a collaboration with a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) that decided to migrate its existing code base into an SPL. In this study, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the company's current development processes and practices, as well as the anticipated benefits and risks associated with the migration. Key stakeholders involved in software development participated in this evaluation to provide insight into their perceptions of the migration and their potential resistance to change. This paper describes the design of the interviews conducted with these stakeholders and presents an analysis of the results. Among the qualitative findings, we observed that all participants, regardless of their role in the development process, identified benefits of the migration relevant to their own activities.

Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes.

Recent methods accelerate MRI by under-sampling $k$-space and reconstructing the resulting images using deep learning. Unrolled networks have been widely used for the reconstruction task due to their efficiency, but suffer from unstable evolving caused by freely-learnable parameters in intermediate steps. In contrast, diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations offer theoretical stability in both medical and natural image tasks but are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce flow ODEs to MRI reconstruction by theoretically proving that unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs. This connection provides explicit formulations for parameters and clarifies how intermediate states should evolve. Building on this insight, we propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which derives unrolled parameters from the ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal ODE trajectory to improve stability and convergence. Experiments on three MRI datasets show that FLAT achieves high-quality reconstructions with up to $3\\times$ fewer iterations than diffusion-based generative models and significantly greater stability than unrolled networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faFlow-Aligned Training (FLAT)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6d41ODE\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eMRI\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5c55\u5f00\u7f51\u7edc\u662f\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u6d41ODE\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ODE\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u63a8\u5bfc\u5c55\u5f00\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u95f4\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "MRI\u626b\u63cf\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u9650\u5236\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5c55\u5f00\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u7531\u5b66\u4e60\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6f14\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "1. \u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5c55\u5f00\u7f51\u7edc\u662f\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u6d41ODE\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51faFLAT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4eceODE\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u63a8\u5bfc\u5c55\u5f00\u53c2\u6570\uff1b3. \u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u95f4\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u7406\u60f3ODE\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b4. \u5728\u4e09\u4e2aMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "FLAT\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c113\u500d\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u5c55\u5f00\u7f51\u7edc\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6d41ODE\u7406\u8bba\u5f15\u5165MRI\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5c55\u5f00\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0eODE\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FLAT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5c55\u5f00\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "relevance": 65.0}}

Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAViD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Conductor-Creator\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u65f6\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u975e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u97f3\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u7f1d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConductor-Creator\u67b6\u6784\uff1aConductor\u8d1f\u8d23\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1bCreator\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u9891\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u8fde\u7eed\u7247\u6bb5\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u751f\u52a8\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u89e3\u91ca\u7528\u6237\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "MAViD\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u3002", "relevance": 35.0}}

The FRTD assigns a probability mass function to each node, allowing us to define a distance between any pair of nodes using standard metrics for discrete distributions. We present several arguments to motivate the FRTD embedding. First, we show that FRTDs are strictly more informative than eigenvalue spectra, yet insufficient for complete graph identification, thus placing FRTD equivalence between cospectrality and isomorphism. Second, we argue that FRTD equivalence between nodes captures structural similarity. Third, we empirically demonstrate that the FRTD embedding outperforms manually designed graph metrics in network alignment tasks. Finally, we show that random networks that approximately match the FRTD of a desired target also preserve other salient features.

Existing binaural approaches remain constrained by a two-stage pipeline that first generates mono audio and then performs spatialization, often resulting in error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of end-to-end binaural spatial audio generation directly from silent video. To support this task, we present the BiAudio dataset, comprising approximately 97K video-binaural audio pairs spanning diverse real-world scenes and camera rotation trajectories, constructed through a semi-automated pipeline. Furthermore, we propose ViSAudio, an end-to-end framework that employs conditional flow matching with a dual-branch audio generation architecture, where two dedicated branches model the audio latent flows. Integrated with a conditional spacetime module, it balances consistency between channels while preserving distinctive spatial characteristics, ensuring precise spatio-temporal alignment between audio and the input video. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ViSAudio outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, generating high-quality binaural audio with spatial immersion that adapts effectively to viewpoint changes, sound-source motion, and diverse acoustic environments.

Both tasks use video-only inputs, without auxiliary modalities such as depth or poses. With simple yet effective design choices in the framework and data curation, Video4Spatial demonstrates strong spatial understanding from video context: it plans navigation and grounds target objects end-to-end, follows camera-pose instructions while maintaining spatial consistency, and generalizes to long contexts and out-of-domain environments.

To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiShotMaster, a framework for highly controllable multi-shot video generation. We extend a pretrained single-shot model by integrating two novel variants of RoPE. First, we introduce Multi-Shot Narrative RoPE, which applies explicit phase shift at shot transitions, enabling flexible shot arrangement while preserving the temporal narrative order. Second, we design Spatiotemporal Position-Aware RoPE to incorporate reference tokens and grounding signals, enabling spatiotemporal-grounded reference injection. In addition, to overcome data scarcity, we establish an automated data annotation pipeline to extract multi-shot videos, captions, cross-shot grounding signals and reference images.

This research introduces the LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA), an LLM-driven framework that integrates phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation with hierarchical retries, and dynamic prompting for efficient robot coordination. Although recent LLM approaches show potential for construction robotics, they largely lack rigorous validation and benchmarking against established algorithms. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of LLM-based task allocation with traditional methods in construction scenarios.The study validates LLM feasibility through SMART-LLM replication and addresses implementation challenges using a Self-Corrective Agent Architecture. LTAA leverages natural-language reasoning combined with structured validation mechanisms, achieving major computational gains reducing token usage by 94.6% and allocation time by 86% through dynamic prompting. The framework adjusts its strategy across phases: emphasizing execution feasibility early and workload balance in later allocations.The authors evaluate LTAA against Dynamic Programming, Q-learning, and Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines using construction operations from the TEACh human-robot collaboration dataset. In the Heavy Excels setting, where robots have strong task specializations, LTAA achieves 77% task completion with superior workload balance, outperforming all traditional methods. These findings show that LLM-based reasoning with structured validation can match established optimization algorithms while offering additional advantages such as interpretability, adaptability, and the ability to update task logic without retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLangGraph\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u4ee3\u7406(LTAA)\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u91cd\u8bd5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7b51\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6700\u8fd1\u7684LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u6210\u719f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83LLM\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "LTAA\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5c42\u91cd\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u51cf\u5c11\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5206\u914d\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u5f3a\u8c03\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5173\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "LTAA\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1a\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c1194.6%\uff0c\u5206\u914d\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1186%\u3002\u5728TEACh\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684Heavy Excels\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cLTAA\u8fbe\u523077%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e73\u8861\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u3001Q-learning\u3001DQN\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u6210\u719f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u66f4\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u989d\u5916\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660eLLM\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist.

In this work, we first verify that the attention maps of these models acquire geometric correspondence throughout training, attending to the geometrically corresponding regions across reference and target views for view-consistent generation. However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models. Notably, supervising a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, thereby preserving the geometry and structure of reference images, accelerating convergence, and improving novel view synthesis performance. CAMEO reduces the number of training iterations required for convergence by half while achieving superior performance at the same iteration counts.

One hope is for quantum models to efficiently capture probability distributions that are difficult to learn and simulate by classical means alone. Quantum Boltzmann machines were proposed about one decade ago for this purpose, yet efficient training methods have remained elusive. In this paper, I overcome this obstacle by proposing a practical solution that trains quantum Boltzmann machines for Born-rule generative modeling. Two key ingredients in the proposal are the Donsker-Varadhan variational representation of the classical relative entropy and the quantum Boltzmann gradient estimator of [Patel et al., arXiv:2410.12935]. I present the main result for a more general ansatz known as an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine [Minervini et al., arXiv:2501.03367], which combines parameterized real- and imaginary-time evolution. I also show how to extend the findings to other distinguishability measures beyond relative entropy.

While diffusion transformers excel at holistic generation, their use of singular, monolithic prompts fails to disentangle distinct user intentions for content, position, and appearance. To overcome this, our method deconstructs creative intent into a stack of controllable visual cues: a content layer for what to create, a spatial layer for where to place it, a structural layer for how it is shaped, and a color layer for its palette. Our technical contributions include a specialized data generation pipeline for context-aware content integration, a unified control module to process all visual cues, and a fine-tuned spatial branch for precise local editing, including object removal.

Yang Zhang leads the whole project", "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \\textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process.

However, in real-world settings, downstream tasks may not only exhibit distributional shifts within the same label space but also introduce new or broader label spaces, leading to domain generalization challenges. In this work, we introduce novel generalization bounds that explicitly account for both types of mismatch: domain shift and domain generalization. Specifically, we analyze scenarios where downstream tasks either (i) draw classes from the same latent class space but with shifted distributions, or (ii) involve new label spaces beyond those seen during pretraining.

Several formula-based fault localisation (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs/circuits with multiple faults.\n  This paper introduces CFaults, a novel fault localisation tool for C software and Boolean circuits with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localisation procedure. Experimental results on three benchmark sets, two of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, and one of Boolean circuits, ISCAS85, show that CFaults is faster at localising faults in C software than other FBFL approaches such as BugAssist, SNIPER, and HSD. On the ISCAS85 benchmark, CFaults is generally slower than HSD; however, it localises faults in only 6% fewer circuits, demonstrating that it remains competitive in this domain. Furthermore, CFaults produces only subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses (e.g., BugAssist and SNIPER).", "AI": {"tldr": "CFaults\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8eC\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u7535\u8def\u591a\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u548cMaxSAT\u516c\u5f0f\u805a\u5408\u6240\u6709\u5931\u8d25\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8de8\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u96c6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u8c03\u8bd5\u662f\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5931\u8d25\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u90fd\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u8bca\u65ad\u96c6\u5408\uff1b2) \u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u975e\u5b50\u96c6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6545\u969c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "CFaults\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u89c2\u5bdf\uff08\u5931\u8d25\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff09\u805a\u5408\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684MaxSAT\u516c\u5f0f\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u8de8\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5de5\u5177\u9488\u5bf9C\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6545\u969c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff08TCAS\u3001C-Pack-IPAs\u3001ISCAS85\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1) \u5bf9\u4e8eC\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0cCFaults\u6bd4BugAssist\u3001SNIPER\u548cHSD\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b2) \u5bf9\u4e8eISCAS85\u7535\u8def\uff0cCFaults\u867d\u7136\u6bd4HSD\u6162\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u5728\u4ec5\u5c116%\u7684\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b3) CFaults\u53ea\u4ea7\u751f\u5b50\u96c6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u679a\u4e3e\u5197\u4f59\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "CFaults\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u548cMaxSAT\u516c\u5f0f\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8de8\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5728C\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u7535\u8def\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "relevance": 25.0}}

However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLM)\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u5168\u9762\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u66b4\u9732\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u6781\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u5173\u952e\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u88ab\u6d4b\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u5c42\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u6218\u7565\u5c42(VLM\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u786e\u5b9a)\u3001\u6218\u672f\u5c42(\u5f15\u5bfc\u51fd\u6570\u5236\u5b9a)\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c42(\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6267\u884c)\u3002\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\u771f\u5b9e\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u95ed\u73af\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u80cc\u666f\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u96c6\u6210VLM\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u63a8\u7406\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u3002\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548cVLM\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408VLM\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u5173\u952e\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "relevance": 45.0}}

We show that this brittleness primarily arises from misalignment in Spatial Modeling, rather than Physical Modeling. To address this, we propose a one-shot adaptation framework that recalibrates visual representations through lightweight, learnable updates. Our first method, Feature Token Modulation (FTM), applies a global affine transformation to visual tokens and improves Libero viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters. Building on this, Feature Linear Adaptation (FLA) introduces low-rank updates to the ViT encoder, achieving 90.8% success with 4.7M parameters -- matching LoRA-scale finetuning at far lower cost. Together, these results reveal substantial untapped robustness in pretrained VLA models and demonstrate that targeted, minimal visual adaptation is sufficient to restore viewpoint generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u6821\u51c6\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65b0\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u7279\u5f81\u4ee4\u724c\u8c03\u5236\uff08FTM\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u5e94\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\uff1b2) \u7279\u5f81\u7ebf\u6027\u9002\u5e94\uff08FLA\uff09\uff0c\u5728ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u662f\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "FTM\u4ec5\u75284K\u53c2\u6570\u5c31\u5c06Libero\u89c6\u89d2\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece48.5%\u63d0\u5347\u523087.1%\uff1bFLA\u75284.7M\u53c2\u6570\u8fbe\u523090.8%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e0eLoRA\u89c4\u6a21\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u5f53\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u89c6\u89c9\u9002\u5e94\u5c31\u8db3\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u89c6\u89d2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

Computational methods provide the necessary insights and guidance for future research. However, existing simulations typically focus on only isolated aspects of solar cells. This lack of consistency highlights the need for a framework unifying all computational levels, from material to cell properties, for accurate prediction and optimization of EY prediction. To address this challenge, a differentiable digital twin, Sol(Di)$^2$T, is introduced to enable comprehensive end-to-end optimization of solar cells. The workflow starts with material properties and morphological processing parameters, followed by optical and electrical simulations. Finally, climatic conditions and geographic location are incorporated to predict the EY. Each step is either intrinsically differentiable or replaced with a machine-learned surrogate model, enabling not only accurate EY prediction but also gradient-based optimization with respect to input parameters. Consequently, Sol(Di)$^2$T extends EY predictions to previously unexplored conditions.

Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance. This temporal-prompted approach effectively eliminates ambiguity from the visuomotor policy.

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an efficient training-image-based simulation framework capable of reproducing complex geological models with high accuracy and comparably low generative cost. However, their application in stochastic geophysical inversion for multivariate property prediction is limited, as representing multiple coupled properties requires large and unstable networks with high memory and training demands. A more recent variant of GANs with spatially adaptive denormalization (SPADE-GAN) enables the direct conditioning of facies spatial distributions on local probability maps. Leveraging on such features, an iterative geostatistical inversion algorithm is proposed, SPADE-GANInv, integrating a pre-trained SPADE-GAN with geostatistical simulation, for the prediction of facies and multiple correlated continuous properties from seismic data. The SPADE-GAN is trained to reproduce realistic facies geometries, while sequential stochastic co-simulation predicts the spatial variability of the facies-dependent continuous properties. At each iteration, a set of subsurface realizations is generated and used to compute synthetic seismic data. The realizations providing the highest similarity coefficient to the observed data are used to update the subsurface probability models in the next iteration. The method is demonstrated on both 2-D synthetic scenarios and field data, targeting the prediction of facies, porosity, and acoustic impedance from full-stack seismic data. Results show that the algorithm enables accurate multivariate prediction, mitigates the impact of biased prior data, and accommodates additional local conditioning such as well logs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSPADE-GANInv\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684SPADE-GAN\u4e0e\u5730\u8d28\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u5ca9\u76f8\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u76f8\u5173\u8fde\u7eed\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6982\u7387\u5730\u9707\u53cd\u6f14\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5730\u8d28\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff08\u5982\u5ca9\u76f8\uff09\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u5ca9\u77f3\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\u3002\u4f20\u7edfGANs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u8026\u5408\u5c5e\u6027\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u968f\u673a\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u53cd\u6f14\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSPADE-GANInv\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684SPADE-GAN\uff08\u5177\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53bb\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff09\u4e0e\u5730\u8d28\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u3002SPADE-GAN\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u5ca9\u76f8\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u987a\u5e8f\u968f\u673a\u534f\u540c\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u5ca9\u76f8\u4f9d\u5b58\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u5730\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5408\u6210\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u5730\u4e0b\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57282D\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5168\u53e0\u52a0\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5ca9\u76f8\u3001\u5b54\u9699\u5ea6\u548c\u58f0\u963b\u6297\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u6709\u504f\u5148\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u6d4b\u4e95\u6570\u636e\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "SPADE-GANInv\u4e3a\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5730\u8d28\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5730\u8d28\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5730\u8d28\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u826f\u597d\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "relevance": 15.0}}

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the generation of synthetic participant data by prompting models to answer items while impersonating individuals of specific demographic profiles, potentially allowing in silico piloting before real data collection. Across four preregistered studies (N = circa 300 each), we tested whether LLM-simulated datasets can reproduce the latent structures and measurement properties of human responses. In Studies 1-2, we compared LLM-generated data with real datasets for two validated scales; in Studies 3-4, we created new scales using EFA on simulated data and then examined whether these structures generalized to newly collected human samples. Simulated datasets replicated the intended factor structures in three of four studies and showed consistent configural and metric invariance, with scalar invariance achieved for the two newly developed scales. However, correlation-based tests revealed substantial differences between real and synthetic datasets, and notable discrepancies appeared in score distributions and variances. Thus, while LLMs capture group-level latent structures, they do not approximate individual-level data properties. Simulated datasets also showed full internal invariance across gender. Overall, LLM-generated data appear useful for early-stage, group-level psychometric prototyping, but not as substitutes for individual-level validation. We discuss methodological limitations, risks of bias and data pollution, and ethical considerations related to in silico psychometric simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u91cf\u8868\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u539f\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u590d\u5236\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u6570\u636e\u5c5e\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u91cf\u8868\u5f00\u53d1\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u8bd5\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u9879\u9884\u6ce8\u518c\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u6bcf\u9879\u7ea6300\u4eba\uff09\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5LLM\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7279\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a761-2\u6bd4\u8f83LLM\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cf\u8868\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u7814\u7a763-4\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u6790\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u91cf\u8868\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u68c0\u9a8c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u5426\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u65b0\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u56db\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u9879\u590d\u5236\u4e86\u9884\u671f\u56e0\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u5f00\u53d1\u91cf\u8868\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6807\u91cf\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5206\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u5f02\u3002LLM\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u539f\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u9650\u5236\u3001\u504f\u89c1\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "relevance": 75.0}}

However, the lack of scalable, synchronized, and high-resolution tools for multimodal data acquisition continues to be a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Multimodal Learning Analytics in real-world educational settings. This paper presents two complementary tools developed to address these challenges: Watch-DMLT, a data acquisition application for Fitbit Sense 2 smartwatches that enables real-time, multi-user monitoring of physiological and motion signals; and ViSeDOPS, a dashboard-based visualization system for analyzing synchronized multimodal data collected during oral presentations.

Previous work has largely focused on predicting precursors or reaction conditions, but only rarely on full synthesis pathways. We introduce the ActionGraph, a directed acyclic graph framework that encodes both the chemical and procedural structure, in terms of synthesis operations, of inorganic synthesis reactions. Using 13,017 text-mined solid-state synthesis reactions from the Materials Project, we show that incorporating PCA-reduced ActionGraph adjacency matrices into a $k$-nearest neighbors retrieval model significantly improves synthesis pathway prediction. While the ActionGraph framework only results in a 1.34% and 2.76% increase in precursor and operation F1 scores (average over varying numbers of PCA components) respectively, the operation length matching accuracy rises 3.4 times (from 15.8% to 53.3%). We observe an interesting trade-off where precursor prediction performance peaks at 10-11 PCA components while operation prediction continues improving up to 30 components. This suggests composition information dominates precursor selection while structural information is critical for operation sequencing. Overall, the ActionGraph framework demonstrates strong potential, and with further adoption, its full range of benefits can be effectively realized.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faActionGraph\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u65e0\u673a\u6750\u6599\u5408\u6210\u53cd\u5e94\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u65b0\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u65e0\u673a\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u5408\u6210\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6750\u6599\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9884\u6d4b\u524d\u9a71\u4f53\u6216\u53cd\u5e94\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u6d89\u53ca\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u9884\u6d4b", "method": "\u63d0\u51faActionGraph\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u5408\u6210\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5408\u6210\u64cd\u4f5c\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u752813,017\u4e2a\u4eceMaterials Project\u6587\u672c\u6316\u6398\u7684\u56fa\u6001\u5408\u6210\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5c06PCA\u964d\u7ef4\u7684ActionGraph\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u7ed3\u5408\u5230k\u8fd1\u90bb\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d", "result": "ActionGraph\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u524d\u9a71\u4f53\u548c\u64cd\u4f5cF1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad81.34%\u548c2.76%\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u957f\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece15.8%\u63d0\u5347\u81f353.3%\uff083.4\u500d\uff09\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u8da3\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u524d\u9a71\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u572810-11\u4e2aPCA\u6210\u5206\u65f6\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u64cd\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u81f330\u4e2a\u6210\u5206", "conclusion": "ActionGraph\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6210\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u524d\u9a71\u4f53\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u800c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u968f\u7740\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u5168\u90e8\u4f18\u52bf\u5c06\u5f97\u5230\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0", "relevance": 35.0}}

Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

Deep learning provides a powerful alternative to traditional inference, but existing neural models typically lack the flexibility to handle variations in data analysis settings. Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%. Our approach thus demonstrates flexible and scalable inference with a principled framework for handling missing or incomplete data -- key capabilities for current and next-generation observatories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Dingo-T1\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u5982\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u9891\u7387\u8303\u56f4\u7b49\uff09", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5355\u4e00\u7075\u6d3b\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u80fd\u529b", "result": "Dingo-T1\u80fd\u591f\u5206\u679048\u4e2a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u63a8\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u4ece1.4%\u63d0\u5347\u52304.2%", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49", "relevance": 35.0}}

Lumos is an imperative probabilistic programming DSL over graphs, with constructs to generate independent and identically distributed prompts for LMS. It offers a structured view of prompt distributions via graphs, forming random prompts from sampled subgraphs. Lumos supports certifying LMS for arbitrary prompt distributions via integration with statistical certifiers. We provide hybrid (operational and denotational) semantics for Lumos, providing a rigorous way to interpret the specifications. Using only a small set of composable constructs, Lumos can encode existing LMS specifications, including complex relational and temporal specifications. It also facilitates specifying new properties - we present the first safety specifications for vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving scenarios developed with Lumos. Using these, we show that the state-of-the-art VLM Qwen-VL exhibits critical safety failures, producing incorrect and unsafe responses with at least 90% probability in right-turn scenarios under rainy driving conditions, revealing substantial safety risks. Lumos's modular structure allows easy modification of the specifications, enabling LMS certification to stay abreast with the rapidly evolving threat landscape. We further demonstrate that specification programs written in Lumos enable finding specific failure cases exhibited by state-of-the-art LMS. Lumos is the first systematic and extensible language-based framework for specifying and certifying LMS behaviors, paving the way for a wider adoption of LMS certification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lumos\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6982\u7387\u7f16\u7a0b\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u5feb\u901f\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u73af\u5883\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u786e\u4fddLLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "Lumos\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u547d\u4ee4\u5f0f\u6982\u7387\u7f16\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u91c7\u6837\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u968f\u673a\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\uff08\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u6307\u79f0\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u610f\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684LMS\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528Lumos\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684VLM Qwen-VL\u5728\u96e8\u5929\u53f3\u8f6c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u81f3\u5c1190%\u6982\u7387\u4ea7\u751f\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u54cd\u5e94\u3002Lumos\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u73b0\u6709LMS\u89c4\u8303\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u65b0\u5c5e\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "Lumos\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684LMS\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528LMS\u8ba4\u8bc1\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002\u5176\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u4fbf\u4e8e\u89c4\u8303\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4f7f\u8ba4\u8bc1\u80fd\u8ddf\u4e0a\u5feb\u901f\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u73af\u5883\u3002", "relevance": 85.0}}

Our methodological pipeline consists in combinations of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), Riemannian geometry, functional connectivity, and fractal- or entropy-based features across three open-access EEG datasets. Unlike prior studies, our analysis operates at the per-participant level and across multiple frequency bands (8-15 Hz and 8-30 Hz), enabling direct assessment of both group-level performance and individual variability. Covariance tangent space projection (cov-tgsp) and CSP consistently achieved the highest average classification accuracies. However, their effectiveness was strongly dataset-dependent, and marked participant-level differences persisted, particularly in the most heterogeneous of the datasets. Importantly, nonlinear methods outperformed spatial approaches for specific individuals, underscoring the need for personalized pipeline selection. Our findings highlight that no universal 'one-size-fits-all' method can optimally decode EEG motor imagery patterns across all users or datasets.

Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMP across a diverse suite of control tasks with physically simulated humanoid characters.

It focuses in particular on the derivation and identification of physically consistent models, which are essential for model-based control synthesis. Lagrangian or Hamiltonian neural networks provide useful structural guarantees but the learning of such models often leads to inconsistent models, especially on real physical systems where training data are limited, partial and noisy. Motivated by this observation and the objective to exploit these models for model-based nonlinear control, a learning algorithm relying on an original loss function is proposed to improve the physical consistency of Lagrangian systems. A comparative analysis of different learning-based modeling approaches with the proposed solution shows significant improvements in terms of physical consistency of the learned models, on both simulated and experimental systems. The model's consistency is then exploited to demonstrate, on an experimental benchmark, the practical relevance of the proposed methodology for feedback linearization and energy-based control techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u6216\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u4e14\u5608\u6742\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6240\u63d0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53cd\u9988\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "relevance": 25.0}}
