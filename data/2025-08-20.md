TL;DR: 论文研究了推理能力对LLM习语检测性能的影响，发现推理效果比预期小且多变。小模型通过CoT推理有所提升但不及基础模型，大模型有适度改进。大模型能准确理解习语含义，小模型则常失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索推理能力如何影响LLM的习语检测性能，以及模型规模的影响，因为习语检测需要先理解再推理的逻辑步骤。

Method: 使用DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型系列(1.5B-70B参数)在四个习语检测数据集上进行评估，分析CoT推理的效果，并为小模型提供定义提示进行实验。

Result: 推理效果比预期小：小模型CoT推理能提升数学调优中间模型的性能但不及基础模型；大模型(14B/32B/70B)有适度改进；大模型能准确理解习语含义，小模型常失败；为小模型提供定义提示可在某些情况下改善性能。

Conclusion: 模型规模对习语理解至关重要，大模型展现更好的语义理解能力；推理能力的影响有限且因模型规模而异；外部知识(如定义提示)可帮助小模型提升性能。

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

*Ayoub Ben Chaliah,Hela Dellagi*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 85.0

TL;DR: Datarus-R1-14B是一个14B参数的开源语言模型，基于Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct微调，专门用于数据分析和研究生级别问题求解。采用轨迹式训练方法，结合双奖励框架和GRPO优化，在多个基准测试中超越同规模模型，达到更大模型的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在复杂问题求解时存在推理循环、token膨胀、格式崩溃等问题，需要开发能够产生完整分析轨迹、支持代码执行和自我修正的专业化模型。

Method: 1) 轨迹中心合成数据生成器产生144,000个标记的笔记本片段；2) 双奖励框架（轻量级结构信号+分层奖励模型）；3) 内存优化的GRPO实现；4) 余弦课程学习从结构保真度平滑过渡到语义深度

Result: 在标准基准测试中超越同规模模型，达到QwQ-32B等更大推理模型的水平，AIME 2024/2025和LiveCodeBench准确率提升30%，同时每个解决方案减少18-49%的token数量

Conclusion: Datarus展示了通过轨迹式训练和双奖励框架可以有效解决LLM推理中的常见问题，实现更高效、更准确的研究生级别问题求解能力

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

TL;DR: 该论文通过参数高效微调方法，利用母语者的自由词汇联想规范来提升LLM的文化对齐能力，在英语和中文上都取得了显著效果提升，7-8B模型性能可媲美70B基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在跨文化沟通中存在分布偏差问题，主要反映预训练语料中过度代表的语言和观点，需要找到成本效益高的文化对齐方法。

Method: 使用Small-World-of-Words项目的英语-美国和普通话词汇联想数据，通过监督微调(SFT)和基于PPO的偏好优化对Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B进行参数高效微调。

Result: SFT在英语上提升P@5指标16-20%，在中文上提升43-165%；中位具体性提升+0.20；达到人类水平的效价和唤醒度；在世界价值观调查问题上，答案分布向目标文化偏移；在高张力问题上，中文对齐响应翻倍，美国偏见下降三分之一。

Conclusion: 几百万个基于文化的联想足以实现价值对齐，无需昂贵的重新训练，7-8B模型可媲美或超越70B基线模型，凸显了基于人类认知的文化对齐研究的重要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

TL;DR: ProMed是一个强化学习框架，通过Shapley信息增益奖励机制，使医疗大语言模型从被动回答转向主动提问的交互范式，显著提升医疗诊断准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型主要采用被动回答模式，缺乏主动信息收集能力，在真实临床交互场景中存在误诊风险。需要让模型具备主动提问能力来获取关键临床信息

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：1)SIG引导的模型初始化使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高奖励交互轨迹；2)SIG增强的策略优化结合Shapley信息增益奖励和奖励分布机制

Result: 在两个新构建的部分信息医疗基准测试中，ProMed平均优于最先进方法6.29%，相比被动范式提升54.45%，且在域外案例中表现鲁棒

Conclusion: ProMed成功将医疗LLM从被动范式转向主动交互范式，通过强化学习和信息理论奖励机制显著提升了临床决策的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个二维信任等价评估框架，发现即使压缩模型与原始大模型在准确率上几乎相同，但在可解释性对齐和校准相似性方面存在显著差异，表明压缩模型不能作为大模型的直接可信替代品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注压缩对准确率的影响，但性能对等并不能保证信任等价。需要评估压缩模型是否能够像原始大模型一样被信任，特别是在可解释性和校准可靠性方面。

Method: 提出二维评估框架：1) 可解释性对齐（使用LIME和SHAP测试测量模型是否基于相同的输入特征进行预测）；2) 校准相似性（使用ECE、MCE、Brier Score和可靠性图评估预测概率的可靠性）。使用BERT-base及其压缩变体在自然语言推理和复述识别任务上进行实验。

Result: 结果显示即使准确率几乎相同，压缩模型与原始大模型在可解释性对齐方面很低，校准相似性存在显著不匹配。压缩模型不是信任等价的。

Conclusion: 部署压缩模型作为大模型的直接替代品需要超越性能对等的仔细评估，不能简单地信任压缩模型的预测。

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

TL;DR: CRISP是一种基于稀疏自编码器的参数高效方法，用于实现大语言模型中的持久性概念遗忘，能够自动识别并抑制多层的显著特征，在安全关键任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，需要选择性移除有害知识同时保持模型效用的需求变得至关重要。现有稀疏自编码器方法主要在推理时操作，无法实现参数层面的持久改变，容易被恶意行为者绕过。

Method: CRISP使用稀疏自编码器自动识别跨多个层的显著特征，并通过抑制这些特征的激活来实现参数高效的持久性概念遗忘。该方法在特征层面进行操作，实现目标概念和良性概念的语义分离。

Result: 在两个大语言模型上的实验表明，CRISP在WMDP基准测试的安全关键遗忘任务中优于先前方法，成功移除有害知识的同时保持了一般和领域内能力。特征级分析显示该方法实现了语义一致的目标特征抑制。

Conclusion: CRISP提供了一种有效的参数级概念遗忘方法，解决了推理时干预的局限性，为大语言模型的安全部署提供了重要技术手段。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在非单调逻辑中的默认推理能力，特别是处理泛型概括（如'鸟会飞'）的复杂异常容忍行为，这对语言学家、哲学家和认知科学家具有重要意义。

Method: 使用20种可废止推理模式测试28个LLM，比较零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略，分析模型区分可废止推理和演绎推理的能力。

Result: 前沿模型能较好处理默认推理，但性能差异显著；少样本提示略有改善，思维链提示导致平均准确率下降11.14%；多数模型难以区分可废止推理和演绎推理。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在默认推理方面既有潜力也有局限，需要改进对泛型陈述的理解和推理能力。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

Motivation: 理解深度学习模型中隐含的知识对于提高AI系统可解释性至关重要。现有方法通过将词嵌入映射到人类可解释的语义特征来评估知识编码，但作者质疑仅凭预测准确性是否能真正反映嵌入中的语义知识。

Method: 通过实验证明现有方法即使对随机信息也能获得高预测准确性，分析这些映射方法主要反映向量空间几何相似性而非语义特性。

Result: 预测准确性不能可靠地指示词嵌入中真正的基于特征的可解释性，比较不同数据集时仅基于预测性能不可靠。

Conclusion: 需要开发更可靠的方法来评估词嵌入中语义知识的编码，当前基于预测准确性的方法存在根本性缺陷。

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

Motivation: LLMs在需要事实严谨性的领域中经常表现出奉承行为，即不顾正确性而迎合用户信念。这种倾向在基于偏好的对齐技术中被强化，可能损害真实性，在高风险的科学问答环境中尤其危险。

Method: 提出了统一的评估框架来量化奉承性上下文对科学问答中模型行为的影响，包括对抗性提示设置和针对性指标（误导抵抗和奉承抵抗）。开发了Pressure-Tune方法，通过在合成对抗性对话上进行轻量级微调，配合思维链推理来拒绝用户错误信息。

Result: 对开源和专有模型的系统评估显示普遍存在的奉承倾向，主要由对齐策略而非模型大小驱动。Pressure-Tune显著增强了奉承抵抗能力，同时不损害准确性或对有效反馈的响应性。

Conclusion: 奉承是LLMs中一个严重但被低估的问题，Pressure-Tune提供了一种实用的方法来提升模型的事实一致性和原则性行为，对构建更可信的AI系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

Abstract: How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more

Motivation: 大型语言模型在控制文本长度方面存在挑战，经常超出或达不到显式长度指令，因为它们无法可靠地保持内部token计数。需要一种轻量级的方法来实现精确的长度控制。

Method: 基于提示工程的一次性策略，在提示中添加倒计时标记和明确计数规则，使模型在生成时进行计数。无需微调或迭代采样。

Result: 在MT-Bench-LI上，GPT-4.1的严格长度符合率从低于30%提升到95%以上，超过了流行的草稿-修订基线方法，同时保持了答案质量。在多个设置（开放生成、摘要、指令跟随等）上都取得了良好效果。

Conclusion: 仅通过提示工程就能实现精确的长度控制，为训练或解码方法提供了轻量级替代方案。

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

TL;DR: 论文提出SvS策略，通过自对弈和变分问题合成来解决RLVR训练中的熵崩溃问题，显著提升LLM在复杂推理任务中的Pass@k性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练虽然能提高Pass@1性能，但会导致策略熵下降，减少生成多样性，从而限制Pass@k性能的上限

Method: 提出在线自对弈变分问题合成(SvS)策略，利用策略的正确解合成变分问题，保持参考答案不变，有效维持训练过程中的策略熵

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准上Pass@32性能分别获得18.3%和22.8%的绝对提升，在12个推理基准和3B到32B不同模型规模上均显示出一致有效性

Conclusion: SvS策略能有效缓解RLVR训练中的熵崩溃问题，显著提升LLM的推理能力上限，具有很好的泛化性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

Motivation: LLM智能体在微调过程中经常忽视安全问题，导致对齐的LLM在执行代理任务时可能变得不对齐，更容易执行有害任务且拒绝倾向降低。

Method: 提出Prefix INjection Guard (PING)方法，采用迭代方法：(1)生成候选前缀，(2)选择优化任务性能和拒绝行为的前缀，将其预置到智能体响应中。

Conclusion: PING是一种简单有效的安全增强方法，通过自然语言前缀指导智能体拒绝有害请求，同时保持良性任务性能。

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new

Method: 使用私有沙特方言指令数据集(5,466对合成指令-响应对)，采用LoRA微调ALLaM-7B模型，比较两种变体：带方言标签训练和无标签训练

Result: 方言标签模型将沙特方言生成率从47.97%提升至84.21%，MSA泄露从32.63%降至6.21%，保真度指标显著提升(chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059)，优于多个基线模型

Conclusion: LoRA微调结合方言标签控制能有效提升阿拉伯语LLM的方言生成能力，为低资源方言支持提供了可行方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

Conclusion: 解码策略在医疗应用中的影响有时甚至超过模型选择，需要谨慎选择解码方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

Result: Bark模型没有表现出系统性偏见，但显示出性别意识并存在一定的性别倾向。

Conclusion: 语音大语言模型虽然不像文本模型那样编码隐性的性别关联，但通过显性的说话人选择仍然可能反映训练数据或模型设计中的模式，需要持续关注和监测。

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过从LLaMA模型蒸馏上下文知识来增强Whisper ASR系统的方法，使用token级蒸馏和表示损失最小化策略，在长音频转录中显著提升了WER、NER、大小写和标点性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统在长音频转录中经常难以保持语法和语义准确性，影响NER、大小写和标点等任务，需要集成语言上下文来提高转录质量

Method: 使用两种策略：(1) token级蒸馏与最优传输对齐维度和序列长度，(2) Whisper和LLaMA句子嵌入之间的表示损失最小化，融合语法和语义

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上评估显示，在WER、NER、大小写和标点方面都有显著改进

Conclusion: 通过引入新颖的NER指标和探索语义感知ASR，这项工作凸显了将语言上下文集成到转录中的价值，为长语音中稳健、上下文感知的ASR奠定了基础

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

TL;DR: MGT-Prism是一个从频域角度检测机器生成文本的新方法，通过低频滤波和动态频谱对齐来提高跨域泛化能力，在11个测试数据集上平均准确率和F1分数分别提升0.90%和0.92%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器生成文本检测器在同域训练测试时表现良好，但在跨域场景下由于域偏移问题泛化能力差。需要开发能够捕捉域不变特征的检测方法。

Method: 从频域角度分析文本表示，发现机器生成文本和人类写作文本在频谱模式上存在显著差异。设计低频域滤波模块过滤对域偏移敏感的文档级特征，采用动态频谱对齐策略提取任务特定且域不变的特征。

Result: 在三个域泛化场景的11个测试数据集上，MGT-Prism平均准确率提升0.90%，F1分数提升0.92%，显著优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 频域分析为机器生成文本检测提供了新的视角，低频滤波和频谱对齐策略能有效提升检测器的跨域泛化性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型生成儿童语言的能力，通过比较LLM生成的文本与德国儿童对图片故事的描述，发现在词汇丰富度、词频分布、语义相似度等方面存在显著差异，few-shot提示仅能略微改善相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在教育中的应用增加，需要了解LLM生成的文本是否能够真实模拟儿童语言特征，这对教育工具的开发具有重要意义。

Method: 使用相同的图片故事生成两个LLM语料库（零样本和少样本提示），通过心理语言学文本属性（词频、词汇丰富度、句子长度、词性标注、词嵌入语义相似度）进行比较分析。

Result: LLM生成的文本更长但词汇丰富度更低，更多依赖高频词，名词使用不足。语义向量空间分析显示低相似性，few-shot提示仅略微提高相似性但仍无法复制词汇和语义模式。

Conclusion: LLM在通过多模态提示模拟儿童语言方面存在局限，这对心理语言学研究和教育应用提出了重要问题，需要谨慎考虑LLM生成语言在儿童教育工具中的适用性。

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

Motivation: 解决LLM生成医学摘要时的事实准确性担忧，通过提供句子级引用让用户能够追溯原始上下文来验证摘要准确性。

Method: 1) 标注500个医学摘要的7个关键医学方面，创建3.5K个摘要-引用对；2) 提出包含四个指标的细粒度评估框架；3) 引入Track-Then-Sum摘要流水线作为基线方法。

Result: 实验表明TracSum可作为有效的基准，显式执行句子级追踪能提高生成准确性，融入完整上下文能进一步提升完整性。

Conclusion: TracSum为可追溯、基于方面的摘要任务提供了有效基准，追踪机制和完整上下文对提升摘要质量至关重要。

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

Abstract: In the digital era, user interactions with various resources such as
databases, data warehouses, websites, and knowledge graphs (KGs) are
increasingly mediated through digital platforms. These interactions leave
behind digital traces, systematically captured in the form of logs. Logs, when
effectively exploited, provide high value across industry and academia,
supporting critical services (e.g., recovery and security), user-centric
applications (e.g., recommender systems), and quality-of-service improvements
(e.g., performance optimization). Despite their importance, research on log
usage remains fragmented across domains, and no comprehensive study currently
consolidates existing efforts. This paper presents a systematic survey of log
usage, focusing on Database (DB), Data Warehouse (DW), Web, and KG logs. More
than 300 publications were analyzed to address three central questions: (1) do
different types of logs share common structural and functional characteristics?
(2) are there standard pipelines for their usage? (3) which constraints and
non-functional requirements (NFRs) guide their exploitation?. The survey
reveals a limited number of end-to-end approaches, the absence of
standardization across log usage pipelines, and the existence of shared
structural elements among different types of logs. By consolidating existing
knowledge, identifying gaps, and highlighting opportunities, this survey
provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of log
usage and sheds light on promising directions for future research, particularly
regarding the exploitation and democratization of KG logs.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于几何知识引导的分布校准框架，利用视觉基础模型（如CLIP、DINOv2）提取的特征分布几何形状的跨域可迁移性，来解决联邦学习和长尾识别中的数据分布偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习面临观测训练样本与真实分布之间存在差距的挑战，这种差距由采样偏差、噪声等多种因素造成。在基础模型时代，作者发现现成的视觉基础模型提取的特征分布几何形状具有显著的跨域可迁移性，这为解决数据异构性和样本不平衡问题提供了新思路。

Method: 提出了几何知识引导的分布校准框架：1）在联邦学习中，设计在隐私约束下获取全局几何形状的技术，并利用该知识为客户端生成新样本以弥合本地和全局观测之间的差距；2）在长尾学习中，利用从样本丰富类别转移的几何知识来恢复样本稀缺尾类的真实分布。

Result: 综合实验表明，所提出的几何知识引导分布校准方法有效克服了由数据异构性和样本不平衡引起的信息缺陷，在多个基准测试中实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了基础模型特征分布的几何形状具有跨域可迁移性，为解决联邦学习和长尾识别中的数据分布偏差问题提供了有效的解决方案，展现了在隐私约束和数据不平衡场景下的实用价值。

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)在端到端文档图像解析方面表现出色，但存在幻觉问题（生成输入图像中不存在的词语），且在OCR任务上不如专门训练的专家模型有效

Method: 提出推理增强框架DianJin-OCR-R1：1）模型首先利用自身OCR能力识别图像内容；2）调用其他专家模型工具获取参考结果；3）重新审视图像并反思推理过程，提供最终识别内容

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench基准测试中，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理对应模型和专家OCR模型，证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 通过推理和工具交织的方法，可以有效缓解LVLMs的幻觉问题，利用专家模型的优势提升性能，同时专家模型规模较小、易于迭代，能以较低成本实现性能提升

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个即插即用的视觉token修剪框架，用于自动驾驶中的多视角视觉语言模型，通过多样性感知token选择和视图自适应修剪控制器，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度和减少内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中的视觉语言模型需要处理高分辨率多视角图像，产生大量视觉token导致计算开销巨大（注意力机制二次复杂度），阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 提出两种核心创新：1）受最远点采样启发的多样性感知token选择机制，优先考虑跨视图的语义和空间覆盖；2）基于视图重要性的自适应修剪控制器，学习每个摄像头视图的最佳修剪比例。无需模型重训练或注意力图访问。

Result: 在两个大规模多视角驾驶基准测试（DriveLM和DriveLMM-o1）上，仅保留10%视觉token时实现6.4倍预填充加速，FLOPs降至13.4%，性能仅下降3%。

Conclusion: Prune2Drive为多视角VLM提供了一种高效实用的token修剪解决方案，在保持任务性能的同时显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical

identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

Method: 通过接地实验分析偏差来源，开发GroundAttack工具包自动生成视觉上合理的困难负选项，创建新的EOB-free标注数据集。

Result: 在EOB-free标注上，当前VLMs在(V+O)设置下接近随机准确率，在(V+Q+O)设置下准确率显著下降，提供了更真实的VLM问答能力评估。

Conclusion: 揭示了多选VQA基准中的系统性偏差问题，提出的解决方案能够提供更可靠的VLM评估基准，对VLM能力评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中依赖已知类别的异常样本先验知识，限制了跨类别泛化能力。本文旨在开发一个无需重新训练的统一模型，仅使用正常参考图像就能检测未知类别的视觉异常。

Method: 提出三组件框架：1）字典构建-使用正常参考图像特征模拟字典索引和内容；2）字典查找-通过稀疏查找策略检索查询区域特征，无法检索的特征被分类为异常；3）查询判别正则化-通过对比查询约束和文本对齐约束增强异常判别能力。

Result: 在7个工业和医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods。

Conclusion: DictAS通过自监督字典查找机制成功实现了无需重新训练的跨类别异常检测，为少样本异常分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Result: 大多数模型能可靠识别0°图像，部分能识别180°图像，但所有模型都无法可靠区分90°和270°旋转。辅助信息和思维链提示只有微小改善，微调也无法改善90°/270°区分能力

Conclusion: MLLMs在旋转识别任务上存在显著能力缺口，其空间推理能力远低于人类感知水平，这暴露了当前多模态模型在基础视觉理解方面的局限性

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在单图像任务上表现优异，但在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互干扰，出现跨图像信息泄漏现象。

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：1）顺序将所有图像除一张外都用随机噪声掩码，引导模型专注于单张干净图像；2）对所有目标图像重复此过程获得部分掩码上下文下的logits；3）聚合logits并使用纯噪声参考输入进行对比精炼，抑制信息泄漏。

Conclusion: FOCUS为多图像推理提供了一个通用且实用的解决方案，能够有效缓解跨图像信息泄漏问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，为对比学习中的数据投毒后门攻击提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Motivation: 现有基于量化的标记化方法（如VQ-GAN）主要关注外观特征如纹理和颜色，往往忽略几何结构。需要开发能够更好编码结构化视觉信息的标记化方法。

Method: 提出视觉高斯量化（VGQ）框架，将图像潜在表示编码为2D高斯分布，直接建模位置、旋转和尺度等结构相关参数，通过增加2D高斯密度来提升重建保真度。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256基准上，VGQ实现了rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93的最先进重建性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ通过集成2D高斯分布有效解决了传统量化方法在结构建模方面的局限性，在重建质量和视觉丰富性之间提供了灵活的权衡。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Conclusion: DiffIER方法有效解决了训练-推理差距问题，提高了生成质量和对引导权重的鲁棒性，具有广泛的适用性

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%

Method: DAASH采用多阶段框架：每个阶段使用学习到的自适应权重聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，通过新颖的元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上的对抗训练模型上，DAASH显著优于最先进的感知攻击方法AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，在SSIM、LPIPS和FID指标上分别提升约11、0.015和5.7。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，为评估鲁棒性提供了一个实用且强大的基线，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Motivation: 传统的隐式神经表示(INR)为每张图像使用单独的MLP网络，导致编码多图像时计算和存储效率低下。作者观察到不同INR的中间层权重分布高度相似，因此希望通过共享这些层来提高效率。

Method: 1) 分析训练好的INR中间层权重分布相似性；2) 在多图像编码中共享中间层，仅保留输入输出层为图像特定；3) 为每张图像设计额外的投影层来捕获独特特征

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中，MINR能够节省高达60%的参数，同时保持可比性能。特别地，MINR能够有效扩展到处理100张图像，平均PSNR保持在34dB。

Conclusion: MINR通过共享中间层实现了多图像编码的高效参数利用，证明了隐式神经表示中权重分布的相似性特征可以被有效利用来提升模型效率。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-

innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

Motivation: 现有方法使用耦合编码器同时处理语义和几何先验，导致模型需要在冲突需求之间做出权衡，限制了整体性能。为了解决这个问题，需要设计能够有效分离和优化这两种先验的方法。

Method: 提出双解耦框架：1）源级解耦 - 基础编码器提供语义特征先验和立体成本体积；2）路径级解耦 - 通过专门路径细化先验；使用混合视图变换生成互补3D特征；引入轴感知融合模块各向异性地融合特征。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: IPGA是一种针对视觉语言模型的对抗攻击方法，通过攻击投影器模块的中间阶段（Q-Former）来实现更细粒度的攻击控制，相比现有方法在全局图像描述和细粒度视觉问答任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在视觉语言模型中存在局限性：1）将丰富视觉语义压缩为单一全局向量，限制了攻击粒度；2）忽视了投影器模块这一视觉编码器和语言模型之间的关键语义桥梁，无法完全破坏视觉-语言对齐流程。

Method: 提出Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA)：1）首次利用投影器模块的中间阶段（Q-Former）进行攻击；2）使用仅在视觉-语言对齐第一阶段预训练的Q-Former，不进行LLM微调；3）提出Residual Query Alignment (RQA)来保留无关视觉内容。

Result: 实验表明IPGA在标准全局图像描述任务和细粒度视觉问答任务中均优于现有方法，在黑盒环境下具有更好的攻击效果，并能成功迁移到多个商业VLM（Google Gemini、OpenAI GPT）。

Conclusion: IPGA通过攻击投影器中间阶段实现了更精确的对抗扰动控制，提高了攻击效果和可迁移性，为VLM安全评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

Conclusion: VisionLaw成功解决了从视觉观察推断内在动力学的挑战，通过结合LLM的物理知识和视觉仿真评估，实现了可解释且泛化能力强的内在动力学建模。

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Conclusion: TCA框架通过利用SNN独特的时间特性，显著提高了对抗攻击的效率，为SNN在实时应用中的安全部署提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,

autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural

capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50

complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy

well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE能够基于用户定义的曝光时间预算自适应选择最优曝光参数，比传统解决方案找到更好的曝光调度方案。

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron

Motivation: SMPLify在3D人体姿态估计中作为基准方法，但迭代优化计算成本高，限制了实用性。受其他领域用神经网络替代迭代优化的启发，作者希望开发更高效的神经逆运动学方法

Method: 提出可学习的SMPLify框架，包含时序采样策略构建训练数据、以人为中心的归一化方案和残差学习来缩小解空间，支持序列推理和插件式后处理

Result: 相比SMPLify实现近200倍加速，在未见过的3DPW和RICH数据集上泛化良好，作为插件工具在LucidAction上模型无关地工作

Conclusion: 该方法建立了实用简单的基准，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的效率，同时保持了精度和泛化能力

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Conclusion: 通过改进分割头设计、优化特征提取流程和引入时序上下文细化模块，显著提升了参考视频对象分割的准确性和质量

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,

large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video

its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

Method: 将任务解耦为候选顶点检测、相邻顶点预测、初始图构建和图扩展四个步骤，实现了动态顶点（边）插入的同时保持快速推理速度。

Result: 在CityScale和SpaceNet基准测试中达到最先进性能，比之前的SOTA方法RNGDet++在CityScale上提升了4.62 APLS和10.18 IoU，同时推理速度快约10倍。

Conclusion: DeH4R通过创新的混合架构成功平衡了拓扑保真度、空间一致性和计算效率，为道路网络提取提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more

Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an

vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,

Method: 使用多种教师模型（标准3DGS、噪声增强变体、dropout正则化版本）输出聚合来指导轻量学生模型优化，并提出结构相似性损失来保持空间几何分布一致性

Result: 在多个数据集上的综合评估显示，Distilled-3DGS在渲染质量和存储效率方面都取得了有希望的结果

Conclusion: 该框架简单有效，无需复杂技巧就能实现高质量的渲染和存储效率提升

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和模型能有效利用详细视频描述和密集修改文本，显著提升组合视频检索性能

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity for efficient
scene rendering by representing scenes as explicit sets of anisotropic 3D
Gaussians. However, most existing work focuses primarily on modeling external

is crucial for applications that require a deep understanding of an object's
interior. By directly modeling a continuous volumetric density through the
inner 3D Gaussian distribution, our model effectively reconstructs smooth and
detailed internal structures from sparse sliced data. Our approach eliminates
the need for camera poses, is plug-and-play, and is inherently compatible with
any data modalities. We provide cuda implementation at:

Abstract: Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for evaluating the prognosis of
cancer patients. Present WSI-based prognosis studies generally follow a
conventional paradigm -- cancer-specific model development -- where one cancer
disease corresponds to one model and this model cannot make use of the
prognostic knowledge from others. Despite its notable success in recent years,
this paradigm has inherent limitations and has always been struggling with
practical requirements: (i) scaling to the rare tumor diseases with very
limited samples and (ii) benefiting from the generalizable prognostic knowledge
in other cancers. To this end, this paper presents the first systematic study
on Prognostic Knowledge Transfer in Pathology, called Path-PKT. It comprises
three main parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 13 cancers
and use it to evaluate the transferability of prognostic knowledge between
different cancers computationally. (2) We design experiments to understand what
factors affect knowledge transfer and what causes positive transfers. (3)
Motivated by empirical findings, we propose a new baseline approach (MoE-PKT)
with a routing mechanism to utilize the generalizable prognostic knowledge in
other cancers. Finally, we show the transferability of source models to rare
tumor diseases. This study could lay solid foundations for the study of
knowledge transfer in WSI-based cancer prognosis. Source code is available at

Abstract: High-throughput screening using automated microscopes is a key driver in
biopharma drug discovery, enabling the parallel evaluation of thousands of drug
candidates for diseases such as cancer. Traditional image analysis and deep
learning approaches have been employed to analyze these complex, large-scale
datasets, with cell segmentation serving as a critical step for extracting
relevant structures. However, both strategies typically require extensive
manual parameter tuning or domain-specific model fine-tuning. We present a
novel method that applies a segmentation foundation model in a zero-shot
setting (i.e., without fine-tuning), guided by an in-context learning strategy.
Our approach employs a three-step process for nuclei, cell, and subcellular
segmentation, introducing a self-prompting mechanism that encodes morphological
and topological priors using growing masks and strategically placed
foreground/background points. We validate our method on both standard cell
segmentation benchmarks and industry-relevant hit validation assays,
demonstrating that it accurately segments biologically relevant structures
without the need for dataset-specific tuning.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully

curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多相机3D形状非刚性配准方法，通过广义相机模型处理多视角2D关键点，提高了变形形状的重建精度。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的单图像3D形状配准方法（SfT）在处理多相机系统时存在局限，多相机联合信息可以扩展在医学成像和手持相机等应用场景的范围。

Method: 提出了三种基于广义相机模型的SfT方法：1）已知3D点方向向量的对应关键点；2）未知3D点但已知局部参考系方向的对应关键点；3）结合轮廓信息的对应关键点。前两种使用凸规划求解，第三种是迭代优化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上验证了所提方法的准确性，展示了多视角约束信息对提高重建精度的有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首个解决广义相机SfT问题的方法集，通过多视角互约束信息显著提升了变形形状估计的精度。

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

Motivation: 城市树木生物多样性对气候韧性至关重要，但传统实地调查成本高昂，监督AI方法需要标注数据且跨区域泛化能力差。需要一种可扩展的无监督方法来支持城市生态管理。

Method: 无监督聚类框架，整合街景图像的视觉嵌入特征和空间种植模式，无需标注数据即可估计生物多样性。在8个北美城市进行验证。

Result: 方法能够高保真地恢复属级生物多样性模式，Shannon和Simpson指数的Wasserstein距离较低，保持了空间自相关性。

Conclusion: 该可扩展的细粒度方法为缺乏详细清单的城市提供了生物多样性映射途径，支持低成本连续监测和公平绿化管理。

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Result: 模型能够以5天间隔预测气溶胶指数，均方误差约0.0018，损失约0.3995，结构相似性指数约0.74，表现优于先前模型。

Conclusion: ConvLSTM模型在气溶胶指数预测方面有效，但可通过整合更多数据和优化架构进一步提升性能。

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: 利用轨迹先验约束可以有效拒绝重复环境中的错误闭环，提高SLAM系统的可靠性

Abstract: Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes,
achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely
detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive
environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.
Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false
positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly
focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge
of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,
we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the
historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in
challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used
to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory
is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the
trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to
determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify
its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are
available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.

Abstract: This systematic review critically evaluates publicly available abdominal CT
datasets and their suitability for artificial intelligence (AI) applications in
clinical settings. We examined 46 publicly available abdominal CT datasets
(50,256 studies). Across all 46 datasets, we found substantial redundancy
(59.1\% case reuse) and a Western/geographic skew (75.3\% from North America

cases; within this subset, the most prevalent high-risk categories were domain
shift (63\%) and selection bias (57\%), both of which may undermine model
generalizability across diverse healthcare environments -- particularly in
resource-limited settings. To address these challenges, we propose targeted
strategies for dataset improvement, including multi-institutional
collaboration, adoption of standardized protocols, and deliberate inclusion of
diverse patient populations and imaging technologies. These efforts are crucial
in supporting the development of more equitable and clinically robust AI models

Abstract: This paper uses multi-object tracking methods known from the radar tracking
community to address the problem of pedestrian tracking using 2D bounding box
detections. The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior
density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter.
The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed,
including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected
from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is,
in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting
PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and
the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the
problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better
model-based algorithms in future developments.

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range

models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a

Abstract: Cervical cancer is among the most commonly occurring cancer among women and
claims a huge number of lives in low and middle-income countries despite being
relatively easy to treat. Several studies have shown that public screening
programs can bring down cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates
significantly. While several screening tests are available, visual inspection
with acetic acid (VIA) presents itself as the most viable option for
low-resource settings due to the affordability and simplicity of performing the
test. VIA requires a trained medical professional to interpret the test and is
subjective in nature. Automating VIA using AI eliminates subjectivity and would
allow shifting of the task to less trained health workers. Task shifting with
AI would help further expedite screening programs in low-resource settings. In
our work, we propose a lightweight deep learning algorithm that includes
EfficientDet-Lite3 as the Region of Interest (ROI) detector and a MobileNet- V2
based model for classification. These models would be deployed on an
android-based device that can operate remotely and provide almost instant
results without the requirement of highly-trained medical professionals, labs,
sophisticated infrastructure, or internet connectivity. The classification
model gives an accuracy of 92.31%, a sensitivity of 98.24%, and a specificity

Abstract: Demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system may have multiple
causes, the most common are infections, autoimmune responses, genetic or
vascular etiology. Demyelination lesions are characterized by areas were the
myelin sheath of the nerve fibers are broken or destroyed. Among autoimmune
disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known Among these
disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known and aggressive form.
Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is another type of demyelinating
disease, typically with a better prognosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is
widely used for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression by detecting
lesions. While both adults and children can be affected, there is a significant
lack of publicly available datasets for pediatric cases and demyelinating
disorders beyond MS. This study introduces, for the first time, a publicly
available pediatric dataset for demyelinating lesion segmentation. The dataset
comprises MRI scans from 13 pediatric patients diagnosed with demyelinating
disorders, including 3 with ADEM. In addition to lesion segmentation masks, the
dataset includes extensive patient metadata, such as diagnosis, treatment,
personal medical background, and laboratory results. To assess the quality of
the dataset and demonstrate its relevance, we evaluate a state-of-the-art

Result: 实验结果表明该方法性能与topup相当，展示了其作为扩散MRI磁化率失真校正的高效实用替代方案的潜力

Conclusion: 该方法为单次采集的扩散MRI数据提供了有效的失真校正解决方案，扩展了传统方法的适用性

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a valuable tool to map brain microstructure and
connectivity by analyzing water molecule diffusion in tissue. However,
acquiring dMRI data requires to capture multiple 3D brain volumes in a short
time, often leading to trade-offs in image quality. One challenging artifact is
susceptibility-induced distortion, which introduces significant geometric and
intensity deformations. Traditional correction methods, such as topup, rely on
having access to blip-up and blip-down image pairs, limiting their
applicability to retrospective data acquired with a single phase encoding
direction. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach to correct
susceptibility distortions using only a single acquisition (either blip-up or
blip-down), eliminating the need for paired acquisitions. Experimental results
show that our method achieves performance comparable to topup, demonstrating
its potential as an efficient and practical alternative for susceptibility
distortion correction in dMRI.

Abstract: Accurate compensation of brain shift is critical for maintaining the
reliability of neuronavigation during neurosurgery. While keypoint-based
registration methods offer robustness to large deformations and topological
changes, they typically rely on simple geometric interpolators that ignore
tissue biomechanics to create dense displacement fields. In this work, we
propose a novel deep learning framework that estimates dense, physically
plausible brain deformations from sparse matched keypoints. We first generate a
large dataset of synthetic brain deformations using biomechanical simulations.
Then, a residual 3D U-Net is trained to refine standard interpolation estimates
into biomechanically guided deformations. Experiments on a large set of
simulated displacement fields demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms classical interpolators, reducing by half the mean square error
while introducing negligible computational overhead at inference time. Code

Conclusion: CoA范式为智能体模型和智能体RL研究提供了坚实基础，所有研究成果（模型权重、训练代码、训练数据）均已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

TL;DR: Cognitive Workspace是一种新的LLM上下文管理范式，模仿人类外部记忆的认知机制，通过主动记忆管理、分层认知缓冲和任务驱动的上下文优化，显著提高了记忆重用率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM虽然上下文窗口扩展到百万token，但被动检索系统无法模拟人类动态、任务驱动的记忆管理机制，缺乏元认知意识和主动规划能力。

Method: 基于认知科学理论（Baddeley工作记忆模型、Clark扩展心智理论等），提出三个核心创新：主动记忆管理、分层认知缓冲、任务驱动的上下文优化。

Result: 平均58.6%的记忆重用率（传统RAG为0%），净效率增益17-18%，统计显著（p < 0.001, Cohen's d > 23）。

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace代表了从信息检索到真正认知增强的根本性转变，为LLM系统提供了首个主动记忆优越性的定量证据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了搜索时污染（STC）问题，指基于搜索的LLM智能体在评估时可能从在线平台（如HuggingFace）直接获取测试问题和答案，而非通过真正推理，从而损害基准测试的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别数据污染问题在搜索型LLM智能体评估中的新形式，即测试数据在搜索过程中被泄露，导致智能体通过复制而非推理来回答问题，影响基准测试的完整性。

Method: 在三个常用能力基准（HLE、SimpleQA、GPQA）上测试搜索型智能体，分析其搜索日志，发现HuggingFace等平台上的评估数据集被检索到，智能体在推理链中明确承认发现问答对。通过阻断HuggingFace进行消融实验。

Result: 约3%的问题中，搜索型智能体直接从HuggingFace找到带标签的数据集；阻断HuggingFace后，受污染子集的准确率下降约15%；公开可访问的评估数据集可能不是STC的唯一来源。

Conclusion: 需要制定基准设计和结果报告的最佳实践来解决这种新型泄露问题，确保搜索型LLM智能体的可信评估。公开实验日志以方便审计评估结果。

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

Motivation: 随着生成模型在语言、视觉和视频领域处理更大输入，token级别的计算成本成为关键瓶颈。现有token选择方法大多是静态的、模态特定的或不兼容自回归生成，需要一种高效的动态token合并方案。

Method: 提出QuickMerge框架：1)基于注意力范数幅度动态选择重要token；2)使用基于熵的预算估计器确定token数量；3)引入轻量级transformer先验在合并后的token序列上进行训练，保持自回归兼容性。

Result: 在多模态领域评估显示，QuickMerge在计算-精度权衡方面取得一致改进，显著减少token数量同时匹配甚至超过学习型tokenizer和固定patch基线的性能。

Conclusion: QuickMerge通过语义显著性估计、灵活token预算和自回归对齐的组合，实现了使用更少token的准确生成，为大规模生成模型提供了高效的token计算解决方案。

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at

Method: 开发了三维评估框架：1)风险知识评估 2)执行轨迹风险识别 3)风险行为避免能力。基于发现的性能差距，开发了独立的风险验证器系统，包含抽象器将具体执行轨迹转换为抽象描述以提高风险识别效果。

Result: 评估显示：代理风险知识通过率>98%，但实际场景风险识别性能下降>23%，风险行为执行通过率<26%。风险验证器系统将风险行为执行减少了55.3%。

Conclusion: 单纯提升模型能力或推理计算无法解决安全问题，需要专门的安全机制。风险验证器方法能有效弥补认知-执行差距，显著提升代理安全性。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

Conclusion: EAG-RL展示了在临床预测任务中实际部署的潜力，通过专家注意力引导有效提升了LLM的内在推理能力

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been

Conclusion: 多模态结构化强化学习是突破监督微调性能瓶颈的有效方法，特别是在需要复杂视觉推理和结构化输出的任务中。结合文本和视觉反馈的多粒度奖励系统能够显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

three stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with CoT to instill reasoning;
(2) Offline sampling with a pass@N strategy and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to improve generation quality; and (3) Difficulty-based dynamic sampling
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to mitigate discriminative
hallucination. Additionally, post-CoT processing and a cumulative

Method: 提出CausalPlan两阶段框架：1）结构因果行动（SCA）模型从智能体轨迹学习因果图；2）使用因果图为LLM生成的行动提案分配因果分数并重新加权，或在需要时回退到因果基础替代方案。

Result: 在Overcooked-AI基准测试中，使用Gemma-7B、Llama-8B、Qwen-14B和Llama-70B等模型，CausalPlan持续减少无效行动并在AI-AI和人类-AI设置中改善协作，优于强化学习基线。

Conclusion: 因果驱动规划对于部署高效、可解释和可泛化的多智能体LLM系统具有重要价值，无需对LLM本身进行微调即可实现干预一致的行为约束。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

Motivation: 单一LLM在医疗决策中存在参数知识限制和静态训练语料的问题，无法有效整合临床信息，需要多LLM协作来提升性能

Method: 两阶段框架：1）基于公开语料构建LLM专家表进行动态选择；2）通过置信度融合和对抗验证进行多智能体协作

Result: 在MMLU-Pro-Health数据集上达到74.45%准确率，比GPT-4-0613提升2.69%，在三个公开MDM数据集上均优于现有方法

Conclusion: EMRC框架通过专家感知的智能体招募和协作机制，有效利用了不同LLM的专业能力，显著提升了医疗决策性能

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

Conclusion: 这项工作突显了LLM作为评判者应用在鲁棒性方面存在的严重风险，需要加强对抗提示注入攻击的防御机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong emergent
abilities in complex reasoning and zero-shot generalization, showing
unprecedented potential for LLM-as-a-judge applications in education, peer
review, and data quality evaluation. However, their robustness under prompt
injection attacks, where malicious instructions are embedded into the content
to manipulate outputs, remains a significant concern. In this work, we explore
a frustratingly simple yet effective attack setting to test whether LLMs can be
easily misled. Specifically, we evaluate LLMs on basic arithmetic questions
(e.g., "What is 3 + 2?") presented as either multiple-choice or true-false
judgment problems within PDF files, where hidden prompts are injected into the
file. Our results reveal that LLMs are indeed vulnerable to such hidden prompt
injection attacks, even in these trivial scenarios, highlighting serious
robustness risks for LLM-as-a-judge applications.

Motivation: LLM推理受限于内存带宽，特别是KV缓存的频繁访问导致数据移动瓶颈。虽然注意力稀疏性有所改善，但完整KV缓存仍需保持可访问性，持续对带宽和容量造成压力。现代AI硬件的高带宽内存(HBM)和高速DRAM为异构内存系统提供了实用解决方案。

Result: 揭示了运行时优化的巨大潜力空间，为动态KV缓存调度提供了首个形式化理论分析框架。

Conclusion: 异构内存系统中的动态KV缓存调度具有显著的性能优化空间，该研究为后续实际调度算法的开发奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is increasingly constrained by memory
bandwidth, with frequent access to the key-value (KV) cache dominating data
movement. While attention sparsity reduces some memory traffic, the relevance
of past tokens varies over time, requiring the full KV cache to remain
accessible and sustaining pressure on both bandwidth and capacity. With
advances in interconnects such as NVLink and LPDDR5X, modern AI hardware now
integrates high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with high-speed off-package DRAM, making
heterogeneous memory systems a practical solution. This work investigates
dynamic KV cache placement across such systems to maximize aggregated bandwidth
utilization under capacity constraints. Rather than proposing a specific
scheduling policy, we formulate the placement problem mathematically and derive
a theoretical upper bound, revealing substantial headroom for runtime
optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first formal treatment of dynamic
KV cache scheduling in heterogeneous memory systems for LLM inference.

Conclusion: LLM安全护栏存在严重脆弱性，需要重新评估其鲁棒性，推动未来更强的安全对齐研究

Abstract: In this study, we disclose a worrying new vulnerability in Large Language
Models (LLMs), which we term \textbf{involuntary jailbreak}. Unlike existing
jailbreak attacks, this weakness is distinct in that it does not involve a
specific attack objective, such as generating instructions for \textit{building
a bomb}. Prior attack methods predominantly target localized components of the
LLM guardrail. In contrast, involuntary jailbreaks may potentially compromise
the entire guardrail structure, which our method reveals to be surprisingly
fragile. We merely employ a single universal prompt to achieve this goal. In
particular, we instruct LLMs to generate several questions that would typically
be rejected, along with their corresponding in-depth responses (rather than a
refusal). Remarkably, this simple prompt strategy consistently jailbreaks the
majority of leading LLMs, including Claude Opus 4.1, Grok 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
and GPT 4.1. We hope this problem can motivate researchers and practitioners to
re-evaluate the robustness of LLM guardrails and contribute to stronger safety
alignment in future.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language

management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse

vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic
representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However,
existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely
on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich
textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of
LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous
knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase
optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item
correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns
an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling
semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is
optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and
computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three

Abstract: In particular, large-scale deep learning and artificial intelligence model
training uses a lot of computational power and energy, so it poses serious
sustainability issues. The fast rise in model complexity has resulted in
exponential increases in energy consumption, increasing the demand for
techniques maximizing computational efficiency and lowering environmental
impact. This work explores environmentally driven performance optimization
methods especially intended for advanced GPU architectures from NVIDIA, AMD,
and other emerging GPU architectures. Our main focus is on investigating
hardware-software co-design techniques meant to significantly increase
memory-level and kernel-level operations, so improving performance-per-watt
measures. Our thorough research encompasses evaluations of specialized tensor
and matrix cores, advanced memory optimization methods, and creative
integration approaches that taken together result in notable energy efficiency
increases. We also discuss important software-level optimizations that augment
hardware capability including mixed-precision arithmetic, advanced energy-aware
scheduling algorithms, and compiler-driven kernel enhancements. Moreover, we
methodically point out important research gaps and suggest future directions
necessary to create really sustainable artificial intelligence systems. This
paper emphasizes how major increases in training efficiency can be obtained by
co-design of hardware and software, so lowering the environmental impact of
artificial intelligence without compromising performance. To back up our
analysis, we use real-world case studies from top companies like Meta, Google,
Amazon, and others that show how these sustainable AI training methods are used
in the real world.

Conclusion: LLM生成元数据的方法可以有效解决科学摘要自动分类的挑战，为战略决策提供可靠支持

Abstract: Classification of scientific abstracts is useful for strategic activities but
challenging to automate because the sparse text provides few contextual clues.
Metadata associated with the scientific publication can be used to improve
performance but still often requires a semi-supervised setting. Moreover, such
schemes may generate labels that lack distinction -- namely, they overlap and
thus do not uniquely define the abstract. In contrast, experts label and sort
these texts with ease. Here we describe an application of a process we call
artificial intuition to replicate the expert's approach, using a Large Language
Model (LLM) to generate metadata. We use publicly available abstracts from the
United States National Science Foundation to create a set of labels, and then
we test this on a set of abstracts from the Chinese National Natural Science
Foundation to examine funding trends. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
method for research portfolio management, technology scouting, and other
strategic activities.

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the

interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing

filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and

Method: 提出基于网络的棋子互动指标来量化棋盘上的战略张力，分析不同Elo等级人类棋手和不同复杂度AI算法的对局数据。

Result: 顶级AI玩家比精英人类玩家能维持更高水平的战略张力更长时间；人类游戏中的累积张力在约1600Elo和2300Elo时出现显著跃升；AI容忍攻防平衡的互联局面，而人类限制张力和游戏复杂度。

Conclusion: AI和人类在战略决策上存在根本性差异，AI能够处理更复杂的战略环境，这种差异对AI在复杂战略环境中的应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

Conclusion: DIVE工作流和智能体设计可广泛适用于不同材料，为AI驱动的材料发现提供了新范式

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

Conclusion: 该框架通过将瞬时发现转化为持久知识库，使LLM能够从自身经验中学习，为自动启发式设计提供了有效的知识积累机制

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

Method: SPANER采用共享提示机制作为概念锚点，使语义相关的实例在空间中汇聚，无论其模态如何。该设计支持无缝集成额外模态（如音频）而无需改变核心架构。

Result: 在视觉-语言和音频-视觉基准测试中，SPANER展示了具有竞争力的少样本检索性能，同时在学习的嵌入空间中保持了高语义一致性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了调整嵌入空间结构（而不仅仅是调整适配器权重）对于可扩展多模态学习的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent
implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

Conclusion: ITL-LIME框架有效解决了数据稀缺环境下LIME方法的局限性，为黑盒模型解释提供了更可靠的方法

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

Conclusion: 通过结合LLM推理与科学电路设计方法，验证了真正模拟设计自动化的可行路径。gm/Id数据对于效率和精度至关重要。

Abstract: Analog IC design is a bottleneck due to its reliance on experience and
inefficient simulations, as traditional formulas fail in advanced nodes.
Applying Large Language Models (LLMs) directly to this problem risks mere
"guessing" without engineering principles. We present a "synergistic reasoning"
framework that integrates an LLM's strategic reasoning with the physical
precision of the gm/Id methodology. By empowering the LLM with gm/Id lookup
tables, it becomes a quantitative, data-driven design partner.
  We validated this on a two-stage op-amp, where our framework enabled the
Gemini model to meet all TT corner specs in 5 iterations and extended
optimization to all PVT corners. A crucial ablation study proved gm/Id data is
key for this efficiency and precision; without it, the LLM is slower and
deviates. Compared to a senior engineer's design, our framework achieves
quasi-expert quality with an order-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. This
work validates a path for true analog design automation by combining LLM
reasoning with scientific circuit design methodologies.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

Abstract: Homelessness is a persistent social challenge, impacting millions worldwide.
Over 770,000 people experienced homelessness in the U.S. in 2024. Social
stigmatization is a significant barrier to alleviation, shifting public
perception, and influencing policymaking. Given that online and city council
discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable
insights to identify and track social biases. This research contributes to
alleviating homelessness by acting on public opinion. It introduces novel
methods, building on natural language processing (NLP) and large language
models (LLMs), to identify and measure PEH social bias expressed in digital
spaces. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-modal dataset compiled from
Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes
across 10 U.S. cities. This unique dataset provides evidence of the typologies
of homelessness bias described in the literature. In order to scale up and
automate the detection of homelessness bias online, we evaluate LLMs as
classifiers. We applied both zero-shot and few-shot classification techniques
to this data. We utilized local LLMs (Llama 3.2 3B Instruct, Qwen 2.5 7B
Instruct, and Phi4 Instruct Mini) as well as closed-source API models (GPT-4.1,
Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok-4). Our findings reveal that although there are
significant inconsistencies in local LLM zero-shot classification, the
in-context learning classification scores of local LLMs approach the
classification scores of closed-source LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs outperform BERT
when averaging across all categories. This work aims to raise awareness about
the pervasive bias against PEH, develop new indicators to inform policy, and
ultimately enhance the fairness and ethical application of Generative AI
technologies.

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

error-prone process of hardware design.
  However, existing approaches predominantly rely on human intervention and
fine-tuning using curated datasets, limiting their scalability in automated
design workflows.
  Although recent iterative search techniques have emerged, they often fail to
explore diverse design solutions and may underperform simpler approaches such
as repeated prompting.
  To address these limitations, we introduce EvoVerilog, a novel framework that
combines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to
automatically generate and refine Verilog code.
  EvoVerilog utilizes a multiobjective, population-based search strategy to
explore a wide range of design possibilities without requiring human
intervention.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that EvoVerilog achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with pass@10 scores of 89.1 and 80.2 on the VerilogEval-Machine
and VerilogEval-Human benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, the framework
showcases its ability to explore diverse designs by simultaneously generating a
variety of functional Verilog code while optimizing resource utilization.

Abstract: The surge in multimodal single-cell omics data exposes limitations in
traditional, manually defined analysis workflows. AI agents offer a paradigm
shift, enabling adaptive planning, executable code generation, traceable
decisions, and real-time knowledge fusion. However, the lack of a comprehensive
benchmark critically hinders progress. We introduce a novel benchmarking
evaluation system to rigorously assess agent capabilities in single-cell omics
analysis. This system comprises: a unified platform compatible with diverse
agent frameworks and LLMs; multidimensional metrics assessing cognitive program
synthesis, collaboration, execution efficiency, bioinformatics knowledge
integration, and task completion quality; and 50 diverse real-world single-cell
omics analysis tasks spanning multi-omics, species, and sequencing
technologies. Our evaluation reveals that Grok-3-beta achieves state-of-the-art
performance among tested agent frameworks. Multi-agent frameworks significantly
enhance collaboration and execution efficiency over single-agent approaches
through specialized role division. Attribution analyses of agent capabilities
identify that high-quality code generation is crucial for task success, and
self-reflection has the most significant overall impact, followed by
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and planning. This work highlights
persistent challenges in code generation, long-context handling, and
context-aware knowledge retrieval, providing a critical empirical foundation
and best practices for developing robust AI agents in computational biology.

Motivation: 现有对话推荐系统大多忽略了用户的异质性决策风格和知识水平，这限制了推荐的准确性和效率。

Method: 基于消费者类型理论定义四类用户，使用LLM实时推断用户类型，设计类型自适应策略，并采用逆强化学习优化对话策略。

Result: 在LastFM、Amazon-Book和Yelp数据集上，CT-CRS相比基线方法提高了推荐成功率并减少了交互轮次。

Conclusion: CT-CRS通过整合心理建模和高级策略优化，为增强CRS个性化提供了可扩展和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) provide personalized services
through multi-turn interactions, yet most existing methods overlook users'
heterogeneous decision-making styles and knowledge levels, which constrains
both accuracy and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer
Type-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates
consumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type
theory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and
expert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs.
satisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction
histories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user
types in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate
user types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that
dynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query
complexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like
strategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book,
and Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces
interaction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
both consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance
gains. These results demonstrate that CT-CRS offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for enhancing CRS personalization through the
integration of psychological modeling and advanced policy optimization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a universal, open standard
for connecting AI agents with data sources and external tools. While MCP
enhances the capabilities of LLM-based agents, it also introduces new security
risks and expands their attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first
systematic taxonomy of MCP security, identifying 17 attack types across 4
primary attack surfaces. We introduce MCPSecBench, a comprehensive security
benchmark and playground that integrates prompt datasets, MCP servers, MCP
clients, and attack scripts to evaluate these attacks across three major MCP
providers. Our benchmark is modular and extensible, allowing researchers to
incorporate custom implementations of clients, servers, and transport protocols
for systematic security assessment. Experimental results show that over 85% of
the identified attacks successfully compromise at least one platform, with core
vulnerabilities universally affecting Claude, OpenAI, and Cursor, while
prompt-based and tool-centric attacks exhibit considerable variability across
different hosts and models. Overall, MCPSecBench standardizes the evaluation of
MCP security and enables rigorous testing across all MCP layers.

Abstract: In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single
list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused
services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems
(CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic
systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However,
agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge
for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between
handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the
first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent
to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a
user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency.
For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool
for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing
module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to
the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks
using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world
career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average
response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while
significantly improving recommendation accuracy.

Abstract: Understanding and quantifying human cognitive biases from empirical data has
long posed a formidable challenge, particularly in cybersecurity, where
defending against unknown adversaries is paramount. Traditional cyber defense
strategies have largely focused on fortification, while some approaches attempt
to anticipate attacker strategies by mapping them to cognitive vulnerabilities,
yet they fall short in dynamically interpreting attacks in progress. In
recognition of this gap, IARPA's ReSCIND program seeks to infer, defend
against, and even exploit attacker cognitive traits. In this paper, we present
a novel methodology that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract
quantifiable insights into the cognitive bias of loss aversion from hacker
behavior. Our data are collected from an experiment in which hackers were
recruited to attack a controlled demonstration network. We process the hacker
generated notes using LLMs using it to segment the various actions and
correlate the actions to predefined persistence mechanisms used by hackers. By
correlating the implementation of these mechanisms with various operational
triggers, our analysis provides new insights into how loss aversion manifests
in hacker decision-making. The results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively
dissect and interpret nuanced behavioral patterns, thereby offering a
transformative approach to enhancing cyber defense strategies through
real-time, behavior-based analysis.

Conclusion: AlphaEval解决了alpha挖掘系统评估的关键挑战，提供了一个高效、全面的评估框架，并开源促进可复现性和社区发展。

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

Conclusion: DMMV作为一个上下文无关的优化问题具有广泛适用性，提出的GPU加速启发式算法在多个不同问题上都表现出优势。

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs are used for various purposes, including business
applications, biomedical analyses, or digital twins in industry 4.0. In this
paper, we investigate knowledge graphs describing household actions, which are
beneficial for controlling household robots and analyzing video footage. In the
latter case, the information extracted from videos is notoriously incomplete,
and completing the knowledge graph for enhancing the situational picture is
essential. In this paper, we show that, while a standard link prediction
problem, situational knowledge graphs have special characteristics that render
many link prediction algorithms not fit for the job, and unable to outperform
even simple baselines.

Conclusion: 该工作有效解决了复杂电路图到网表的转换问题，为LLM在模拟集成电路设计中的应用提供了重要数据支持和技术基础。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) exhibits great potential in designing of analog
integrated circuits (IC) because of its excellence in abstraction and
generalization for knowledge. However, further development of LLM-based analog
ICs heavily relies on textual description of analog ICs, while existing analog
ICs are mostly illustrated in image-based circuit diagrams rather than
text-based netlists. Converting circuit diagrams to netlists help LLMs to
enrich the knowledge of analog IC. Nevertheless, previously proposed conversion
frameworks face challenges in further application because of limited support of
image styles and circuit elements. Up to now, it still remains a challenging
task to effectively convert complex circuit diagrams into netlists. To this
end, this paper constructs and opensources a new dataset with rich styles of
circuit diagrams as well as balanced distribution of simple and complex analog
ICs. And a hybrid framework, named Image2Net, is proposed for practical
conversion from circuit diagrams to netlists. The netlist edit distance (NED)
is also introduced to precisely assess the difference between the converted
netlists and ground truth. Based on our benchmark, Image2Net achieves 80.77\%
successful rate, which is 34.62\%-45.19\% higher than previous works.
Specifically, the proposed work shows 0.116 averaged NED, which is
62.1\%-69.6\% lower than state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Advances in generative artificial intelligence are transforming how
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are designed and discovered. This Perspective
introduces the shift from laborious enumeration of MOF candidates to generative
approaches that can autonomously propose and synthesize in the laboratory new
porous reticular structures on demand. We outline the progress of employing
deep learning models, such as variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and
large language model-based agents, that are fueled by the growing amount of
available data from the MOF community and suggest novel crystalline materials
designs. These generative tools can be combined with high-throughput
computational screening and even automated experiments to form accelerated,
closed-loop discovery pipelines. The result is a new paradigm for reticular
chemistry in which AI algorithms more efficiently direct the search for
high-performance MOF materials for clean air and energy applications. Finally,
we highlight remaining challenges such as synthetic feasibility, dataset
diversity, and the need for further integration of domain knowledge.

Abstract: The acceleration of artificial intelligence (AI) in science is recognized and
many scholars have begun to explore its role in interdisciplinary
collaboration. However, the mechanisms and extent of this impact are still
unclear. This study, using AlphaFold's impact on structural biologists,
examines how AI technologies influence interdisciplinary collaborative
patterns. By analyzing 1,247 AlphaFold-related papers and 7,700 authors from
Scopus, we employ bibliometric analysis and causal inference to compare
interdisciplinary collaboration between AlphaFold adopters and non-adopters.
Contrary to the widespread belief that AI facilitates interdisciplinary
collaboration, our findings show that AlphaFold increased structural
biology-computer science collaborations by just 0.48%, with no measurable
effect on other disciplines. Specifically, AI creates interdisciplinary
collaboration demands with specific disciplines due to its technical
characteristics, but this demand is weakened by technological democratization
and other factors. These findings demonstrate that artificial intelligence (AI)
alone has limited efficacy in bridging disciplinary divides or fostering
meaningful interdisciplinary collaboration.

Method: 通过分析行为方法（基于行为观察）和机制方法（基于内部状态探测）的假设和问题，识别形式化目标概念的技术和概念困难。

Result: 发现目标导向性无法被客观测量，因为目标定义本身依赖于观察者的解释框架和背景假设。

Conclusion: 提出将目标导向性视为动态多智能体系统涌现属性的新建模方向，而非固有可测量的个体属性。

Abstract: Our ability to predict the behavior of complex agents turns on the
attribution of goals. Probing for goal-directed behavior comes in two flavors:
Behavioral and mechanistic. The former proposes that goal-directedness can be
estimated through behavioral observation, whereas the latter attempts to probe
for goals in internal model states. We work through the assumptions behind both
approaches, identifying technical and conceptual problems that arise from
formalizing goals in agent systems. We arrive at the perhaps surprising
position that goal-directedness cannot be measured objectively. We outline new
directions for modeling goal-directedness as an emergent property of dynamic,
multi-agent systems.

Abstract: In modern Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuit design flow, the
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) stage presents a critical opportunity for timing
optimization. Addressing timing violations at this early stage is essential, as
modern systems demand higher speeds, where even minor timing violations can
lead to functional failures or system crashes. However, traditional timing
optimization heavily relies on manual expertise, requiring engineers to
iteratively analyze timing reports and debug. To automate this process, this
paper proposes ViTAD, a method that efficiently analyzes the root causes of
timing violations and dynamically generates targeted repair strategies.
Specifically, we first parse Verilog code and timing reports to construct a
Signal Timing Dependency Graph (STDG). Based on the STDG, we perform violation
path analysis and use large language models (LLMs) to infer the root causes of
violations. Finally, by analyzing the causes of violations, we selectively
retrieve relevant debugging knowledge from a domain-specific knowledge base to
generate customized repair solutions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
method, we construct a timing violation dataset based on real-world open-source
projects. This dataset contains 54 cases of violations. Experimental results
show that our method achieves a 73.68% success rate in repairing timing
violations, while the baseline using only LLM is 54.38%. Our method improves
the success rate by 19.30%.

Abstract: Autonomous trading strategies have been a subject of research within the
field of artificial intelligence (AI) for aconsiderable period. Various AI
techniques have been explored to develop autonomous agents capable of trading
financial assets. These approaches encompass traditional methods such as neural
networks, fuzzy logic, and reinforcement learning, as well as more recent
advancements, including deep neural networks and deep reinforcement learning.
Many developers report success in creating strategies that exhibit strong
performance during simulations using historical price data, a process commonly
referred to as backtesting. However, when these strategies are deployed in real
markets, their performance often deteriorates, particularly in terms of
risk-adjusted returns. In this study, we propose an AI-based strategy inspired
by a classical investment paradigm: Value Investing. Financial AI models are
highly susceptible to lookahead bias and other forms of bias that can
significantly inflate performance in backtesting compared to live trading
conditions. To address this issue, we conducted a series of computational
simulations while controlling for these biases, thereby reducing the risk of
overfitting. Our results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms major
Brazilian market benchmarks. Moreover, the strategy, named AlphaX, demonstrated
superior performance relative to widely used technical indicators such as the
Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI), with statistically
significant results. Finally, we discuss several open challenges and highlight
emerging technologies in qualitative analysis that may contribute to the

Abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach to
teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning.
While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a
task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for
functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of
generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level
correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among
functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To
address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes
functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local
coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating
tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively
enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to
manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore,
leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated
rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects. Our code and

Conclusion: V2P方法能有效隔离目标区域并让模型专注于UI元素的最关键点，对精确GUI定位任务具有良好泛化性。

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a

Abstract: User recommendation systems enhance user engagement by encouraging users to
act as inviters to interact with other users (invitees), potentially fostering
information propagation. Conventional recommendation methods typically focus on
modeling interaction willingness. Influence-Maximization (IM) methods focus on
identifying a set of users to maximize the information propagation. However,
existing methods face two significant challenges. First, recommendation methods
fail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to
account for the willingness to interact. To solve these issues, we propose two
models named HeteroIR and HeteroIM. HeteroIR provides an intuitive solution to
unleash the dissemination potential of user recommendation systems. HeteroIM
fills the gap between the IM method and the recommendation task, improving
interaction willingness and maximizing spread coverage. The HeteroIR introduces
a two-stage framework to estimate the spread profits. The HeteroIM
incrementally selects the most influential invitee to recommend and rerank
based on the number of reverse reachable (RR) sets containing inviters and
invitees. RR set denotes a set of nodes that can reach a target via
propagation. Extensive experiments show that HeteroIR and HeteroIM
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the p-value <
0.05. Furthermore, we have deployed HeteroIR and HeteroIM in Tencent's online
gaming platforms and gained an 8.5\% and 10\% improvement in the online A/B

Conclusion: MHSNet能够有效解决简历去重问题，提升人才库质量。

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts

Method: 使用描述逻辑EL和ELI以及多种TGD类型（包括full、guarded、frontier-guarded、frontier-one等）作为本体和约束语言，设计算法来拟合给定的正负示例。

Result: 精确确定了计算复杂度，设计了有效的拟合算法，并分析了拟合结果的大小。发现对于某些TGD类型（如full、frontier-guarded和frontier-one TGDs）不存在有限基。

Conclusion: 该研究为从示例中学习本体和约束提供了理论基础和实用算法，但某些类型的TGD无法形成有限基，这限制了其应用范围。

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo

instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,
conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This
paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

Motivation: 传统floorplanner在现代约束条件下往往忽略引脚分配，而引脚分配对后续详细布局和布线阶段性能有重要影响

Method: 构建基于模块几何关系和网表连接的图，迭代搜索最短路径确定引脚分配，采用空白空间移除策略和三个局部优化器

Result: 在基准电路上平均减少6.81%的HPWL、13.39%的feedthrough线长、16.36%的feedthrough模块数量和21.21%的未放置引脚，同时保持零空白空间

Conclusion: Piano框架有效解决了现代VLSI floorplanning中的多约束优化问题，显著提升了布局质量

Abstract: Floorplanning is a critical step in VLSI physical design, increasingly
complicated by modern constraints such as fixed-outline requirements,
whitespace removal, and the presence of pre-placed modules. In addition, the
assignment of pins on module boundaries significantly impacts the performance
of subsequent stages, including detailed placement and routing. However,
traditional floorplanners often overlook pin assignment with modern constraints
during the floorplanning stage. In this work, we introduce Piano, a
floorplanning framework that simultaneously optimizes module placement and pin
assignment under multiple constraints. Specifically, we construct a graph based
on the geometric relationships among modules and their netlist connections,
then iteratively search for shortest paths to determine pin assignments. This
graph-based method also enables accurate evaluation of feedthrough and unplaced
pins, thereby guiding overall layout quality. To further improve the design, we
adopt a whitespace removal strategy and employ three local optimizers to
enhance layout metrics under multi-constraint scenarios. Experimental results
on widely used benchmark circuits demonstrate that Piano achieves an average
6.81% reduction in HPWL, a 13.39% decrease in feedthrough wirelength, a 16.36%
reduction in the number of feedthrough modules, and a 21.21% drop in unplaced
pins, while maintaining zero whitespace.

Abstract: High-fidelity personalized human musculoskeletal models are crucial for
simulating realistic behavior of physically coupled human-robot interactive
systems and verifying their safety-critical applications in simulations before
actual deployment, such as human-robot co-transportation and rehabilitation
through robotic exoskeletons. Identifying subject-specific Hill-type muscle
model parameters and bone dynamic parameters is essential for a personalized
musculoskeletal model, but very challenging due to the difficulty of measuring
the internal biomechanical variables in vivo directly, especially the joint
torques. In this paper, we propose using Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model
(Diff-MSM) to simultaneously identify its muscle and bone parameters with an
end-to-end automatic differentiation technique differentiating from the
measurable muscle activation, through the joint torque, to the resulting
observable motion without the need to measure the internal joint torques.
Through extensive comparative simulations, the results manifested that our
proposed method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art baseline
methods, especially in terms of accurate estimation of the muscle parameters
(i.e., initial guess sampled from a normal distribution with the mean being the
ground truth and the standard deviation being 10% of the ground truth could end
up with an average of the percentage errors of the estimated values as low as
0.05%). In addition to human musculoskeletal modeling and simulation, the new
parameter identification technique with the Diff-MSM has great potential to
enable new applications in muscle health monitoring, rehabilitation, and sports
science.

detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice
interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual
translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read
back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual

interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates
them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf

Abstract: Consumer agency in the digital age is increasingly constrained by systemic
barriers and algorithmic manipulation, raising concerns about the authenticity
of consumption choices. Nowadays, financial decisions are shaped by external
pressures like obligatory consumption, algorithmic persuasion, and unstable
work schedules that erode financial autonomy. Obligatory consumption (like
hidden fees) is intensified by digital ecosystems. Algorithmic tactics like
personalized recommendations lead to impulsive purchases. Unstable work
schedules also undermine financial planning. Thus, it is important to study how
these factors impact consumption agency. To do so, we examine formal models
grounded in discounted consumption with constraints that bound agency. We
construct analytical scenarios in which consumers face obligatory payments,
algorithm-influenced impulsive expenses, or unpredictable income due to
temporal instability. Using this framework, we demonstrate that even rational,
utility-maximizing agents can experience early financial ruin when agency is
limited across structural, behavioral, or temporal dimensions and how
diminished autonomy impacts long-term financial well-being. Our central
argument is that consumer agency must be treated as a value (not a given)
requiring active cultivation, especially in digital ecosystems. The connection
between our formal modeling and this argument allows us to indicate that
limitations on agency (whether structural, behavioral, or temporal) can be
rigorously linked to measurable risks like financial instability. This
connection is also a basis for normative claims about consumption as a value,
by anchoring them in a formally grounded analysis of consumer behavior. As
solutions, we study systemic interventions and consumer education to support
value deliberation and informed choices. We formally demonstrate how these
measures strengthen agency.

Abstract: The cochlear implant (CI) is a remarkable biomedical device that successfully
enables individuals with severe-to-profound hearing loss to perceive sound by
converting speech into electrical stimulation signals. Despite advancements in
the performance of recent CI systems, speech comprehension in noisy or
reverberant conditions remains a challenge. Recent and ongoing developments in
deep learning reveal promising opportunities for enhancing CI sound coding
capabilities, not only through replicating traditional signal processing
methods with neural networks, but also through integrating visual cues as
auxiliary data for multimodal speech processing. Therefore, this paper
introduces a novel noise-suppressing CI system, AVSE-ECS, which utilizes an
audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) model as a pre-processing module for the
deep-learning-based ElectrodeNet-CS (ECS) sound coding strategy. Specifically,
a joint training approach is applied to model AVSE-ECS, an end-to-end CI
system. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the
previous ECS strategy in noisy conditions, with improved objective speech
intelligibility scores. The methods and findings in this study demonstrate the
feasibility and potential of using deep learning to integrate the AVSE module

Abstract: Origami-inspired structures provide unprecedented opportunities for creating
lightweight, deployable systems with programmable mechanical responses.
However, their design remains challenging due to complex nonlinear mechanics,
multistability, and the need for precise control of deployment forces. Here, we
present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for both forward
prediction and inverse design of conical Kresling origami (CKO) without
requiring pre-collected training data. By embedding mechanical equilibrium
equations directly into the learning process, the model predicts complete
energy landscapes with high accuracy while minimizing non-physical artifacts.
The inverse design routine specifies both target stable-state heights and
separating energy barriers, enabling freeform programming of the entire energy
curve. This capability is extended to hierarchical CKO assemblies, where
sequential layer-by-layer deployment is achieved through programmed barrier
magnitudes. Finite element simulations and experiments on physical prototypes
validate the designed deployment sequences and barrier ratios, confirming the
robustness of the approach. This work establishes a versatile, data-free route
for programming complex mechanical energy landscapes in origami-inspired
metamaterials, offering broad potential for deployable aerospace systems,
morphing structures, and soft robotic actuators.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

Conclusion: 挑战了"垃圾进垃圾出"的传统观念，发现看似低质量的数据集也能获得高性能，简单的数据集规模缩放需要谨慎评估，小样本集足以激发高级推理能力。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale
carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in
test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling
paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting
resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine
meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also
find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query
strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on
training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also
surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high
performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting
examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These
findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".
Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit
the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar
quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be
carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the
Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level
reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and
AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with
a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,
the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate
reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our
datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

TL;DR: RISE是一个两阶段框架，通过强化学习生成视觉基础、逻辑一致的思维链(CoTs)，然后利用高质量CoT子集进行监督微调和强化微调，提升VLM在复杂图像标注任务中的推理能力和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在复杂图像标注任务中表现不佳，标准监督微调只关注标注结果而忽略推理过程，视觉强化微调由于缺乏高质量验证的思维链而产生不一致的推理。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) RISE-CoT阶段：通过强化学习驱动的"标注-推理-标注"闭环生成视觉基础、逻辑一致的思维链；2) RISE-R1阶段：利用高质量CoT子集进行监督微调，然后进行强化微调。

Result: 在复杂和简单图像标注任务上，RISE训练的Qwen2-VL-2B模型优于SFT和Visual-RFT，实现了鲁棒性能和增强的可解释性。

Conclusion: RISE提供了一个无需人工标注思维链的自监督解决方案，可显著提升VLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

Conclusion: X-MoE系统有效解决了MoE架构在非NVIDIA平台上的可扩展性问题，为下一代MoE模型的训练提供了高效的跨平台解决方案

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as
DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert
segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by
substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.
Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant
computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE
training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for
next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel
techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform
kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with
sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,
powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to
545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable
model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining
high training throughput. The source code of X-MoE is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要为每个目标或偏好配置微调模型，计算成本高且不灵活。需要一种轻量级方法在推理时动态控制LLM行为，实现多目标平衡。

Method: 训练一组小型价值模型对应不同目标，推理时根据用户指定权重组合这些模型产生倾斜函数，调整基础模型的输出分布。使用迭代算法确保KL正则化策略的单调改进。

Result: MAVIS在性能上优于为每个目标微调模型并事后组合的基线方法，甚至接近为用户精确偏好微调的理想化设置性能。

Conclusion: MAVIS提供了一种计算高效且灵活的多目标对齐方法，无需昂贵的微调即可实现动态行为控制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives --
such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific
preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning
models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally
expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via
Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment
framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the
base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each
corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models
are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that
adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The
value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures
monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that
MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine
them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting
where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习需要统一模型架构和多轮通信，忽视了资源异构性，增加了客户端计算负担和通信开销。移动网络中客户端拥有宝贵私有数据但计算资源有限，且隐私约束阻止原始数据共享。

Method: FedOL采用知识蒸馏方法，客户端仅在未标记公共数据集上交换模型预测输出而非完整模型权重。引入专门的目标函数迭代优化伪标签和服务器模型，结合定制化的伪标签生成和知识蒸馏策略整合多样化知识。

Conclusion: FedOL通过单轮通信实现异构模型架构的联邦学习，有效降低了通信开销并支持模型定制化，在保护隐私的同时充分利用了客户端私有数据。

Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even
without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample
computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy
constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated
Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared
model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it
requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which
neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,
and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose
FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot
settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter
sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange
model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces
communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full
model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model
architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may
be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth
labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate
these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that
iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning
reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label
generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates
diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms
existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks
where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational
resources.

Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在两个未被充分探索的维度：深度（模型能采样的最难问题）和广度（单次迭代消耗的实例数量）。研究发现GRPO算法存在系统性偏差，过度加权中等准确率样本而忽视对推动推理边界至关重要的低准确率样本。

Conclusion: 广度和跨深度的自适应探索是RLVR中的正交维度，是释放RLVR推理能力的关键。DARS和DARS-B方法有效解决了深度和广度问题，为RLVR提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language
models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions:
Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances
consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and
reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights
samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances
that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth
neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which
re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby
increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,
naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts
Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra
inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of
exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training
data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch
size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over
multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.
Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued
exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which
augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K
and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across
depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the
reasoning power of RLVR.

Conclusion: 提出的框架为AI训练数据集的可信度评估提供了首个形式化方法，特别适用于偏见等全局属性的不确定性感知评估

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset
trustworthiness has become critical, particularly for properties like fairness
or bias that emerge at the dataset level. Prior work has used Subjective Logic
to assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate
trustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a
whole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the
trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations
of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach
supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where
evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this
framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally
evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results
demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable
and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.

Conclusion: OFQL成功解决了DQL的多步采样限制，提供了更高效、更鲁棒的离线强化学习解决方案，实现了单步动作生成而不损失性能。

Abstract: The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled
high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning
(RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among
them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its
consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice
due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both
training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply
applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we
revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow
Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action
generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary
models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates
DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While
conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step
generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates
direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for
multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster
and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL
benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based
baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time
compared to DQL.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential
settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when
the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert
demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both
together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale.
We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational
partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable.
Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated
Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a
broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn
reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited
amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD
outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use
LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a
single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.

GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy

providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.

Conclusion: 分类分布是连续控制中结构化探索和多模态行为表示的强大工具。

Abstract: A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or
stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone,
limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many
practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates
robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges
arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic
adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control
domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted
optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling
process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical
Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical
distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the
sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable
discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based
optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the
behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining
fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy
on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through
better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform
standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical
distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and
multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on
social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where
understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management.
Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately,
our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing,
leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to
extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively
model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism
within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this
mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the
model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.
The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused
features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.
Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social
media data into informative and noninformative categories across various
natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and
5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal
data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into
the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to
real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize
the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal
analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work
presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis
management solutions. Keywords:

Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient
exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$
possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have
been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations,
Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have
emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules.
However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language
modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies,
model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this
work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing
NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5
billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical
analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured
during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important
distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen
establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior
Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and
goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation
for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.

Conclusion: 研究为从业者根据目标和约束条件选择剪枝策略提供了有价值的见解，混合方法在某些场景下可以超越传统方法

Abstract: Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve
computational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways:
one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and
iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for
potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has
historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather
than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and
comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,
benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying
different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has
specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning
ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on
these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid
approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,
providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy
tailored to their goals and constraints. Source code is available at

Motivation: 联邦学习容易受到模型投毒攻击，传统联邦遗忘假设客户端可信且合作，但在恶意客户端可能共谋的场景下应用联邦遗忘具有挑战性。

Method: 基于最后一轮训练中客户端权重的差异，选择并置零良性客户端和恶意客户端更新之间差异最大的高幅值权重，同时保留良性信息。

Conclusion: FedUP在对抗性威胁模型下表现出高效性、鲁棒性和存储效率，相比现有最优解决方案更快且节省存储。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model
poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the
global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address
such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected
malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.
However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,
applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging
because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This
work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently
mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within
the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on
clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify
which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due
to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this
by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge
the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while
preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial
threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full
knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,
robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and
Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it
with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces
malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a
model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP
achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving
storage compared to the SOTA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU支持大批次训练（数万个样本），但现有优化器在大批次下效果不佳。一阶方法因梯度噪声减少而难以逃离次优最小值，二阶方法如KFAC需要过高阻尼而失去曲率信息优势。

Method: FOP利用两个子批次的梯度，在Fisher度量下构建与平均梯度正交的梯度差分量，增强平均梯度，形成方差感知的更新方向。

Result: FOP恢复了大批次下二阶方法的有效性，实现了可扩展训练，具有更好的泛化能力和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: FOP技术成功解决了大批次训练中的优化挑战，使二阶方法在大规模训练中保持优势。

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,
enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of
training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform
effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise
decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of
first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global
minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with
Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high
damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively
washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage,
reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper,
we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that
restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch
sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster
convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging
gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component
of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the
Fisher-metric.

Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when
using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better

unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine
these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper
establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods,
revealing through extensive experiments that well-performing scalarization
weights exhibit specific trends in key MTO metrics, such as high gradient
magnitude similarity. Building on this insight, we introduce AutoScale, a

weight selection for linear scalarization, without expensive weight search.
AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across

Result: 尽管方法简单，但在极端W1A1设置下仍能达到有竞争力的准确率，同时保持了STE的效率优势。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的低比特量化解决方案，在保持训练效率的同时实现了优异的量化性能。

Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where
rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the
floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity
dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization
bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization
problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator
(STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a
target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty
in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample
coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction
set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high
probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP
treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as
semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper
presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that
incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of
prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose
solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the
hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial
nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured
subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding
optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of
audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a
user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat
prediction sets.

Conclusion: EventTSF成功解决了多模态时间序列预测中的关键挑战，为融合文本事件和时间序列数据提供了有效的框架。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy
and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with
events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural
language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains
largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,
resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling
fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is
challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained
synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous
time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual
semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and
multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges
by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),
an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series
with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses
autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced
temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching
timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The
underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that
efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.
Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF
outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series
forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher
forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

Motivation: 解决AI系统不透明性带来的伦理问题，区分技术复杂性和商业隐藏两种不透明性类型，为开发更透明可信的AI系统提供理论基础

Method: 理论分析框架，分为两部分：1）分析两种不透明性类型及其伦理含义；2）评估现有可解释AI方法的局限性和挑战

Result: 识别了技术复杂性导致的内在不可访问性和商业隐藏造成的故意不透明性，指出XAI方法仍面临解释质量、可信度和实用性等多重挑战

Conclusion: AI不透明性是多维问题，需要技术解决方案和治理框架相结合，XAI发展仍处于早期阶段，需要进一步研究来确保AI系统的透明度和问责制

Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned
as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial
intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly
complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes
of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,
rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,
including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their
stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical
complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from
view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision
systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part
of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the
ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we
explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer
science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows,
explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.

Abstract: AI hardware design is advancing rapidly, driven by the promise of design
automation to make chip development faster, more efficient, and more accessible
to a wide range of users. Amongst automation tools, Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating and streamlining parts of the
design process. However, their potential is hindered by data privacy concerns
and the lack of domain-specific training. To address this, we introduce
FedChip, a Federated fine-tuning approach that enables multiple Chip design
parties to collaboratively enhance a shared LLM dedicated for automated
hardware design generation while protecting proprietary data. FedChip enables
parties to train the model on proprietary local data and improve the shared
LLM's performance. To exemplify FedChip's deployment, we create and release
APTPU-Gen, a dataset of 30k design variations spanning various performance
metric values such as power, performance, and area (PPA). To encourage the LLM
to generate designs that achieve a balance across multiple quality metrics, we
propose a new design evaluation metric, Chip@k, which statistically evaluates
the quality of generated designs against predefined acceptance criteria.
Experimental results show that FedChip improves design quality by more than 77%
over high-end LLMs while maintaining data privacy

Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation
learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner
observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and
situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed
is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant
information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a
more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from
knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see
several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved
in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general
settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding
of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted
and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to
tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include
huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a
natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically
only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An
explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is
developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented
simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic
procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic
gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency,
robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms,
containing SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a
coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology
structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph
Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two
key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node
Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static
representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically
updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static
embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via
maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time
effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that
DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction
tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and
effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision
makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes
application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However,
existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:
decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not
necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our
work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching
(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative
approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task
like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most
confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,
comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the
human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale
human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.
The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch
outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic
matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an
implementation of our system are available as open source at

Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an
additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given
constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable
distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint
set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we
propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that
penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.
For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is
numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This
approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex
constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to
constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show
that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow
but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is
more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained
generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve
significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target
distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show
how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,
using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several
future research directions. Our code is available at

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge
devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that
distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While
most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many
real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality)
require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection,
segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified
framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at
clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy
(offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and
communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and
introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating
algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed
submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained
linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge,
maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O
consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less
than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task
benchmarks.

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine
learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning
and feature engineering. However, the high computational cost associated with
traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle
Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge.
Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead
to overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically
designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical
metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the
optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the
proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by

predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive
performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space.
Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection,
meta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear
dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with
non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for
linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework
for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address
this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms
infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent
space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear
interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the
Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in
turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details
and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in
existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a
dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate
linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical
systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that
DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing
prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up
to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid,
maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from
aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored
for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation
testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly
benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target
single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically
rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven
approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies
and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance.
Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model
formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse
control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source
platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building
flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables
synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres
to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL
implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study
coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results
show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand
below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated
superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the
standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of
two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three
existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be
unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further
propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into
designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class
information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is
challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To
address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and
inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship
between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called
Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or
far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further
away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis
and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

Conclusion: FedSheafHN通过层束协作机制有效解决了子图联邦学习中的异构性问题，为个性化模型生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph
federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a
local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for
each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance
variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local
subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework
built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors
with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds
each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by
leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the
collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN
generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing
personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it
exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

Conclusion: PS-PFN成功扩展了CASH框架，能够有效选择和适配现代ML流水线，为复杂ML工作流提供了新的AutoML解决方案

Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been
fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of
pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization
and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques.
While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a
downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands
novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and
adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit
adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed
bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to
efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via
in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying
costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions
individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing
standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN
compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data
available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Trans-XFed architecture that combines federated
learning with explainable AI techniques for supply chain credit assessment. The
proposed model aims to address several key challenges, including privacy,
information silos, class imbalance, non-identically and independently

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with
wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made
significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series
forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of
self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested
Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of
explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias
for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested
relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle
multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a
grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity
using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and
Transformer-based models.

Abstract: Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge
aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater
overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can
provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating
uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have
offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their
reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication
outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that
enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution
integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,
compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution.
Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for
optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy
consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer
data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical
measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ
per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly
less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE
0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to
align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low
energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general,
our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more
resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub

Abstract: Tabular data, consisting of rows and columns, is omnipresent across various

can be combined or transformed to create new, more informative features. Such
feature engineering is essential to achieve peak performance in machine

substantial effort has been put into automating it. Yet, existing automated
feature engineering (AutoFE) methods have never been investigated regarding
their usability for practitioners. Thus, we investigated 53 AutoFE methods. We
found that these methods are, in general, hard to use, lack documentation, and
have no active communities. Furthermore, no method allows users to set time and
memory constraints, which we see as a necessity for usable automation. Our

Conclusion: ASDFormer具有作为生物标志物发现工具的潜力，既能提高分类性能，又能更可解释地识别与障碍相关的生物标志物。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition
marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can
be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped
into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.
Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these
communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively
capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical
development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker
discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based
architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to
capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple
specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively
emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to
autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more
interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the
ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and
reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD,
highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand
for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining
is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this
paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning
algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive
structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning
by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant
computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this
end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to
approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of
first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,
we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data
removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives
dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order
optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without
constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning
baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning
quality. Our code is released at https://github.com/NKUShaw/ZOWFKGIF.

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool
in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs
struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when
trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based
chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by
construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to
ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To
address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic
Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian
framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of
Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and
minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference
time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing
architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry
tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs,
and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy
out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP
yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is the problem of sequentially estimating the state of
a dynamical system from noisy observations. Recent advances in generative
modeling have inspired new approaches to DA in high-dimensional nonlinear
settings, especially the ensemble score filter (EnSF). However, these come at a
significant computational burden due to slow sampling. In this paper, we
introduce a new filtering framework based on flow matching (FM) -- called the
ensemble flow filter (EnFF) -- to accelerate sampling and enable flexible
design of probability paths. EnFF -- a training-free DA approach -- integrates
MC estimators for the marginal FM vector field (VF) and a localized guidance to
assimilate observations. EnFF has faster sampling and more flexibility in VF
design compared to existing generative modeling for DA. Theoretically, we show
that EnFF encompasses classical filtering methods such as the bootstrap
particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter as special cases. Experiments on
high-dimensional filtering benchmarks demonstrate improved cost-accuracy
tradeoffs and the ability to leverage larger ensembles than prior methods. Our
results highlight the promise of FM as a scalable tool for filtering in
high-dimensional applications that enable the use of large ensembles.

Abstract: Many safety-critical real-world problems, such as autonomous driving and
collaborative robots, are of a distributed multi-agent nature. To optimize the
performance of these systems while ensuring safety, we can cast them as
distributed optimization problems, where each agent aims to optimize their
parameters to maximize a coupled reward function subject to coupled
constraints. Prior work either studies a centralized setting, does not consider
safety, or struggles with sample efficiency. Since we require sample efficiency
and work with unknown and nonconvex rewards and constraints, we solve this
optimization problem using safe Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process
regression. Moreover, we consider nearest-neighbor communication between the
agents. To capture the behavior of non-neighboring agents, we reformulate the
static global optimization problem as a time-varying local optimization problem
for each agent, essentially introducing time as a latent variable. To this end,
we propose a custom spatio-temporal kernel to integrate prior knowledge. We
show the successful deployment of our algorithm in simulations.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential
equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a
loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily
added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered
as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after
the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as
a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from
numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large
variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a
core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test
two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for
training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two
hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based
training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes.
The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g.,
random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results
show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy
and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the
differential equation.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across
real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this
issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal
Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used
in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially
resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the
activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize
Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation.
PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose
estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics
simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and
hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional
STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,
we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to
their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can
reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects
used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving
macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive
performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first
systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the
advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the
potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement
Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and
scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in
HAR.

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the
development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI
classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or
cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new
framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention
mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in
this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time
interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to
selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing
time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized
interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE
dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static
graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint
modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI

Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous
driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners
commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging
multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent
uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework
based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into
calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By
introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures
inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction
intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and
yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential
decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple
locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also
exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either
fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored
in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper,
we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information
sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose
learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to
benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms
incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as
agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We
establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity
associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$,
where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary
strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained
heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance
contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across
simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in
real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often
struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural
patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering
mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel
framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware
graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value
embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical
spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables
learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral
kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection
bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to
model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through
attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during
feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks
demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and
direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.

Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured
confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice.
Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on
unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives
bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its
theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied
work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of
practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically
comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal
scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including
symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a
common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a
recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to
counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency
(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving
both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method
in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to
assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a
practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning
model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data
characteristics.
  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package,
CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods
through a unified interface.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of
\citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,
enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed
noises, have recently attracted significant attention
\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.
However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few
exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits
(MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed
bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the
loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus
function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm
for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity
assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$
worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log
T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework
to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed
linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an
$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the
best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose
a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware
stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW
regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions
are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear
loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear
bandits.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequential decision-making for
Sharpe ratio (SR) maximization in a stochastic bandit setting. We focus on the
Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its
empirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of
Gaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives
focusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead
introduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling
risk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical
contributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for
the Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the
reward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish
fundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \texttt{SRTS} in
terms of an upper bound on regret. We also derive the matching lower bound and
show the order-optimality. Our results show that Thompson Sampling achieves
logarithmic regret over time, with distribution-dependent factors capturing the
difficulty of distinguishing arms based on risk-adjusted performance. Empirical
simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
algorithms.

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across
domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling
decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key
bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client
participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other
approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate
communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in
a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent
Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically
determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication
efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness
of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG
classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show
consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final
quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups
highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of
federated learning.

Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in
predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms.
Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to
classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper
introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the
Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose
using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent
representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with
imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an
innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a
Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of
this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark
datasets for IR.

Abstract: Intrusion Tolerant Systems (ITSs) have become increasingly critical due to
the rise of multi-domain adversaries exploiting diverse attack surfaces. ITS
architectures aim to tolerate intrusions, ensuring system compromise is
prevented or mitigated even with adversary presence. Existing ITS solutions
often employ Risk Managers leveraging public security intelligence to adjust
system defenses dynamically against emerging threats. However, these approaches
rely heavily on databases like NVD and ExploitDB, which require manual analysis
for newly discovered vulnerabilities. This dependency limits the system's
responsiveness to rapidly evolving threats. HAL 9000, an ITS Risk Manager
introduced in our prior work, addressed these challenges through machine
learning. By analyzing descriptions of known vulnerabilities, HAL 9000 predicts
and assesses new vulnerabilities automatically. To calculate the risk of a
system, it also incorporates the Exploitability Probability Scoring system to
estimate the likelihood of exploitation within 30 days, enhancing proactive
defense capabilities.
  Despite its success, HAL 9000's reliance on NVD and ExploitDB knowledge is a
limitation, considering the availability of other sources of information. This
extended work introduces a custom-built scraper that continuously mines diverse
threat sources, including security advisories, research forums, and real-time
exploit proofs-of-concept. This significantly expands HAL 9000's intelligence
base, enabling earlier detection and assessment of unverified vulnerabilities.
Our evaluation demonstrates that integrating scraper-derived intelligence with
HAL 9000's risk management framework substantially improves its ability to
address emerging threats. This paper details the scraper's integration into the
architecture, its role in providing additional information on new threats, and
the effects on HAL 9000's management.

and allocates computational resources for time-constrained analysis. A traffic
routing algorithm is devised to minimize the inter-satellite communication
overhead. OrbitChain adopts a pipeline workflow that completes Earth
observation tasks in real-time, facilitates time-sensitive applications and
inter-constellation collaborations such as tip-and-cue. To evaluate OrbitChain,

observation analytics framework while reducing the communication overhead by up

Abstract: Biometric authentication using physiological signals offers a promising path
toward secure and user-friendly access control in wearable devices. While
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have shown high discriminability, their
intrusive sensing requirements and discontinuous acquisition limit
practicality. Photoplethysmography (PPG), on the other hand, enables

macro F1-score of 0.88, False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.48%, False Rejection
Rate (FRR) of 11.77%, and Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.76%. Our 25 Hz system
reduces sensor power consumption by 53% compared to 512 Hz and 19% compared to
128 Hz setups without compromising performance. We find that sampling at 25 Hz
preserves authentication accuracy, whereas performance drops sharply at 20 Hz
while offering only trivial additional power savings, underscoring 25 Hz as the
practical lower bound. Additionally, we find that models trained exclusively on
resting data fail under motion, while activity-diverse training improves
robustness across physiological states.

TL;DR: 该论文提出校准推荐系统来解决传统推荐系统忽略用户次要兴趣领域的问题，通过分析用户画像、候选项目和推荐列表的三维分布来保证推荐多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统只推荐最相关或最相似的项目，容易忽略用户次要兴趣领域，影响用户体验。需要一种能保证推荐列表包含较少代表性领域的校准方法。

Method: 实现15个模型来分析用户画像、候选项目和推荐列表的三维分布结构（G维，G为系统总类型数），使用异常检测模型来理解这些分布的结构。

Result: 在三个电影领域数据集上的评估显示，异常检测模型能更好地理解分布结构，校准系统创建的推荐列表与传统推荐列表表现相似，但允许用户同等程度地改变偏好组。

Conclusion: 校准推荐系统通过分析多维分布结构，能够在保持推荐质量的同时提高推荐的多样性，解决传统推荐系统忽略次要兴趣领域的问题。

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems aim to generate a recommendation list
comprising the most relevant or similar items to the user's profile. These
approaches can create recommendation lists that omit item genres from the less
prominent areas of a user's profile, thereby undermining the user's experience.
To solve this problem, the calibrated recommendation system provides a
guarantee of including less representative areas in the recommended list. The
calibrated context works with three distributions. The first is from the user's
profile, the second is from the candidate items, and the last is from the
recommendation list. These distributions are G-dimensional, where G is the
total number of genres in the system. This high dimensionality requires a
different evaluation method, considering that traditional recommenders operate
in a one-dimensional data space. In this sense, we implement fifteen models
that help to understand how these distributions are structured. We evaluate the
users' patterns in three datasets from the movie domain. The results indicate
that the models of outlier detection provide a better understanding of the
structures. The calibrated system creates recommendation lists that act
similarly to traditional recommendation lists, allowing users to change their
groups of preferences to the same degree.

Abstract: Discovering the governing equations of a physical system and designing an
effective feedback controller remains one of the most challenging and intensive
areas of ongoing research. This task demands a deep understanding of the system
behavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this
article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized
physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is
identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback
controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to
the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which
guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed. Unlike the prior related
works, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked
regression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback
linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.

Motivation: 癫痫手术的成功高度依赖于准确识别发作起始区(SOZ)，传统方法存在局限性。本研究旨在开发一种基于chirp事件时间频率分析的统计方法来补充现有的SOZ定位技术。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 无监督异常检测 - 使用局部异常因子(LOF)分析识别基于频谱时间特征的异常通道；2) 空间相关性分析 - 计算精确匹配和加权索引相似性，考虑半球一致性和电极邻近性。

Result: LOF方法(N=20, contamination=0.2)有效检测异常通道，加权索引匹配在SOZ定位中优于精确匹配。无癫痫发作患者(索引精度均值:0.903)和手术成功患者(0.865)表现最佳，失败病例一致性较低(0.460)。

Conclusion: 基于chirp的异常检测结合加权空间指标为SOZ定位提供了有效的补充方法，特别适用于手术成功的患者。

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial
concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and
statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of
chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)
Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with
adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on
spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and
temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both
exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating
hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that
the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects
outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming
exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)
were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those
with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas
failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The
key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted
spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization,
particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public
health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better
understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA
rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on
statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological
interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are
difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We
present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with
mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious
diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model
leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare
transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA
spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial
resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports
counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We
also show that CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5%
compared to machine learning baselines, while also identifying high-risk
regions and cost-effective strategies for allocating infection prevention
resources.

Method: 提出了CROC（collapsing receiver operating characteristic）方法，作为FROC方法的扩展，专门处理罕见变异。使用遗传分析工作坊17的小外显子数据集中的533个SNP进行评估。

Result: CROC方法（AUC=0.605）比仅使用常见变异的模型（AUC=0.585）更准确。当常见变异数量减少时，CROC表现优于FROC，在只有罕见变异的情况下，CROC的AUC为0.603，而FROC仅为0.524。

Conclusion: CROC方法能够有效整合常见和罕见遗传变异，显著提高疾病风险预测的准确性，为临床风险预测提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great
promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk
prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common
genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked
sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome
have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease
prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction
strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are
proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk
prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an
extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional
procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the
use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the
Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction
model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on
common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two
approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis.
We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when
the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario,
when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of
0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance

highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the

most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most

Abstract: A datatset $X$ on $R^2$ is a finite topological space. Current research of a
dataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method
\cite{carlsson}. In \cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was
introduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological
spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology
perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets
are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using
open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types
and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate
the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space,
in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components.
Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer
sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be
well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such
structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as
calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.

Abstract: Understanding the complex and stochastic nature of Gene Regulatory Networks
(GRNs) remains a central challenge in systems biology. Existing modeling
paradigms often struggle to effectively capture the intricate, multi-factor
regulatory logic and to rigorously manage the dual uncertainties of network
structure and kinetic parameters. In response, this work introduces the
Probabilistic Categorical GRN(PC-GRN) framework. It is a novel theoretical
approach founded on the synergistic integration of three core methodologies.
Firstly, category theory provides a formal language for the modularity and
composition of regulatory pathways. Secondly, Bayesian Typed Petri Nets (BTPNs)
serve as an interpretable,mechanistic substrate for modeling stochastic
cellular processes, with kinetic parameters themselves represented as
probability distributions. The central innovation of PC-GRN is its end-to-end
generative Bayesian inference engine, which learns a full posterior
distribution over BTPN models (P (G, {\Theta}|D)) directly from data. This is
achieved by the novel interplay of a GFlowNet, which learns a policy to sample
network topologies, and a HyperNetwork, which performs amortized inference to
predict their corresponding parameter distributions. The resulting framework
provides a mathematically rigorous, biologically interpretable, and
uncertainty-aware representation of GRNs, advancing predictive modeling and
systems-level analysis.

Abstract: Curriculum analytics (CA) studies curriculum structure and student data to
ensure the quality of educational programs. An essential aspect is studying
course properties, which involves assigning each course a representative
difficulty value. This is critical for several aspects of CA, such as quality
control (e.g., monitoring variations over time), course comparisons (e.g.,
articulation), and course recommendation (e.g., advising). Measuring course
difficulty requires careful consideration of multiple factors: First, when
difficulty measures are sensitive to the performance level of enrolled
students, it can bias interpretations by overlooking student diversity. By
assessing difficulty independently of enrolled students' performances, we can
reduce the risk of bias and enable fair, representative assessments of
difficulty. Second, from a measurement theoretic perspective, the measurement
must be reliable and valid to provide a robust basis for subsequent analyses.
Third, difficulty measures should account for covariates, such as the
characteristics of individual students within a diverse populations (e.g.,
transfer status). In recent years, various notions of difficulty have been
proposed. This paper provides the first comprehensive review and comparison of
existing approaches for assessing course difficulty based on grade point
averages and latent trait modeling. It further offers a hands-on tutorial on
model selection, assumption checking, and practical CA applications. These
applications include monitoring course difficulty over time and detecting
courses with disparate outcomes between distinct groups of students (e.g.,
dropouts vs. graduates), ultimately aiming to promote high-quality, fair, and
equitable learning experiences. To support further research and application, we
provide an open-source software package and artificial datasets, facilitating
reproducibility and adoption.

Abstract: This article presents a modern deterministic framework for the study of
leading significant digit distributions in numerical data. Rather than relying
on traditional probabilistic or mixture-based explanations, we demonstrate that
the observed frequencies of leading digits are determined by the underlying
arithmetic, algorithmic, and structural properties of the data-generating
process. Our approach centers on a shift-invariant functional equation, whose
general solution is given by explicit affine-plus-periodic formulas. This
structural formulation explains the diversity of digit distributions
encountered in both empirical and mathematical datasets, including cases with
pronounced deviations from logarithmic or scale-invariant profiles.
  We systematically analyze digit distributions in finite and infinite
datasets, address deterministic sequences such as prime numbers and recurrence
relations, and highlight the emergence of block-structured and fractal
features. The article provides critical examination of probabilistic models,
explicit examples and counterexamples, and discusses limitations and open
problems for further research. Overall, this work establishes a unified
mathematical foundation for digital phenomena and offers a versatile toolset
for modeling and analyzing digit patterns in applied and theoretical contexts.

Abstract: With the widespread use of the internet, there is an increasing need to
ensure the security and privacy of transmitted data. This has led to an
intensified focus on the study of video steganography, which is a technique
that hides data within a video cover to avoid detection. The effectiveness of
any steganography method depends on its ability to embed data without altering
the original video quality while maintaining high efficiency. This paper
proposes a new method to video steganography, which involves utilizing a
Genetic Algorithm (GA) for identifying the Region of Interest (ROI) in the
cover video. The ROI is the area in the video that is the most suitable for
data embedding. The secret data is encrypted using the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES), which is a widely accepted encryption standard, before being
embedded into the cover video, utilizing up to 10% of the cover video. This
process ensures the security and confidentiality of the embedded data. The
performance metrics for assessing the proposed method are the Peak Signal to
Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the encoding and decoding time. The results show that
the proposed method has a high embedding capacity and efficiency, with a PSNR
ranging between 64 and 75 dBs, which indicates that the embedded data is almost
indistinguishable from the original video. Additionally, the method can encode
and decode data quickly, making it efficient for real time applications.

TL;DR: DREAMS是一种新的降维方法，通过正则化项结合t-SNE的局部结构保持和PCA的全局结构保持，生成在两者之间的嵌入谱，有效平衡多尺度结构保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降维方法要么专注于保持局部结构（如t-SNE、UMAP），要么专注于保持全局结构（如MDS、PCA），缺乏能够同时良好保持两者结构的方法。

Method: 通过简单的正则化项将t-SNE的局部结构保持能力与PCA的全局结构保持能力相结合，生成从局部结构化到全局结构化的嵌入谱。

Result: 在7个真实数据集（包括5个单细胞转录组和1个群体遗传学数据集）上进行了基准测试，定性和定量分析均显示DREAMS在多尺度结构保持方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DREAMS方法成功解决了同时保持局部和全局结构的问题，在多个应用领域展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing
high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically
designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS,
PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent
both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction
Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure
preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a
simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings
between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally
well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global
structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets,
including five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population
genetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to
preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

Motivation: MRSA被CDC列为严重抗生素耐药威胁，住院患者面临高风险，需要有效模型来帮助医院管理者降低感染风险

Method: 基于概率编程范式的生成概率模型，用于建模MRSA检测结果序列，并与判别式和生成式机器学习模型进行比较

Result: 在两个真实数据集上验证了模型的有效性，能够回答预测性、因果性和反事实性问题

Conclusion: GenHAI模型为医院MRSA感染风险管理提供了有效的建模工具

Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial
resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening
consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to
a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno
suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital
workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative
probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results
outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used
to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital
administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based
on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately
answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative
and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that leverages 3D pseudo-continuous arterial
spin labeling (3D pCASL) MRI to compute sex-specific vascular scores that
quantify cerebrovascular health and potential disease susceptibility. The brain
is parcellated into spatially contiguous regions of homogeneous perfusion using
supervoxel clustering, capturing both microvascular and macrovascular
contributions. Mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) values are extracted from 186
cognitively healthy participants and used to train a custom convolutional
neural network, achieving 95 percent accuracy in sex classification. This
highlights robust, sex-specific perfusion patterns across the brain.
Additionally, regional CBF variations and age-related effects are
systematically evaluated within male and female cohorts. The proposed vascular
risk-scoring framework enhances understanding of normative brain perfusion and
aging, and may facilitate early detection and personalized interventions for
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.
