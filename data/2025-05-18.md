TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Diversity-aware Reward Adjustment (DRA)的方法，通过引入语义多样性到奖励计算中，解决了GRPO在低资源设置下的多样性-质量不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在低资源设置中表现良好，但其基于标量奖励信号的方法无法捕捉语义多样性，导致多样性-质量不一致。

Method: DRA利用Submodular Mutual Information (SMI)调整奖励，降低冗余补全的权重，增强多样性补全的奖励。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，DRA-GRPO和DGA-DR.GRPO表现优于基线，平均准确率达58.2%，仅需7,000个微调样本和约55美元的训练成本。

Conclusion: DRA方法有效解决了多样性-质量不一致问题，提升了低资源设置下的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for language model post-training,
such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have shown promise in
low-resource settings. However, GRPO typically relies on solution-level and
scalar reward signals that fail to capture the semantic diversity among sampled
completions. This leads to what we identify as a diversity-quality
inconsistency, where distinct reasoning paths may receive indistinguishable
rewards. To address this limitation, we propose $\textit{Diversity-aware Reward
Adjustment}$ (DRA), a method that explicitly incorporates semantic diversity
into the reward computation. DRA uses Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) to
downweight redundant completions and amplify rewards for diverse ones. This
encourages better exploration during learning, while maintaining stable
exploitation of high-quality samples. Our method integrates seamlessly with
both GRPO and its variant DR.~GRPO, resulting in $\textit{DRA-GRPO}$ and
$\textit{DGA-DR.~GRPO}$. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and find that it outperforms recent strong baselines. It achieves
state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 58.2%, using only
7,000 fine-tuning samples and a total training cost of approximately $55. The

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双层系统提示优化方法，通过元学习框架优化系统提示，使其对多样用户提示具有鲁棒性并可迁移到未见任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化工作主要关注任务特定的用户提示，而忽略了可跨任务通用的系统提示优化。

Method: 采用元学习框架，通过在多数据集上迭代优化系统提示和用户提示，确保二者协同。

Result: 在14个未见数据集上验证了方法的有效性，优化后的系统提示能快速适应新任务且性能提升。

Conclusion: 双层系统提示优化显著提升了LLM的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, with
optimizing their input prompts playing a pivotal role in maximizing their
performance. However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic
system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt
optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or
tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized,
applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce
the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to
design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable
to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning
framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various
user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user
prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct
experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we
show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to
diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system
prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer
optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved
performance.

TL;DR: VeriFact是一个事实性评估框架，旨在通过识别和解决不完整和缺失的事实来提升长文本生成的事实性评估。FactRBench是一个新的基准测试，评估长文本响应的精确度和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）生成文本的事实性具有挑战性，尤其是长文本中复杂的句间依赖关系。现有方法常忽略关键上下文和关系事实。

Method: 提出VeriFact框架，改进事实提取和验证，并引入FactRBench基准测试，评估精确度和召回率。

Result: VeriFact显著提升事实完整性和复杂关系的保留，FactRBench显示大模型在同一家族中表现更好，但高精确度不一定与高召回率相关。

Conclusion: VeriFact和FactRBench为长文本生成的事实性评估提供了更全面的方法，强调了精确度和召回率的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating long-form responses, but
evaluating their factuality remains challenging due to complex inter-sentence
dependencies within the generated facts. Prior solutions predominantly follow a
decompose-decontextualize-verify pipeline but often fail to capture essential
context and miss key relational facts. In this paper, we introduce VeriFact, a
factuality evaluation framework designed to enhance fact extraction by
identifying and resolving incomplete and missing facts to support more accurate
verification results. Moreover, we introduce FactRBench , a benchmark that
evaluates both precision and recall in long-form model responses, whereas prior
work primarily focuses on precision. FactRBench provides reference fact sets
from advanced LLMs and human-written answers, enabling recall assessment.
Empirical evaluations show that VeriFact significantly enhances fact
completeness and preserves complex facts with critical relational information,
resulting in more accurate factuality evaluation. Benchmarking various open-
and close-weight LLMs on FactRBench indicate that larger models within same
model family improve precision and recall, but high precision does not always
correlate with high recall, underscoring the importance of comprehensive
factuality assessment.

TL;DR: 论文提出TokenAdapt框架，通过模型无关的tokenizer移植方法和多词Supertokens预分词学习，解决固定tokenization导致的效率与性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定tokenization方案限制了预训练语言模型（LLMs）的效率与性能，尤其在多语言或专业应用中。现有方法计算成本高且难以保留语义。

Method: 提出TokenAdapt框架，包括：1) Tokenadapt（模型无关的tokenizer移植方法），通过局部子词分解和全局语义相似性初始化新token嵌入；2) 多词Supertokens预分词学习以提升压缩率。

Result: TokenAdapt在零样本困惑度测试中显著优于基线方法（如ReTok和TransTokenizer），困惑度比至少降低2倍。

Conclusion: TokenAdapt有效解决了tokenizer移植的语义保留和效率问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LLMs) are often constrained by their fixed
tokenization schemes, leading to inefficiencies and performance limitations,
particularly for multilingual or specialized applications. This tokenizer
lock-in presents significant challenges. standard methods to overcome this
often require prohibitive computational resources. Although tokenizer
replacement with heuristic initialization aims to reduce this burden, existing
methods often require exhaustive residual fine-tuning and still may not fully
preserve semantic nuances or adequately address the underlying compression
inefficiencies. Our framework introduces two innovations: first, Tokenadapt, a
model-agnostic tokenizer transplantation method, and second, novel
pre-tokenization learning for multi-word Supertokens to enhance compression and
reduce fragmentation. Tokenadapt initializes new unique token embeddings via a
hybrid heuristic that combines two methods: a local estimate based on subword
decomposition using the old tokenizer, and a global estimate utilizing the
top-k semantically similar tokens from the original vocabulary. This
methodology aims to preserve semantics while significantly minimizing
retraining requirements. Empirical investigations validate both contributions:
the transplantation heuristic successfully initializes unique tokens, markedly
outperforming conventional baselines and sophisticated methods including
Transtokenizer and ReTok, while our Supertokens achieve notable compression
gains. Our zero-shot perplexity results demonstrate that the TokenAdapt hybrid
initialization consistently yields lower perplexity ratios compared to both
ReTok and TransTokenizer baselines across different base models and newly
trained target tokenizers. TokenAdapt typically reduced the overall perplexity
ratio significantly compared to ReTok, yielding at least a 2-fold improvement
in these aggregate scores.

Method: 通过实验分析‘真理方向’在短对话和长对话中的泛化表现，并提出在对话末尾添加固定关键词的解决方案。

Result: 短对话中‘真理方向’表现良好，但长对话泛化较差；添加固定关键词显著改善了长对话的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM谎言检测在新场景中的泛化挑战，并提出了一种有效的改进方法。

Abstract: Several recent works argue that LLMs have a universal truth direction where
true and false statements are linearly separable in the activation space of the
model. It has been demonstrated that linear probes trained on a single hidden
state of the model already generalize across a range of topics and might even
be used for lie detection in LLM conversations. In this work we explore how
this truth direction generalizes between various conversational formats. We
find good generalization between short conversations that end on a lie, but
poor generalization to longer formats where the lie appears earlier in the
input prompt. We propose a solution that significantly improves this type of
generalization by adding a fixed key phrase at the end of each conversation.
Our results highlight the challenges towards reliable LLM lie detectors that
generalize to new settings.

Conclusion: MePO为提示优化提供了一种高效、可解释且轻量级的方法，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Prompt optimization (PO) offers a practical alternative to fine-tuning large
language models (LLMs), enabling performance improvements without altering
model weights. Existing methods typically rely on advanced, large-scale LLMs
like GPT-4 to generate optimized prompts. However, due to limited downward
compatibility, verbose, instruction-heavy prompts from advanced LLMs can
overwhelm lightweight inference models and degrade response quality. In this
work, we rethink prompt optimization through the lens of interpretable design.
We first identify a set of model-agnostic prompt quality merits and empirically
validate their effectiveness in enhancing prompt and response quality. We then
introduce MePO, a merit-guided, lightweight, and locally deployable prompt
optimizer trained on our preference dataset built from merit-aligned prompts
generated by a lightweight LLM. Unlike prior work, MePO avoids online
optimization reliance, reduces cost and privacy concerns, and, by learning
clear, interpretable merits, generalizes effectively to both large-scale and
lightweight inference models. Experiments demonstrate that MePO achieves better
results across diverse tasks and model types, offering a scalable and robust
solution for real-world deployment. Our model and dataset are available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM因缺乏及时、事实性和个性化信息导致的过拟合和幻觉问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在理解个人信息和生成准确响应方面显著优于基线LLM，且响应时间略有减少。

Conclusion: 知识图谱辅助的RAG方法能有效提升LLM的个性化响应能力，减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has allowed numerous applications,
including the generation of queried responses, to be leveraged in chatbots and
other conversational assistants. Being trained on a plethora of data, LLMs
often undergo high levels of over-fitting, resulting in the generation of extra
and incorrect data, thus causing hallucinations in output generation. One of
the root causes of such problems is the lack of timely, factual, and
personalized information fed to the LLM. In this paper, we propose an approach
to address these problems by introducing retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
using knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist the LLM in personalized response
generation tailored to the users. KGs have the advantage of storing
continuously updated factual information in a structured way. While our KGs can
be used for a variety of frequently updated personal data, such as calendar,
contact, and location data, we focus on calendar data in this paper. Our
experimental results show that our approach works significantly better in
understanding personal information and generating accurate responses compared
to the baseline LLMs using personal data as text inputs, with a moderate
reduction in response time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的隐性偏见不仅是伦理问题，也是技术问题，但目前缺乏标准化的评估方法。

Method: 通过评估预存的LLM逻辑和数学问题数据集，结合社会人口统计角色，计算DIF基准。

Result: 该方法能统计验证LLM行为中的隐性偏见，并发现准确性与隐性偏见呈负相关。

Conclusion: DIF方法为LLM隐性偏见的评估提供了标准化工具，揭示了偏见与性能的关系。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen in prominence over the past few
years, there has been concern over the potential biases in LLMs inherited from
the training data. Previous studies have examined how LLMs exhibit implicit
bias, such as when response generation changes when different social contexts
are introduced. We argue that this implicit bias is not only an ethical, but
also a technical issue, as it reveals an inability of LLMs to accommodate
extraneous information. However, unlike other measures of LLM intelligence,
there are no standard methods to benchmark this specific subset of LLM bias. To
bridge this gap, we developed a method for calculating an easily interpretable
benchmark, DIF (Demographic Implicit Fairness), by evaluating preexisting LLM
logic and math problem datasets with sociodemographic personas. We demonstrate
that this method can statistically validate the presence of implicit bias in
LLM behavior and find an inverse trend between question answering accuracy and
implicit bias, supporting our argument.

Motivation: 当前LLMs在长上下文输入中的检索和推理能力仍有不足，现有方法在平衡检索精度和召回率方面存在挑战。

Method: CAFE采用两阶段方法：粗粒度过滤利用检索头识别和排序相关文档，细粒度引导方法则专注于最相关内容。

Result: 实验表明，CAFE在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，在Mistral模型上分别比SFT和RAG方法提升了22.1%和13.7%的SubEM分数。

Conclusion: CAFE通过粗到细的策略有效提升了多文档问答能力，为LLMs的长上下文处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their input
context length, yet they still struggle with retrieval and reasoning in
long-context inputs. Existing methods propose to utilize the prompt strategy
and retrieval head to alleviate this limitation. However, they still face
challenges in balancing retrieval precision and recall, impacting their
efficacy in answering questions. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{CAFE}$,
a two-stage coarse-to-fine method to enhance multi-document question-answering
capacities. By gradually eliminating the negative impacts of background and
distracting documents, CAFE makes the responses more reliant on the evidence
documents. Initially, a coarse-grained filtering method leverages retrieval
heads to identify and rank relevant documents. Then, a fine-grained steering
method guides attention to the most relevant content. Experiments across
benchmarks show CAFE outperforms baselines, achieving up to 22.1% and 13.7%
SubEM improvement over SFT and RAG methods on the Mistral model, respectively.

Result: 攻击方法有效，且许多LLMs在攻击发布七个月后仍易受攻击，行业应对措施不足。

Conclusion: 随着LLMs的普及和开源化，缺乏干预可能导致危险知识的广泛传播，风险加剧。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly reshape modern life, advancing fields
from healthcare to education and beyond. However, alongside their remarkable
capabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to
jailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems
from the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes
unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn
undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their
intended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by
dark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified
through jailbreak techniques. In our research, we uncovered a universal
jailbreak attack that effectively compromises multiple state-of-the-art models,
enabling them to answer almost any question and produce harmful outputs upon
request. The main idea of our attack was published online over seven months
ago. However, many of the tested LLMs were still vulnerable to this attack.
Despite our responsible disclosure efforts, responses from major LLM providers
were often inadequate, highlighting a concerning gap in industry practices
regarding AI safety. As model training becomes more accessible and cheaper, and
as open-source LLMs proliferate, the risk of widespread misuse escalates.
Without decisive intervention, LLMs may continue democratizing access to
dangerous knowledge, posing greater risks than anticipated.

Conclusion: XRAG是研究LLM推理能力的有效工具，揭示了跨语言RAG的新问题。

Abstract: We propose XRAG, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the generation
abilities of LLMs in cross-lingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
settings where the user language does not match the retrieval results. XRAG is
constructed from recent news articles to ensure that its questions require
external knowledge to be answered. It covers the real-world scenarios of
monolingual and multilingual retrieval, and provides relevancy annotations for
each retrieved document. Our novel dataset construction pipeline results in
questions that require complex reasoning, as evidenced by the significant gap
between human and LLM performance. Consequently, XRAG serves as a valuable
benchmark for studying LLM reasoning abilities, even before considering the
additional cross-lingual complexity. Experimental results on five LLMs uncover
two previously unreported challenges in cross-lingual RAG: 1) in the
monolingual retrieval setting, all evaluated models struggle with response
language correctness; 2) in the multilingual retrieval setting, the main
challenge lies in reasoning over retrieved information across languages rather
than generation of non-English text.

Conclusion: GE-Chat为LLM结论提供可靠资源检查方法，改善用户对其输出的信任判断。

Abstract: Large Language Models are now key assistants in human decision-making
processes. However, a common note always seems to follow: "LLMs can make
mistakes. Be careful with important info." This points to the reality that not
all outputs from LLMs are dependable, and users must evaluate them manually.
The challenge deepens as hallucinated responses, often presented with seemingly
plausible explanations, create complications and raise trust issues among
users. To tackle such issue, this paper proposes GE-Chat, a knowledge Graph
enhanced retrieval-augmented generation framework to provide Evidence-based
response generation. Specifically, when the user uploads a material document, a
knowledge graph will be created, which helps construct a retrieval-augmented
agent, enhancing the agent's responses with additional knowledge beyond its
training corpus. Then we leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic generation,
n-hop sub-graph searching, and entailment-based sentence generation to realize
accurate evidence retrieval. We demonstrate that our method improves the
existing models' performance in terms of identifying the exact evidence in a
free-form context, providing a reliable way to examine the resources of LLM's
conclusion and help with the judgment of the trustworthiness.

Conclusion: Reasoning CPT能有效提升模型的推理能力，并适应问题难度调整推理深度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in
reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning. However, when training reasoning models, these approaches are
primarily applicable to specific domains such as mathematics and programming,
which imposes fundamental constraints on the breadth and scalability of
training data. In contrast, continual pretraining (CPT) offers the advantage of
not requiring task-specific signals. Nevertheless, how to effectively
synthesize training data for reasoning and how such data affect a wide range of
domains remain largely unexplored. This study provides a detailed evaluation of
Reasoning CPT, a form of CPT that uses synthetic data to reconstruct the hidden
thought processes underlying texts, based on the premise that texts are the
result of the author's thinking process. Specifically, we apply Reasoning CPT
to Gemma2-9B using synthetic data with hidden thoughts derived from STEM and
Law corpora, and compare it to standard CPT on the MMLU benchmark. Our analysis
reveals that Reasoning CPT consistently improves performance across all
evaluated domains. Notably, reasoning skills acquired in one domain transfer
effectively to others; the performance gap with conventional methods widens as
problem difficulty increases, with gains of up to 8 points on the most
challenging problems. Furthermore, models trained with hidden thoughts learn to
adjust the depth of their reasoning according to problem difficulty.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) is an essential ingredient in effective usage of
modern large language models, but our understanding of the reasoning strategies
underlying these capabilities remains limited. While some prior works have
attempted to categorize CoTs using predefined strategy types, such approaches
are constrained by human intuition and fail to capture the full diversity of
model behaviors. In this work, we introduce the CoT Encyclopedia, a bottom-up
framework for analyzing and steering model reasoning. Our method automatically
extracts diverse reasoning criteria from model-generated CoTs, embeds them into
a semantic space, clusters them into representative categories, and derives
contrastive rubrics to interpret reasoning behavior. Human evaluations show
that this framework produces more interpretable and comprehensive analyses than
existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that this understanding enables
performance gains: we can predict which strategy a model is likely to use and
guide it toward more effective alternatives. Finally, we provide practical
insights, such as that training data format (e.g., free-form vs.
multiple-choice) has a far greater impact on reasoning behavior than data
domain, underscoring the importance of format-aware model design.

Conclusion: VQ-Logits是一种高效且稳健的方法，适用于LLM输出层优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but face
significant computational and memory challenges, particularly due to their
extensive output vocabularies. The final linear projection layer, mapping
hidden states to vocabulary-sized logits, often constitutes a substantial
portion of the model's parameters and computational cost during inference.
Existing methods like adaptive softmax or hierarchical softmax introduce
structural complexities. In this paper, we propose VQ-Logits, a novel approach
that leverages Vector Quantization (VQ) to drastically reduce the parameter
count and computational load of the LLM output layer. VQ-Logits replaces the
large V * dmodel output embedding matrix with a small, shared codebook of K
embedding vectors (K << V ). Each token in the vocabulary is mapped to one of
these K codebook vectors. The LLM predicts logits over this compact codebook,
which are then efficiently "scattered" to the full vocabulary space using the
learned or preassigned mapping. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on
standard language modeling benchmarks (e.g., WikiText-103, C4) that VQ-Logits
can achieve up to 99% parameter reduction in the output layer and 6x speedup in
logit computation, with only a marginal 4% increase in perplexity compared to
full softmax baselines. We further provide detailed ablation studies on
codebook size, initialization, and learning strategies, showcasing the
robustness and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: In the era of increasingly sophisticated natural language processing (NLP)
systems, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential
for diverse applications, including tasks requiring nuanced textual
understanding and contextual reasoning. This study investigates the
capabilities of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLAMA3,
Mistral 7B, and Claude-2 - for zero-shot and few-shot annotation of a complex
textual dataset comprising social media posts in Russian and Ukrainian.
Specifically, the focus is on the binary classification task of identifying
references to human rights violations within the dataset.
  To evaluate the effectiveness of these models, their annotations are compared
against a gold standard set of human double-annotated labels across 1000
samples. The analysis includes assessing annotation performance under different
prompting conditions, with prompts provided in both English and Russian.
Additionally, the study explores the unique patterns of errors and
disagreements exhibited by each model, offering insights into their strengths,
limitations, and cross-linguistic adaptability.
  By juxtaposing LLM outputs with human annotations, this research contributes
to understanding the reliability and applicability of LLMs for sensitive,
domain-specific tasks in multilingual contexts. It also sheds light on how
language models handle inherently subjective and context-dependent judgments, a
critical consideration for their deployment in real-world scenarios.

Method: 采用强化学习训练J1模型，将可验证和不可验证的提示转换为具有可验证奖励的判断任务，激励思考并减少判断偏差。

Result: J1在8B和70B规模上超越所有现有模型，包括从DeepSeek-R1蒸馏的模型，并在某些基准上优于o1-mini和R1。

Conclusion: J1模型通过学习生成评估标准、与自生成参考答案比较以及重新评估模型响应的正确性，实现了更好的判断能力。

Abstract: The progress of AI is bottlenecked by the quality of evaluation, and powerful
LLM-as-a-Judge models have proved to be a core solution. Improved judgment
ability is enabled by stronger chain-of-thought reasoning, motivating the need
to find the best recipes for training such models to think. In this work we
introduce J1, a reinforcement learning approach to training such models. Our
method converts both verifiable and non-verifiable prompts to judgment tasks
with verifiable rewards that incentivize thinking and mitigate judgment bias.
In particular, our approach outperforms all other existing 8B or 70B models
when trained at those sizes, including models distilled from DeepSeek-R1. J1
also outperforms o1-mini, and even R1 on some benchmarks, despite training a
smaller model. We provide analysis and ablations comparing Pairwise-J1 vs
Pointwise-J1 models, offline vs online training recipes, reward strategies,
seed prompts, and variations in thought length and content. We find that our
models make better judgments by learning to outline evaluation criteria,
comparing against self-generated reference answers, and re-evaluating the
correctness of model responses.

Result: RPG在CodeRepetEval、HumanEval和MBPP基准测试中显著优于基线方法，有效减少了重复并提升了代码质量。

Conclusion: RPG为解决代码生成中的结构重复问题提供了一种高效方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation
has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the
generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on
content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition
problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is
structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in
various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently
reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition
and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for
Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems
in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to
identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically
decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions,
thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we
construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches
for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the
best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and
MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of
generated code.

Conclusion: CL-RAG通过课程学习有效优化了RAG系统的训练，提升了性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an effective method to enhance the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods focus on
optimizing the retriever or generator in the RAG system by directly utilizing
the top-k retrieved documents. However, the documents effectiveness are various
significantly across user queries, i.e. some documents provide valuable
knowledge while others totally lack critical information. It hinders the
retriever and generator's adaptation during training. Inspired by human
cognitive learning, curriculum learning trains models using samples progressing
from easy to difficult, thus enhancing their generalization ability, and we
integrate this effective paradigm to the training of the RAG system. In this
paper, we propose a multi-stage Curriculum Learning based RAG system training
framework, named CL-RAG. We first construct training data with multiple
difficulty levels for the retriever and generator separately through sample
evolution. Then, we train the model in stages based on the curriculum learning
approach, thereby optimizing the overall performance and generalization of the
RAG system more effectively. Our CL-RAG framework demonstrates consistent
effectiveness across four open-domain QA datasets, achieving performance gains
of 2% to 4% over multiple advanced methods.

Abstract: Code security and usability are both essential for various coding assistant
applications driven by large language models (LLMs). Current code security
benchmarks focus solely on single evaluation task and paradigm, such as code
completion and generation, lacking comprehensive assessment across dimensions
like secure code generation, vulnerability repair and discrimination. In this

such as code completion, vulnerability repair, vulnerability detection and
classification, for comprehensive evaluation of LLM code security. Besides, we

experts and can review LLM-generated programs for vulnerabilities in a more
efficient and reliable way. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
proprietary and open-source LLMs. Overall, while most LLMs identify vulnerable

advantages: it introduces only a negligible number of additional parameters,
requires no architectural changes--ensuring compatibility with off-the-shelf
pretrained language models--and remains aligned with the next-token pretraining
objective, making it especially well-suited for supervised fine-tuning.
Moreover, it naturally supports scalable prediction horizons. We demonstrate
the effectiveness and versatility of MuToR across a range of use cases,
including supervised fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and
pretraining, on challenging generative tasks in both language and vision

Abstract: Motivated by scaling laws in language modeling that demonstrate how test loss
scales as a power law with model and dataset sizes, we find that similar laws
exist in preference modeling. We propose World Preference Modeling$ (WorldPM)
to emphasize this scaling potential, where World Preference embodies a unified
representation of human preferences. In this paper, we collect preference data
from public forums covering diverse user communities, and conduct extensive
training using 15M-scale data across models ranging from 1.5B to 72B
parameters. We observe distinct patterns across different evaluation metrics:
(1) Adversarial metrics (ability to identify deceptive features) consistently
scale up with increased training data and base model size; (2) Objective
metrics (objective knowledge with well-defined answers) show emergent behavior
in larger language models, highlighting WorldPM's scalability potential; (3)
Subjective metrics (subjective preferences from a limited number of humans or
AI) do not demonstrate scaling trends. Further experiments validate the
effectiveness of WorldPM as a foundation for preference fine-tuning. Through
evaluations on 7 benchmarks with 20 subtasks, we find that WorldPM broadly
improves the generalization performance across human preference datasets of
varying sizes (7K, 100K and 800K samples), with performance gains exceeding 5%
on many key subtasks. Integrating WorldPM into our internal RLHF pipeline, we
observe significant improvements on both in-house and public evaluation sets,
with notable gains of 4% to 8% in our in-house evaluations.

Conclusion: 显式元能力对齐为推理提供了可扩展且可靠的基础。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) already possess a latent capacity for long
chain-of-thought reasoning. Prior work has shown that outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) can incidentally elicit advanced reasoning
behaviors such as self-correction, backtracking, and verification phenomena
often referred to as the model's "aha moment". However, the timing and
consistency of these emergent behaviors remain unpredictable and
uncontrollable, limiting the scalability and reliability of LRMs' reasoning
capabilities. To address these limitations, we move beyond reliance on prompts
and coincidental "aha moments". Instead, we explicitly align models with three
meta-abilities: deduction, induction, and abduction, using automatically
generated, self-verifiable tasks. Our three stage-pipeline individual
alignment, parameter-space merging, and domain-specific reinforcement learning,
boosting performance by over 10\% relative to instruction-tuned baselines.
Furthermore, domain-specific RL from the aligned checkpoint yields an
additional 2\% average gain in the performance ceiling across math, coding, and
science benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit meta-ability alignment offers a
scalable and dependable foundation for reasoning. Code is available at:

Conclusion: LLMs存在显著隐私风险，需加强防护措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various domains but pose inherent
privacy risks. Existing methods to evaluate privacy leakage in LLMs often use
memorized prefixes or simple instructions to extract data, both of which
well-alignment models can easily block. Meanwhile, Jailbreak attacks bypass LLM
safety mechanisms to generate harmful content, but their role in privacy
scenarios remains underexplored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of
jailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage
and jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework
targeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the
limitations of current jailbreak methods. Specifically, PIG identifies PII
entities and their types in privacy queries, uses in-context learning to build
a privacy context, and iteratively updates it with three gradient-based
strategies to elicit target PII. We evaluate PIG and existing jailbreak methods
using two privacy-related datasets. Experiments on four white-box and two
black-box LLMs show that PIG outperforms baseline methods and achieves
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results. The results underscore significant privacy
risks in LLMs, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards. Our code is

large-scale incentivized experiment, participants (quiz takers) completed an
online quiz where persuaders (either humans or LLMs) attempted to persuade quiz
takers toward correct or incorrect answers. We find that LLM persuaders
achieved significantly higher compliance with their directional persuasion
attempts than incentivized human persuaders, demonstrating superior persuasive
capabilities in both truthful (toward correct answers) and deceptive (toward
incorrect answers) contexts. We also find that LLM persuaders significantly
increased quiz takers' accuracy, leading to higher earnings, when steering quiz
takers toward correct answers, and significantly decreased their accuracy,
leading to lower earnings, when steering them toward incorrect answers.
Overall, our findings suggest that AI's persuasion capabilities already exceed

Abstract: Each year, tens of millions of essays are written and graded in college-level
English courses. Students are asked to analyze literary and cultural texts
through a process known as close reading, in which they gather textual details
to formulate evidence-based arguments. Despite being viewed as a basis for
critical thinking and widely adopted as a required element of university
coursework, close reading has never been evaluated on large language models
(LLMs), and multi-discipline benchmarks like MMLU do not include literature as
a subject. To fill this gap, we present KRISTEVA, the first close reading
benchmark for evaluating interpretive reasoning, consisting of 1331
multiple-choice questions adapted from classroom data. With KRISTEVA, we
propose three progressively more difficult sets of tasks to approximate
different elements of the close reading process, which we use to test how well
LLMs may seem to understand and reason about literary works: 1) extracting
stylistic features, 2) retrieving relevant contextual information from
parametric knowledge, and 3) multi-hop reasoning between style and external
contexts. Our baseline results find that, while state-of-the-art LLMs possess

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about the
misuse of AI-generated text, making watermarking a promising solution.
Mainstream watermarking schemes for LLMs fall into two categories: logits-based
and sampling-based. However, current schemes entail trade-offs among
robustness, text quality, and security. To mitigate this, we integrate
logits-based and sampling-based schemes, harnessing their respective strengths
to achieve synergy. In this paper, we propose a versatile symbiotic
watermarking framework with three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid. The
hybrid framework adaptively embeds watermarks using token entropy and semantic
entropy, optimizing the balance between detectability, robustness, text
quality, and security. Furthermore, we validate our approach through
comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We believe this framework provides novel

through multi-LLM collaboration, and implement experiments to enhance reasoning
coherence. Experiments on the RAIDEN benchmark demonstrate RAIDEN-R1's
superiority: our 14B-GRPO model achieves 88.04% and 88.65% accuracy on
Script-Based Knowledge and Conversation Memory metrics, respectively,
outperforming baseline models while maintaining robustness. Case analyses
further reveal the model's enhanced ability to resolve conflicting contextual
cues and sustain first-person narrative consistency. This work bridges the
non-quantifiability gap in RPCA training and provides insights into role-aware
reasoning patterns, advancing the development of RPCAs.

Motivation: 现实中的RAG应用常面临长上下文输入问题，冗余信息和噪声导致高推理成本和性能下降。

Method: LongRefiner采用双级查询分析、层次化文档结构和基于多任务学习的自适应优化，使用单一基础模型。

Result: 在七个QA数据集上，LongRefiner性能接近最佳基线，同时计算成本和延迟降低10倍。

Conclusion: LongRefiner具有可扩展性、高效性和实用性，为长文本RAG应用提供了实际解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world RAG applications often encounter long-context input scenarios,
where redundant information and noise results in higher inference costs and
reduced performance. To address these challenges, we propose LongRefiner, an
efficient plug-and-play refiner that leverages the inherent structural
characteristics of long documents. LongRefiner employs dual-level query
analysis, hierarchical document structuring, and adaptive refinement through
multi-task learning on a single foundation model. Experiments on seven QA
datasets demonstrate that LongRefiner achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while using 10x fewer computational costs and latency
compared to the best baseline. Further analysis validates that LongRefiner is
scalable, efficient, and effective, providing practical insights for real-world
long-text RAG applications. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Chain-of-Thought方法为线性推理，而DCoLT支持双向非线性推理，无需中间步骤语法正确。

Method: 在两种扩散语言模型（SEDD和LLaDA）上实现DCoLT，利用强化学习优化推理轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，DCoLT增强的模型在数学和代码生成任务上表现优于其他方法，准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: DCoLT为扩散语言模型提供了一种高效的推理优化方法。

Abstract: We introduce the \emph{Diffusion Chain of Lateral Thought (DCoLT)}, a
reasoning framework for diffusion language models. DCoLT treats each
intermediate step in the reverse diffusion process as a latent "thinking"
action and optimizes the entire reasoning trajectory to maximize the reward on
the correctness of the final answer with outcome-based Reinforcement Learning
(RL). Unlike traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods that follow a causal,
linear thinking process, DCoLT allows bidirectional, non-linear reasoning with
no strict rule on grammatical correctness amid its intermediate steps of
thought. We implement DCoLT on two representative Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs). First, we choose SEDD as a representative continuous-time discrete
diffusion model, where its concrete score derives a probabilistic policy to
maximize the RL reward over the entire sequence of intermediate diffusion
steps. We further consider the discrete-time masked diffusion language model --
LLaDA, and find that the order to predict and unmask tokens plays an essential
role to optimize its RL action resulting from the ranking-based Unmasking
Policy Module (UPM) defined by the Plackett-Luce model. Experiments on both
math and code generation tasks show that using only public data and 16 H800
GPUs, DCoLT-reinforced DLMs outperform other DLMs trained by SFT or RL or even
both. Notably, DCoLT-reinforced LLaDA boosts its reasoning accuracy by +9.8%,
+5.7%, +11.4%, +19.5% on GSM8K, MATH, MBPP, and HumanEval.

Abstract: Effective communication about breast and cervical cancers remains a
persistent health challenge, with significant gaps in public understanding of
cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, potentially leading to delayed
diagnoses and inadequate treatments. This study evaluates the capabilities and
limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate, safe, and
accessible cancer-related information to support patient understanding. We
evaluated five general-purpose and three medical LLMs using a mixed-methods
evaluation framework across linguistic quality, safety and trustworthiness, and
communication accessibility and affectiveness. Our approach utilized
quantitative metrics, qualitative expert ratings, and statistical analysis
using Welch's ANOVA, Games-Howell, and Hedges' g. Our results show that
general-purpose LLMs produced outputs of higher linguistic quality and
affectiveness, while medical LLMs demonstrate greater communication
accessibility. However, medical LLMs tend to exhibit higher levels of potential
harm, toxicity, and bias, reducing their performance in safety and
trustworthiness. Our findings indicate a duality between domain-specific
knowledge and safety in health communications. The results highlight the need
for intentional model design with targeted improvements, particularly in
mitigating harm and bias, and improving safety and affectiveness. This study
provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for cancer communication, offering
critical insights for improving AI-generated health content and informing
future development of accurate, safe, and accessible digital health tools.

underexplored. We investigate whether LLMs possess meaningful parametric
knowledge-encoded in their pretrained weights-to predict conflict escalation
and fatalities without external data. This is critical for early warning
systems, humanitarian planning, and policy-making. We compare this parametric
knowledge with non-parametric capabilities, where LLMs access structured and
unstructured context from conflict datasets (e.g., ACLED, GDELT) and recent
news reports via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Incorporating external
information could enhance model performance by providing up-to-date context
otherwise missing from pretrained weights. Our two-part evaluation framework
spans 2020-2024 across conflict-prone regions in the Horn of Africa and the
Middle East. In the parametric setting, LLMs predict conflict trends and
fatalities relying only on pretrained knowledge. In the non-parametric setting,
models receive summaries of recent conflict events, indicators, and
geopolitical developments. We compare predicted conflict trend labels (e.g.,
Escalate, Stable Conflict, De-escalate, Peace) and fatalities against

Abstract: Semantic text representation is a fundamental task in the field of natural
language processing. Existing text embedding (e.g., SimCSE and LLM2Vec) have
demonstrated excellent performance, but the values of each dimension are
difficult to trace and interpret. Bag-of-words, as classic sparse interpretable
embeddings, suffers from poor performance. Recently, Benara et al. (2024)
propose interpretable text embeddings using large language models, which forms
"0/1" embeddings based on responses to a series of questions. These
interpretable text embeddings are typically high-dimensional (larger than
10,000). In this work, we propose Low-dimensional (lower than 500) Dense and
Interpretable text embeddings with Relative representations (LDIR). The
numerical values of its dimensions indicate semantic relatedness to different
anchor texts through farthest point sampling, offering both semantic
representation as well as a certain level of traceability and interpretability.
We validate LDIR on multiple semantic textual similarity, retrieval, and
clustering tasks. Extensive experimental results show that LDIR performs close
to the black-box baseline models and outperforms the interpretable embeddings
baselines with much fewer dimensions. Code is available at

Result: LLM生成的PLS在主观评分中表现接近人类写作，但在理解效果上显著较差；自动化评估指标与人类判断不一致。

Abstract: Plain language summaries (PLSs) are essential for facilitating effective
communication between clinicians and patients by making complex medical
information easier for laypeople to understand and act upon. Large language
models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in automating PLS generation, but
their effectiveness in supporting health information comprehension remains
unclear. Prior evaluations have generally relied on automated scores that do
not measure understandability directly, or subjective Likert-scale ratings from
convenience samples with limited generalizability. To address these gaps, we
conducted a large-scale crowdsourced evaluation of LLM-generated PLSs using
Amazon Mechanical Turk with 150 participants. We assessed PLS quality through
subjective Likert-scale ratings focusing on simplicity, informativeness,
coherence, and faithfulness; and objective multiple-choice comprehension and
recall measures of reader understanding. Additionally, we examined the
alignment between 10 automated evaluation metrics and human judgments. Our
findings indicate that while LLMs can generate PLSs that appear
indistinguishable from human-written ones in subjective evaluations,
human-written PLSs lead to significantly better comprehension. Furthermore,
automated evaluation metrics fail to reflect human judgment, calling into
question their suitability for evaluating PLSs. This is the first study to
systematically evaluate LLM-generated PLSs based on both reader preferences and
comprehension outcomes. Our findings highlight the need for evaluation
frameworks that move beyond surface-level quality and for generation methods
that explicitly optimize for layperson comprehension.

to exploit the Graph Convolution operation in GNNs to encode the context and
use it in coalition with LSTMs to predict the next word given a local context
of preceding words. We test this on the custom Wikipedia text corpus using a
very limited amount of resources and show that this approach works fairly well
to predict the next word.

Abstract: Translation-based strategies for cross-lingual transfer XLT such as
translate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the
source language -- and translate-test -- evaluating on noisy source language
data translated from the target language -- are competitive XLT baselines. In
XLT for token classification tasks, however, these strategies include label
projection, the challenging step of mapping the labels from each token in the
original sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. Although word
aligners (WAs) are commonly used for label projection, the low-level design
decisions for applying them to translation-based XLT have not been
systematically investigated. Moreover, recent marker-based methods, which
project labeled spans by inserting tags around them before (or after)
translation, claim to outperform WAs in label projection for XLT. In this work,
we revisit WAs for label projection, systematically investigating the effects
of low-level design decisions on token-level XLT: (i) the algorithm for
projecting labels between (multi-)token spans, (ii) filtering strategies to
reduce the number of noisily mapped labels, and (iii) the pre-tokenization of
the translated sentences. We find that all of these substantially impact
translation-based XLT performance and show that, with optimized choices, XLT
with WA offers performance at least comparable to that of marker-based methods.
We then introduce a new projection strategy that ensembles translate-train and
translate-test predictions and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms
the marker-based projection. Crucially, we show that our proposed ensembling
also reduces sensitivity to low-level WA design choices, resulting in more
robust XLT for token classification tasks.

underscore the critical need for regional localized models, this paper examines
primary differences between variants of written Spanish across Latin America
and Spain, with an in-depth sociocultural and linguistic contextualization
therein. We argue that these differences effectively constitute significant
gaps in the quotidian use of Spanish among dialectal groups by creating
sociolinguistic dissonances, to the extent that locale-sensitive AI models
would play a pivotal role in bridging these divides. In doing so, this approach
informs better and more efficient localization strategies that also serve to
more adequately meet inclusivity goals, while securing sustainable active daily
user growth in a major low-risk investment geographic area. Therefore,
implementing at least the proposed five sub variants of Spanish addresses two
lines of action: to foment user trust and reliance on AI language models while
also demonstrating a level of cultural, historical, and sociolinguistic
awareness that reflects positively on any internationalization strategy.

Abstract: Pretrained language models (PLMs) for African languages are continually
improving, but the reasons behind these advances remain unclear. This paper
presents the first systematic investigation into probing PLMs for linguistic
knowledge about African languages. We train layer-wise probes for six
typologically diverse African languages to analyse how linguistic features are
distributed. We also design control tasks, a way to interpret probe
performance, for the MasakhaPOS dataset. We find PLMs adapted for African
languages to encode more linguistic information about target languages than
massively multilingual PLMs. Our results reaffirm previous findings that
token-level syntactic information concentrates in middle-to-last layers, while
sentence-level semantic information is distributed across all layers. Through
control tasks and probing baselines, we confirm that performance reflects the
internal knowledge of PLMs rather than probe memorisation. Our study applies
established interpretability techniques to African-language PLMs. In doing so,
we highlight the internal mechanisms underlying the success of strategies like
active learning and multilingual adaptation.

TL;DR: Quicker是一个基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的临床决策支持系统，用于自动化证据合成和生成临床建议，显著提升效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床证据整合到实时实践中存在挑战，需要自动化工具支持高效决策。

Method: Quicker通过LLM实现全自动流程，从问题分解到临床建议生成，并支持定制化决策。

Result: Quicker在Q2CRBench-3基准测试中表现优异，检索和筛选性能接近人类专家，推荐更全面且逻辑连贯。

Conclusion: Quicker能帮助医生更快、更可靠地做出基于证据的临床决策。

Abstract: Clinical evidence, derived from rigorous research and data analysis, provides
healthcare professionals with reliable scientific foundations for informed
decision-making. Integrating clinical evidence into real-time practice is
challenging due to the enormous workload, complex professional processes, and
time constraints. This highlights the need for tools that automate evidence
synthesis to support more efficient and accurate decision making in clinical
settings. This study introduces Quicker, an evidence-based clinical decision
support system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to automate
evidence synthesis and generate clinical recommendations modeled after standard
clinical guideline development processes. Quicker implements a fully automated
chain that covers all phases, from questions to clinical recommendations, and
further enables customized decision-making through integrated tools and
interactive user interfaces. To evaluate Quicker's capabilities, we developed
the Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset, based on clinical guideline development
records for three different diseases. Experimental results highlighted
Quicker's strong performance, with fine-grained question decomposition tailored
to user preferences, retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and
literature screening performance approaching comprehensive inclusion of
relevant studies. In addition, Quicker-assisted evidence assessment effectively
supported human reviewers, while Quicker's recommendations were more
comprehensive and logically coherent than those of clinicians. In system-level
testing, collaboration between a single reviewer and Quicker reduced the time
required for recommendation development to 20-40 minutes. In general, our
findings affirm the potential of Quicker to help physicians make quicker and
more reliable evidence-based clinical decisions.

Abstract: Decoding thoughts from brain activity offers valuable insights into human
cognition and enables promising applications in brain-computer interaction.
While prior studies have explored language reconstruction from fMRI data, they
are typically limited to single-modality inputs such as images or audio. In
contrast, human thought is inherently multimodal. To bridge this gap, we
propose a unified and flexible framework for reconstructing coherent language
from brain recordings elicited by diverse input modalities-visual, auditory,
and textual. Our approach leverages visual-language models (VLMs), using
modality-specific experts to jointly interpret information across modalities.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art systems while remaining adaptable and extensible. This work
advances toward more ecologically valid and generalizable mind decoding.

Result: 模型在识别常见实体（如MET和PAT）上表现良好，但对低频实体（如EVOL）仍有挑战。

Conclusion: NLP技术能有效自动化临床数据提取，但需进一步优化低频实体的识别。

Abstract: Research projects, including those focused on cancer, rely on the manual
extraction of information from clinical reports. This process is time-consuming
and prone to errors, limiting the efficiency of data-driven approaches in
healthcare. To address these challenges, Natural Language Processing (NLP)
offers an alternative for automating the extraction of relevant data from
electronic health records (EHRs). In this study, we focus on lung and breast
cancer due to their high incidence and the significant impact they have on
public health. Early detection and effective data management in both types of
cancer are crucial for improving patient outcomes. To enhance the accuracy and
efficiency of data extraction, we utilized GMV's NLP tool uQuery, which excels
at identifying relevant entities in clinical texts and converting them into
standardized formats such as SNOMED and OMOP. uQuery not only detects and
classifies entities but also associates them with contextual information,
including negated entities, temporal aspects, and patient-related details. In
this work, we explore the use of NLP techniques, specifically Named Entity
Recognition (NER), to automatically identify and extract key clinical
information from EHRs related to these two cancers. A dataset from Health
Research Institute Hospital La Fe (IIS La Fe), comprising 200 annotated breast
cancer and 400 lung cancer reports, was used, with eight clinical entities
manually labeled using the Doccano platform. To perform NER, we fine-tuned the
bsc-bio-ehr-en3 model, a RoBERTa-based biomedical linguistic model pre-trained
in Spanish. Fine-tuning was performed using the Transformers architecture,
enabling accurate recognition of clinical entities in these cancer types. Our
results demonstrate strong overall performance, particularly in identifying
entities like MET and PAT, although challenges remain with less frequent
entities like EVOL.

Abstract: Wildfires have become increasingly frequent, irregular, and severe in recent
years. Understanding how affected populations perceive and respond during
wildfire crises is critical for timely and empathetic disaster response. Social
media platforms offer a crowd-sourced channel to capture evolving public
discourse, providing hyperlocal information and insight into public sentiment.
This study analyzes Reddit discourse during the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires,
spanning from the onset of the disaster to full containment. We collect 385
posts and 114,879 comments related to the Palisades and Eaton fires. We adopt
topic modeling methods to identify the latent topics, enhanced by large
language models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop (HITL) refinement. Furthermore, we
develop a hierarchical framework to categorize latent topics, consisting of two
main categories, Situational Awareness (SA) and Crisis Narratives (CN). The
volume of SA category closely aligns with real-world fire progressions, peaking
within the first 2-5 days as the fires reach the maximum extent. The most
frequent co-occurring category set of public health and safety, loss and
damage, and emergency resources expands on a wide range of health-related
latent topics, including environmental health, occupational health, and one
health. Grief signals and mental health risks consistently accounted for 60
percentage and 40 percentage of CN instances, respectively, with the highest
total volume occurring at night. This study contributes the first annotated
social media dataset on the 2025 LA fires, and introduces a scalable
multi-layer framework that leverages topic modeling for crisis discourse
analysis. By identifying persistent public health concerns, our results can
inform more empathetic and adaptive strategies for disaster response, public
health communication, and future research in comparable climate-related
disaster events.

Motivation: 现有基准测试仅关注答案正确性，忽略了模型是否真正理解视觉输入，导致评估不全面。

Method: 通过解耦视觉和文本模态的因果注意力模块，分析注意力分布，并提出注意力准确率作为评估指标。

Result: 研究发现，随着网络层加深，注意力分布会集中在与正确答案相关的图像上，注意力准确率能有效量化IVM。

Conclusion: 注意力准确率是一种可靠且通用的评估方法，适用于多模态和单模态场景。

Abstract: Recent advancements have enhanced the capability of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to comprehend multi-image information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily evaluate answer correctness, overlooking whether models
genuinely comprehend the visual input. To address this, we define implicit
visual misunderstanding (IVM), where MLLMs provide correct answers without
fully comprehending the visual input. Through our analysis, we decouple the
visual and textual modalities within the causal attention module, revealing
that attention distribution increasingly converges on the image associated with
the correct answer as the network layers deepen. This insight leads to the
introduction of a scale-agnostic metric, \textit{attention accuracy}, and a
novel benchmark for quantifying IVMs. Attention accuracy directly evaluates the
model's visual understanding via internal mechanisms, remaining robust to
positional biases for more reliable assessments. Furthermore, we extend our
approach to finer granularities and demonstrate its effectiveness in unimodal
scenarios, underscoring its versatility and generalizability.

Result: 实验表明，ETT在多项任务上性能提升2-6%，同时保持原有重建能力。

Conclusion: ETT是一种简单有效的方法，有望推动多模态基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Existing vision tokenization isolates the optimization of vision tokenizers
from downstream training, implicitly assuming the visual tokens can generalize
well across various tasks, e.g., image generation and visual question
answering. The vision tokenizer optimized for low-level reconstruction is
agnostic to downstream tasks requiring varied representations and semantics.
This decoupled paradigm introduces a critical misalignment: The loss of the
vision tokenization can be the representation bottleneck for target tasks. For
example, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when
recognizing or generating them. To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end
vision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision
tokenization and target autoregressive tasks. Unlike prior autoregressive
models that use only discrete indices from a frozen vision tokenizer, ETT
leverages the visual embeddings of the tokenizer codebook, and optimizes the
vision tokenizers end-to-end with both reconstruction and caption objectives.
ETT can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal
architecture modifications. Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate,
without the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the
employed large language models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning unlocks significant performance
gains, i.e., 2-6% for multimodal understanding and visual generation tasks
compared to frozen tokenizer baselines, while preserving the original
reconstruction capability. We hope this very simple and strong method can
empower multimodal foundation models besides image generation and
understanding.

Conclusion: MMRL和MMRL++有效解决了小样本过拟合问题，提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly
advanced transfer learning across diverse tasks. However, adapting these models
with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, undermining their
ability to generalize to new tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Modal
Representation Learning (MMRL), which introduces a shared, learnable,
modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL generates space tokens projected
into both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more
effective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize
class token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder
layers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving
general knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and
representation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is
applied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection
layer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To
further promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning
class and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features. At inference,
a decoupling strategy uses both class and representation features for base
tasks, but only class features for novel tasks due to their stronger
generalization. Building upon this, we propose MMRL++, a parameter-efficient
and interaction-aware extension that significantly reduces trainable parameters
and enhances intra-modal interactions--particularly across the layers of
representation tokens--allowing gradient sharing and instance-specific
information to propagate more effectively through the network. Extensive
experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL and MMRL++ consistently
outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving a strong balance between
task-specific adaptation and generalization.

Abstract: Natural language image-caption datasets, widely used for training Large
Multimodal Models, mainly focus on natural scenarios and overlook the intricate

hindering the advancement of current LMMs in multimodal mathematical reasoning.
To this end, we propose leveraging code as supervision for cross-modal
alignment, since code inherently encodes all information needed to generate
corresponding figures, establishing a precise connection between the two
modalities. Specifically, we co-develop our image-to-code model and dataset
with model-in-the-loop approach, resulting in an image-to-code model,
FigCodifier and ImgCode-8.6M dataset, the largest image-code dataset to date.
Furthermore, we utilize FigCodifier to synthesize novel mathematical figures

instruction fine-tuning dataset. Finally, we present MathCoder-VL, trained with
ImgCode-8.6M for cross-modal alignment and subsequently fine-tuned on
MM-MathInstruct-3M for multimodal math problem solving. Our model achieves a

Abstract: Generating realistic dyadic human motion from text descriptions presents
significant challenges, particularly for extended interactions that exceed
typical training sequence lengths. While recent transformer-based approaches
have shown promising results for short-term dyadic motion synthesis, they
struggle with longer sequences due to inherent limitations in positional
encoding schemes. In this paper, we introduce Dyadic Mamba, a novel approach
that leverages State-Space Models (SSMs) to generate high-quality dyadic human
motion of arbitrary length. Our method employs a simple yet effective
architecture that facilitates information flow between individual motion
sequences through concatenation, eliminating the need for complex
cross-attention mechanisms. We demonstrate that Dyadic Mamba achieves
competitive performance on standard short-term benchmarks while significantly
outperforming transformer-based approaches on longer sequences. Additionally,
we propose a new benchmark for evaluating long-term motion synthesis quality,
providing a standardized framework for future research. Our results demonstrate
that SSM-based architectures offer a promising direction for addressing the
challenging task of long-term dyadic human motion synthesis from text
descriptions.

Conclusion: AdaptCLIP提供了一种简单有效的跨域泛化方法，无需目标域微调。

Abstract: Universal visual anomaly detection aims to identify anomalies from novel or
unseen vision domains without additional fine-tuning, which is critical in open
scenarios. Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-trained vision-language
models like CLIP exhibit strong generalization with just zero or a few normal
images. However, existing methods struggle with designing prompt templates,
complex token interactions, or requiring additional fine-tuning, resulting in
limited flexibility. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method
called AdaptCLIP based on two key insights. First, adaptive visual and textual
representations should be learned alternately rather than jointly. Second,
comparative learning between query and normal image prompt should incorporate
both contextual and aligned residual features, rather than relying solely on
residual features. AdaptCLIP treats CLIP models as a foundational service,
adding only three simple adapters, visual adapter, textual adapter, and
prompt-query adapter, at its input or output ends. AdaptCLIP supports
zero-/few-shot generalization across domains and possesses a training-free
manner on target domains once trained on a base dataset. AdaptCLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 12 anomaly detection benchmarks from industrial
and medical domains, significantly outperforming existing competitive methods.
We will make the code and model of AdaptCLIP available at

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在场景理解方面存在局限性，尤其是对虚拟对象的推理能力不足。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are AI systems paired with both language and
vision encoders to process multimodal input. They are capable of performing
complex semantic tasks such as automatic captioning, but it remains an open
question about how well they comprehend the visuospatial properties of scenes
depicted in the images they process. We argue that descriptions of virtual
objects -- objects that are not visually represented in an image -- can help
test scene comprehension in these AI systems. For example, an image that
depicts a person standing under a tree can be paired with the following prompt:
imagine that a kite is stuck in the tree. VLMs that comprehend the scene should
update their representations and reason sensibly about the spatial relations
between all three objects. We describe systematic evaluations of
state-of-the-art VLMs and show that their ability to process virtual objects is
inadequate.

Abstract: The emergence of unified multimodal understanding and generation models is
rapidly attracting attention because of their ability to enhance
instruction-following capabilities while minimizing model redundancy. However,
there is a lack of a unified evaluation framework for these models, which would
enable an elegant, simplified, and overall evaluation. Current models conduct
evaluations on multiple task-specific benchmarks, but there are significant
limitations, such as the lack of overall results, errors from extra evaluation
models, reliance on extensive labeled images, benchmarks that lack diversity,
and metrics with limited capacity for instruction-following evaluation. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce UniEval, the first evaluation framework
designed for unified multimodal models without extra models, images, or
annotations. This facilitates a simplified and unified evaluation process. The
UniEval framework contains a holistic benchmark, UniBench (supports both
unified and visual generation models), along with the corresponding UniScore
metric. UniBench includes 81 fine-grained tags contributing to high diversity.
Experimental results indicate that UniBench is more challenging than existing
benchmarks, and UniScore aligns closely with human evaluations, surpassing
current metrics. Moreover, we extensively evaluated SoTA unified and visual
generation models, uncovering new insights into Univeral's unique values.

Motivation: 指向是语言与视觉上下文结合的基本机制，现有基准仅关注对象定位任务，缺乏多样化评估。

Method: PointArena包含三个组件：Point-Bench（数据集）、Point-Battle（交互式竞技场）和Point-Act（机器人系统），用于多阶段评估。

Result: Molmo-72B表现最佳，专有模型性能接近；针对指向任务的监督训练显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Pointing serves as a fundamental and intuitive mechanism for grounding
language within visual contexts, with applications spanning robotics, assistive
technologies, and interactive AI systems. While recent multimodal models have
started to support pointing capabilities, existing benchmarks typically focus
only on referential object localization tasks. We introduce PointArena, a
comprehensive platform for evaluating multimodal pointing across diverse
reasoning scenarios. PointArena comprises three components: (1) Point-Bench, a
curated dataset containing approximately 1,000 pointing tasks across five
reasoning categories; (2) Point-Battle, an interactive, web-based arena
facilitating blind, pairwise model comparisons, which has already gathered over
4,500 anonymized votes; and (3) Point-Act, a real-world robotic manipulation
system allowing users to directly evaluate multimodal model pointing
capabilities in practical settings. We conducted extensive evaluations of both
state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary multimodal models. Results
indicate that Molmo-72B consistently outperforms other models, though
proprietary models increasingly demonstrate comparable performance.
Additionally, we find that supervised training specifically targeting pointing
tasks significantly enhances model performance. Across our multi-stage
evaluation pipeline, we also observe strong correlations, underscoring the
critical role of precise pointing capabilities in enabling multimodal models to
effectively bridge abstract reasoning with concrete, real-world actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据获取和标注困难，半监督方法依赖未标注数据且效果受限。

Method: BoundarySeg框架结合器官边界预测和全器官分割任务，利用任务间一致性提供额外监督。

Result: 在低数据情况下，性能优于或与现有半监督方法相当，且无需未标注数据。

Conclusion: BoundarySeg是一种高效且计算成本低的方法，适用于医学图像分割。

Abstract: Obtaining large-scale medical data, annotated or unannotated, is challenging
due to stringent privacy regulations and data protection policies. In addition,
annotating medical images requires that domain experts manually delineate
anatomical structures, making the process both time-consuming and costly. As a
result, semi-supervised methods have gained popularity for reducing annotation
costs. However, the performance of semi-supervised methods is heavily dependent
on the availability of unannotated data, and their effectiveness declines when
such data are scarce or absent. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
simple, yet effective and computationally efficient approach for medical image
segmentation that leverages only existing annotations. We propose BoundarySeg ,
a multi-task framework that incorporates organ boundary prediction as an
auxiliary task to full organ segmentation, leveraging consistency between the
two task predictions to provide additional supervision. This strategy improves
segmentation accuracy, especially in low data regimes, allowing our method to
achieve performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art semi supervised
approaches all without relying on unannotated data or increasing computational
demands. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 研究如何通过结构化表示和类比映射模拟人类快速学习视觉概念的能力。

Method: 提出Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI)，结合深度学习和类比映射，权衡对象相似性和关系相似性。

Result: PSI表现接近人类学习能力，优于传统原型模型和弱结构化变体。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和类比映射是模拟人类快速学习的关键，深度学习可助力心理学模型构建。

Abstract: The ability to learn new visual concepts from limited examples is a hallmark
of human cognition. While traditional category learning models represent each
example as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is
thought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed
graphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of
shared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here,
we introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that
employs deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured
representations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept
called a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity
that weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a
mechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to
selective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces
human-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model
that uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model,
and a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find
that PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that
increases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the
contribution of relations that distinguish classes. These findings suggest that
structured representations and analogical mapping are critical to modeling
rapid human-like learning of compositional visual concepts, and demonstrate how
deep learning can be leveraged to create psychological models.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了无源域适应的性能。

Abstract: Domain adaptation addresses the challenge of model performance degradation
caused by domain gaps. In the typical setup for unsupervised domain adaptation,
labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a target domain are
used to train a target model. However, access to labeled source domain data,
particularly in medical datasets, can be restricted due to privacy policies. As
a result, research has increasingly shifted to source-free domain adaptation
(SFDA), which requires only a pretrained model from the source domain and
unlabeled data from the target domain data for adaptation. Existing SFDA
methods often rely on domain-specific image style translation and
self-supervision techniques to bridge the domain gap and train the target
domain model. However, the quality of domain-specific style-translated images
and pseudo-labels produced by these methods still leaves room for improvement.
Moreover, training the entire model during adaptation can be inefficient under
limited supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel SFDA framework to
address these challenges. Specifically, to effectively mitigate the impact of
domain gap in the initial training phase, we introduce preadaptation to
generate a preadapted model, which serves as an initialization of target model
and allows for the generation of high-quality enhanced pseudo-labels without
introducing extra parameters. Additionally, we propose a data-dependent
frequency prompt to more effectively translate target domain images into a
source-like style. To further enhance adaptation, we employ a style-related
layer fine-tuning strategy, specifically designed for SFDA, to train the target
model using the prompted target domain images and pseudo-labels. Extensive
experiments on cross-modality abdominal and cardiac SFDA segmentation tasks
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods.

demonstrate improved progression prediction quality and anatomical fidelity,

Conclusion: DITM通过灵活的监督机制和层次对齐策略，显著提升了图像-文本匹配的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Image-text matching aims to build correspondences between visual and textual
data by learning their pairwise similarities. Most existing approaches have
adopted sparse binary supervision, indicating whether a pair of images and
sentences matches or not. However, such sparse supervision covers a limited
subset of image-text relationships, neglecting their inherent many-to-many
correspondences; an image can be described in numerous texts at different
descriptive levels. Moreover, existing approaches overlook the implicit
connections from general to specific descriptions, which form the underlying
rationale for the many-to-many relationships between vision and language. In
this work, we propose descriptive image-text matching, called DITM, to learn
the graded contextual similarity between image and text by exploring the
descriptive flexibility of language. We formulate the descriptiveness score of
each sentence with cumulative term frequency-inverse document frequency
(TF-IDF) to balance the pairwise similarity according to the keywords in the
sentence. Our method leverages sentence descriptiveness to learn robust
image-text matching in two key ways: (1) to refine the false negative labeling,
dynamically relaxing the connectivity between positive and negative pairs, and
(2) to build more precise matching, aligning a set of relevant sentences in a
generic-to-specific order. By moving beyond rigid binary supervision, DITM
enhances the discovery of both optimal matches and potential positive pairs.
Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, and CxC datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in representing complex image-text relationships
compared to state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, DITM enhances the
hierarchical reasoning ability of the model, supported by the extensive
analysis on HierarCaps benchmark.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the low-resource Pashto language.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Pashto faces several challenges due to the
cursive nature of its script and a scarcity of structured datasets. To address
this, we developed a synthetic Pashto OCR dataset, PsOCR, consisting of one
million images annotated with bounding boxes at word, line, and document
levels, suitable for training and evaluating models based on different
architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers.
PsOCR covers variations across 1,000 unique font families, colors, image sizes,
and layouts. A benchmark subset of 10K images was selected to evaluate the
performance of several LMMs, including seven open-source models: DeepSeek's
Janus, InternVL, MiniCPM, Florence, and Qwen (3B and 7B), and four
closed-source models: GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, and Grok. Experimental results
demonstrate that Gemini achieves the best performance among all models, whereas
among open-source models, Qwen-7B stands out. This work provides an insightful
assessment of the capabilities and limitations of current LMMs for OCR tasks in
Pashto and establishes a foundation for further research not only in Pashto OCR
but also for other similar scripts such as Arabic, Persian, and Urdu. PsOCR is

Result: MoB在LLaVA-1.5-7B上仅使用11.1%的原始视觉令牌保留了96.4%的性能，并在LLaVA-Next-7B上加速1.3-1.5倍。

Conclusion: MoB在多种先进MLLM和视觉语言任务中表现出色，具有理论保证和线性可扩展性。

Abstract: Existing visual token pruning methods target prompt alignment and visual
preservation with static strategies, overlooking the varying relative
importance of these objectives across tasks, which leads to inconsistent
performance. To address this, we derive the first closed-form error bound for
visual token pruning based on the Hausdorff distance, uniformly characterizing
the contributions of both objectives. Moreover, leveraging $\epsilon$-covering
theory, we reveal an intrinsic trade-off between these objectives and quantify
their optimal attainment levels under a fixed budget. To practically handle
this trade-off, we propose Multi-Objective Balanced Covering (MoB), which
reformulates visual token pruning as a bi-objective covering problem. In this
framework, the attainment trade-off reduces to budget allocation via greedy
radius trading. MoB offers a provable performance bound and linear scalability
with respect to the number of input visual tokens, enabling adaptation to
challenging pruning scenarios. Extensive experiments show that MoB preserves
96.4% of performance for LLaVA-1.5-7B using only 11.1% of the original visual
tokens and accelerates LLaVA-Next-7B by 1.3-1.5$\times$ with negligible
performance loss. Additionally, evaluations on Qwen2-VL and Video-LLaVA confirm
that MoB integrates seamlessly into advanced MLLMs and diverse vision-language

Abstract: Federated domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable model from
multiple decentralized source domains for deploying on the unseen target
domain. The style augmentation methods have achieved great progress on domain
generalization. However, the existing style augmentation methods either explore
the data styles within isolated source domain or interpolate the style
information across existing source domains under the data decentralization
scenario, which leads to limited style space. To address this issue, we propose
a Multi-source Collaborative Style Augmentation and Domain-invariant learning
method (MCSAD) for federated domain generalization. Specifically, we propose a
multi-source collaborative style augmentation module to generate data in the
broader style space. Furthermore, we conduct domain-invariant learning between
the original data and augmented data by cross-domain feature alignment within
the same class and classes relation ensemble distillation between different
classes to learn a domain-invariant model. By alternatively conducting
collaborative style augmentation and domain-invariant learning, the model can
generalize well on unseen target domain. Extensive experiments on multiple
domain generalization datasets indicate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art federated domain generalization methods.

Abstract: Human image animation has gained increasing attention and developed rapidly
due to its broad applications in digital humans. However, existing methods rely
largely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits
generalization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation.
To tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video
Crafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences
(i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT
(4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens.
Compared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust
spatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image
and character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we
introduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention
with 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as
4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D
world. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new
direction for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our
MTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98,
surpassing the second-best by 65%. Powered by robust motion tokens, MTVCrafter
also generalizes well to diverse open-world characters (single/multiple,
full/half-body) across various styles and scenarios. Our video demos and code

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object
combinations by leveraging known combinations. Existing studies basically rely
on the cross-modal alignment capabilities of CLIP but tend to overlook its
limitations in capturing fine-grained local features, which arise from its
architectural and training paradigm. To address this issue, we propose a

utilizes intermediate-layer information from CLIP's visual encoder.
Specifically, we design two self-adaptive aggregators to extract local
information from low-level visual features and integrate global information
from high-level visual features, respectively. These key information are
progressively incorporated into textual representations through a
stage-by-stage interaction mechanism, significantly enhancing the model's
perception capability for fine-grained local visual information. Additionally,
MSCI dynamically adjusts the attention weights between global and local visual
information based on different combinations, as well as different elements
within the same combination, allowing it to flexibly adapt to diverse
scenarios. Experiments on three widely used datasets fully validate the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model. Data and code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉叙事系统中角色身份不一致和动作与主体关联不当的问题，通过视觉元素的实体链接提升叙事一致性。

Method: 使用StoryReasoning数据集（4,178个故事），结合跨帧对象重识别、链式思维推理和视觉实体链接，微调Qwen2.5-VL 7B模型。

Result: 微调后的Qwen Storyteller模型将幻觉问题从4.06降至3.56（-12.3%）。

Conclusion: 通过视觉实体链接和结构化推理，显著提升视觉叙事的一致性。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems struggle to maintain character identity across
frames and link actions to appropriate subjects, frequently leading to
referential hallucinations. These issues can be addressed through grounding of
characters, objects, and other entities on the visual elements. We propose
StoryReasoning, a dataset containing 4,178 stories derived from 52,016 movie
images, with both structured scene analyses and grounded stories. Each story
maintains character and object consistency across frames while explicitly
modeling multi-frame relationships through structured tabular representations.
Our approach features cross-frame object re-identification using visual
similarity and face recognition, chain-of-thought reasoning for explicit
narrative modeling, and a grounding scheme that links textual elements to
visual entities across multiple frames. We establish baseline performance by
fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL 7B, creating Qwen Storyteller, which performs end-to-end
object detection, re-identification, and landmark detection while maintaining
consistent object references throughout the story. Evaluation demonstrates a
reduction from 4.06 to 3.56 (-12.3%) hallucinations on average per story when
compared to a non-fine-tuned model.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning shows promise in harnessing extensive unlabeled
data, but it also confronts significant privacy concerns, especially in vision.
In this paper, we perform membership inference on visual self-supervised models
in a more realistic setting: self-supervised training method and details are
unknown for an adversary when attacking as he usually faces a black-box system
in practice. In this setting, considering that self-supervised model could be
trained by completely different self-supervised paradigms, e.g., masked image
modeling and contrastive learning, with complex training details, we propose a
unified membership inference method called PartCrop. It is motivated by the
shared part-aware capability among models and stronger part response on the
training data. Specifically, PartCrop crops parts of objects in an image to
query responses within the image in representation space. We conduct extensive
attacks on self-supervised models with different training protocols and
structures using three widely used image datasets. The results verify the
effectiveness and generalization of PartCrop. Moreover, to defend against
PartCrop, we evaluate two common approaches, i.e., early stop and differential
privacy, and propose a tailored method called shrinking crop scale range. The
defense experiments indicate that all of them are effective. Finally, besides
prototype testing on toy visual encoders and small-scale image datasets, we
quantitatively study the impacts of scaling from both data and model aspects in
a realistic scenario and propose a scalable PartCrop-v2 by introducing two
structural improvements to PartCrop. Our code is at

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown competitive performance to
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in various vision tasks, while offering
superior energy efficiency. However, existing SNN-based Transformers primarily
focus on single-image tasks, emphasizing spatial features while not effectively

a spike-driven Hamming attention (SDHA) which provides a theoretically guided
adaptation from traditional real-valued attention to spike-driven attention.
Building on SDHA, we further analyze various spike-driven space-time attention
designs and identify an optimal scheme that delivers appealing performance for
video tasks, while maintaining only linear temporal complexity. The
generalization ability and efficiency of our model are demonstrated across
diverse downstream video tasks, including classification, human pose tracking,
and semantic segmentation. Empirical results show our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing SNN approaches, with
over 15\% improvement on the latter two tasks. Additionally, it matches the

Conclusion: Logos数据集和跨语言迁移学习方法显著提升了ISLR任务的性能。

Abstract: This paper examines two aspects of the isolated sign language recognition
(ISLR) task. First, despite the availability of a number of datasets, the
amount of data for most individual sign languages is limited. It poses the
challenge of cross-language ISLR model training, including transfer learning.
Second, similar signs can have different semantic meanings. It leads to
ambiguity in dataset labeling and raises the question of the best policy for
annotating such signs. To address these issues, this study presents Logos, a
novel Russian Sign Language (RSL) dataset, the most extensive ISLR dataset by
the number of signers and one of the largest available datasets while also the
largest RSL dataset in size and vocabulary. It is shown that a model,
pre-trained on the Logos dataset can be used as a universal encoder for other
language SLR tasks, including few-shot learning. We explore cross-language
transfer learning approaches and find that joint training using multiple
classification heads benefits accuracy for the target lowresource datasets the
most. The key feature of the Logos dataset is explicitly annotated visually
similar sign groups. We show that explicitly labeling visually similar signs
improves trained model quality as a visual encoder for downstream tasks. Based
on the proposed contributions, we outperform current state-of-the-art results
for the WLASL dataset and get competitive results for the AUTSL dataset, with a
single stream model processing solely RGB video. The source code, dataset, and
pre-trained models are publicly available.

Method: 提出VariReal流程，通过LLM生成文本提示，对源图像进行最小编辑以生成可行或不可行图像。实验基于LoRA微调的CLIP模型，评估三种细粒度数据集上的分类性能。

Result: 可行性对CLIP分类性能影响极小（差异<0.3%），且不同属性对性能的影响不同。混合可行与不可行图像训练对性能无显著影响。

Conclusion: 合成图像的可行性对CLIP分类器性能影响有限，无需严格筛选。

Abstract: With the development of photorealistic diffusion models, models trained in
part or fully on synthetic data achieve progressively better results. However,
diffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in
reality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture
artifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a
synthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic
images containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered
infeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered
out-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a
model's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be
excluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility
really matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is
necessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers,
focusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We
introduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to
include feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated
by a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally
affects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference
in top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute
matters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the
classification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in
training datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using
purely feasible or infeasible datasets.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in modeling image priors via diffusion models,
3D-aware image editing remains challenging, in part because the object is only
specified via a single image. To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a
new framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework
supports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D
rotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses
the generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes
real-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training
data pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a
single trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames,
we incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this
challenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space. We
design a data generation pipeline to ensure high-quality 3D guidance throughout
training. Results show that by integrating these 3D priors, 3D-Fixup
effectively supports complex, identity coherent 3D-aware edits, achieving
high-quality results and advancing the application of diffusion models in
realistic image manipulation. The code is provided at

conditioning on past frames and robot actions. Specifically, we consider world
models that operate on RGB-D frames (RGB-D world models). As opposed to
canonical approaches that handle dynamics prediction mostly implicitly and
reconcile it with visual rendering in a single model, we introduce FlowDreamer,
which adopts 3D scene flow as explicit motion representations. FlowDreamer
first predicts 3D scene flow from past frame and action conditions with a
U-Net, and then a diffusion model will predict the future frame utilizing the
scene flow. FlowDreamer is trained end-to-end despite its modularized nature.
We conduct experiments on 4 different benchmarks, covering both video

Result: 能够高效生成高质量、风格一致的SVG图形。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在风格定制和结构规律性上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their
resolution independence and well-organized layer structure. Although existing
text-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they
often overlook an important need in practical applications: style
customization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics
with consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics. Extending existing
T2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges.
Optimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I)
models for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity.
On the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity,
yet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to
limited SVG training data.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization
pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward
T2V models and T2I image priors. In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion
model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of
SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities. In the second stage, we
customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized
T2I models. By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate
high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an
efficient feed-forward manner. The effectiveness of our method has been
validated through extensive experiments. The project page is

Abstract: Computer-assisted interventions can improve intra-operative guidance,
particularly through deep learning methods that harness the spatiotemporal
information in surgical videos. However, the severe data imbalance often found
in surgical video datasets hinders the development of high-performing models.
In this work, we aim to overcome the data imbalance by synthesizing surgical
videos. We propose a unique two-stage, text-conditioned diffusion-based method
to generate high-fidelity surgical videos for under-represented classes. Our
approach conditions the generation process on text prompts and decouples
spatial and temporal modeling by utilizing a 2D latent diffusion model to
capture spatial content and then integrating temporal attention layers to
ensure temporal consistency. Furthermore, we introduce a rejection sampling
strategy to select the most suitable synthetic samples, effectively augmenting
existing datasets to address class imbalance. We evaluate our method on two
downstream tasks-surgical action recognition and intra-operative event
prediction-demonstrating that incorporating synthetic videos from our approach
substantially enhances model performance. We open-source our implementation at

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a critical role in a wide range
of civilian and military applications. Existing methods suffer from
deficiencies in the localization of dim targets and the perception of contour
information under dense clutter environments, severely limiting their detection
performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a contour-aware and saliency
priors embedding network (CSPENet) for ISTD. We first design a
surround-convergent prior extraction module (SCPEM) that effectively captures
the intrinsic characteristic of target contour pixel gradients converging
toward their center. This module concurrently extracts two collaborative
priors: a boosted saliency prior for accurate target localization and
multi-scale structural priors for comprehensively enriching contour detail
representation. Building upon this, we propose a dual-branch priors embedding
architecture (DBPEA) that establishes differentiated feature fusion pathways,
embedding these two priors at optimal network positions to achieve performance
enhancement. Finally, we develop an attention-guided feature enhancement module
(AGFEM) to refine feature representations and improve saliency estimation
accuracy. Experimental results on public datasets NUDT-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and
NUAA-SIRST demonstrate that our CSPENet outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods in detection performance. The code is available at

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) in the wild remains a challenging task
due to the subtle and localized nature of expression-related features, as well
as the complex variations in facial appearance. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework that explicitly focuses on Texture Key Driver Factors (TKDF),
localized texture regions that exhibit strong discriminative power across
emotional categories. By carefully observing facial image patterns, we identify
that certain texture cues, such as micro-changes in skin around the brows,
eyes, and mouth, serve as primary indicators of emotional dynamics. To
effectively capture and leverage these cues, we propose a FER architecture
comprising a Texture-Aware Feature Extractor (TAFE) and Dual Contextual
Information Filtering (DCIF). TAFE employs a ResNet-based backbone enhanced
with multi-branch attention to extract fine-grained texture representations,
while DCIF refines these features by filtering context through adaptive pooling
and attention mechanisms. Experimental results on RAF-DB and KDEF datasets

typically fixed after training. However, domain shifts caused by changes in the
environment, sensor types, or sensor degradation often lead to a decline in
model performance. Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by
adapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains.
Despite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing
challenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of
catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To
tackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for
ALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer
selection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select
low-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen,
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we
propose an entropy-based consistency loss. By losing such samples based on
entropy, we apply consistency loss only to the reliable samples, enhancing
model stability. In addition, we propose a random parameter interpolation
mechanism, which randomly blends parameters from the selected trainable layers
with those of the source model. This approach helps balance target adaptation
and source knowledge retention, further alleviating forgetting. Finally, we
construct two benchmarks, ISPRSC and H3DC, to address the lack of CTTA
benchmarks for ALS point cloud segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate
that APCoTTA achieves the best performance on two benchmarks, with mIoU
improvements of approximately 9% and 14% over direct inference. The new
benchmarks and code are available at https://github.com/Gaoyuan2/APCoTTA.

Abstract: In the era of immersive consumer electronics, such as AR/VR headsets and
smart devices, people increasingly seek ways to express their identity through
virtual fashion. However, existing 3D garment design tools remain inaccessible
to everyday users due to steep technical barriers and limited data. In this
work, we introduce a 3D sketch-driven 3D garment generation framework that
empowers ordinary users - even those without design experience - to create
high-quality digital clothing through simple 3D sketches in AR/VR environments.
By combining a conditional diffusion model, a sketch encoder trained in a
shared latent space, and an adaptive curriculum learning strategy, our system
interprets imprecise, free-hand input and produces realistic, personalized
garments. To address the scarcity of training data, we also introduce
KO3DClothes, a new dataset of paired 3D garments and user-created sketches.
Extensive experiments and user studies confirm that our method significantly
outperforms existing baselines in both fidelity and usability, demonstrating
its promise for democratized fashion design on next-generation consumer
platforms.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology is progressively transforming traditional car
driving methods, marking a significant milestone in modern transportation.
Object detection serves as a cornerstone of autonomous systems, playing a vital
role in enhancing driving safety, enabling autonomous functionality, improving
traffic efficiency, and facilitating effective emergency responses. However,
current technologies such as radar for environmental perception, cameras for
road perception, and vehicle sensor networks face notable challenges, including
high costs, vulnerability to weather and lighting conditions, and limited
resolution.To address these limitations, this paper presents an improved
autonomous target detection network based on YOLOv8. By integrating structural
reparameterization technology, a bidirectional pyramid structure network model,
and a novel detection pipeline into the YOLOv8 framework, the proposed approach
achieves highly efficient and precise detection of multi-scale, small, and
remote objects. Experimental results demonstrate that the enhanced model can
effectively detect both large and small objects with a detection accuracy of
65%, showcasing significant advancements over traditional methods.This improved
model holds substantial potential for real-world applications and is
well-suited for autonomous driving competitions, such as the Formula Student

single-target and small-object detection.

Abstract: One-shot medical landmark detection gains much attention and achieves great
success for its label-efficient training process. However, existing one-shot
learning methods are highly specialized in a single domain and suffer domain
preference heavily in the situation of multi-domain unlabeled data. Moreover,
one-shot learning is not robust that it faces performance drop when annotating
a sub-optimal image. To tackle these issues, we resort to developing a
domain-adaptive one-shot landmark detection framework for handling multi-domain
medical images, named Universal One-shot Detection (UOD). UOD consists of two
stages and two corresponding universal models which are designed as
combinations of domain-specific modules and domain-shared modules. In the first
stage, a domain-adaptive convolution model is self-supervised learned to
generate pseudo landmark labels. In the second stage, we design a
domain-adaptive transformer to eliminate domain preference and build the global
context for multi-domain data. Even though only one annotated sample from each
domain is available for training, the domain-shared modules help UOD aggregate
all one-shot samples to detect more robust and accurate landmarks. We
investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively the proposed UOD on three
widely-used public X-ray datasets in different anatomical domains (i.e., head,
hand, chest) and obtained state-of-the-art performances in each domain. The
code is available at

Abstract: Dynamic scene representation and reconstruction have undergone transformative
advances in recent years, catalyzed by breakthroughs in neural radiance fields
and 3D Gaussian splatting techniques. While initially developed for static
environments, these methodologies have rapidly evolved to address the
complexities inherent in 4D dynamic scenes through an expansive body of
research. Coupled with innovations in differentiable volumetric rendering,
these approaches have significantly enhanced the quality of motion
representation and dynamic scene reconstruction, thereby garnering substantial
attention from the computer vision and graphics communities. This survey
presents a systematic analysis of over 200 papers focused on dynamic scene
representation using radiance field, spanning the spectrum from implicit neural
representations to explicit Gaussian primitives. We categorize and evaluate
these works through multiple critical lenses: motion representation paradigms,
reconstruction techniques for varied scene dynamics, auxiliary information
integration strategies, and regularization approaches that ensure temporal
consistency and physical plausibility. We organize diverse methodological
approaches under a unified representational framework, concluding with a
critical examination of persistent challenges and promising research
directions. By providing this comprehensive overview, we aim to establish a
definitive reference for researchers entering this rapidly evolving field while
offering experienced practitioners a systematic understanding of both
conceptual principles and practical frontiers in dynamic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a novel image registration formalism dedicated to
the estimation of unknown condition-related images, based on two or more known
images and their associated conditions. We show how to practically model this
formalism by using a new conditional U-Net architecture, which fully takes into
account the conditional information and does not need any fixed image. Our
formalism is then applied to image moving tumors for radiotherapy treatment at
different breathing amplitude using 4D-CT (3D+t) scans in thoracoabdominal
regions. This driving application is particularly complex as it requires to
stitch a collection of sequential 2D slices into several 3D volumes at
different organ positions. Movement interpolation with standard methods then
generates well known reconstruction artefacts in the assembled volumes due to
irregular patient breathing, hysteresis and poor correlation of breathing
signal to internal motion. Results obtained on 4D-CT clinical data showcase
artefact-free volumes achieved through real-time latencies. The code is

Conclusion: 少量数据集特定参数能有效解决泛化问题，同时提供对空间显著性特性的深入理解。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-based saliency prediction are approaching gold
standard performance levels on existing benchmarks. Despite this success, we
show that predicting fixations across multiple saliency datasets remains
challenging due to dataset bias. We find a significant performance drop (around
40%) when models trained on one dataset are applied to another. Surprisingly,
increasing dataset diversity does not resolve this inter-dataset gap, with
close to 60% attributed to dataset-specific biases. To address this remaining
generalization gap, we propose a novel architecture extending a mostly
dataset-agnostic encoder-decoder structure with fewer than 20 dataset-specific
parameters that govern interpretable mechanisms such as multi-scale structure,
center bias, and fixation spread. Adapting only these parameters to new data
accounts for more than 75% of the generalization gap, with a large fraction of
the improvement achieved with as few as 50 samples. Our model sets a new
state-of-the-art on all three datasets of the MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark
(MIT300, CAT2000, and COCO-Freeview), even when purely generalizing from
unrelated datasets, but with a substantial boost when adapting to the
respective training datasets. The model also provides valuable insights into
spatial saliency properties, revealing complex multi-scale effects that combine
both absolute and relative sizes.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models are often trained on curated datasets,
leading to performance degradation when deployed in real-world clinical
settings due to mismatches between training and test distributions. While data
augmentation techniques are widely used to address these challenges,
traditional visually consistent augmentation strategies lack the robustness
needed for diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we systematically
evaluate alternative augmentation strategies, focusing on MixUp and Auxiliary
Fourier Augmentation. These methods mitigate the effects of multiple variations
without explicitly targeting specific sources of distribution shifts. We
demonstrate how these techniques significantly improve out-of-distribution
generalization and robustness to imaging variations across a wide range of
transformations in cardiac cine MRI and prostate MRI segmentation. We
quantitatively find that these augmentation methods enhance learned feature
representations by promoting separability and compactness. Additionally, we
highlight how their integration into nnU-Net training pipelines provides an
easy-to-implement, effective solution for enhancing the reliability of medical
segmentation models in real-world applications.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps offer extensive and accurate environmental
information about the driving scene, making them a crucial and essential
element for planning within autonomous driving systems. To avoid extensive
efforts from manual labeling, methods for automating the map creation have
emerged. Recent trends have moved from offline mapping to online mapping,
ensuring availability and actuality of the utilized maps. While the performance
has increased in recent years, online mapping still faces challenges regarding
temporal consistency, sensor occlusion, runtime, and generalization. We propose
a novel offline mapping approach that integrates trails - informal routes used
by drivers - into the map creation process. Our method aggregates trail data
from the ego vehicle and other traffic participants to construct a
comprehensive global map using transformer-based deep learning models. Unlike
traditional offline mapping, our approach enables continuous updates while
remaining sensor-agnostic, facilitating efficient data transfer. Our method
demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art online mapping
approaches, achieving improved generalization to previously unseen environments
and sensor configurations. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets,
highlighting its robustness and applicability in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Fingerspelling is a significant component of Sign Language (SL), allowing the

signing. Although previous works on fingerspelling recognition have focused on
processing the temporal dimension of videos, there remains room for improving
the accuracy of these approaches. This paper introduces HandReader, a group of
three architectures designed to address the fingerspelling recognition task.
HandReader$_{RGB}$ employs the novel Temporal Shift-Adaptive Module (TSAM) to
process RGB features from videos of varying lengths while preserving important
sequential information. HandReader$_{KP}$ is built on the proposed Temporal
Pose Encoder (TPE) operated on keypoints as tensors. Such keypoints composition
in a batch allows the encoder to pass them through 2D and 3D convolution
layers, utilizing temporal and spatial information and accumulating keypoints
coordinates. We also introduce HandReader_RGB+KP - architecture with a joint
encoder to benefit from RGB and keypoint modalities. Each HandReader model
possesses distinct advantages and achieves state-of-the-art results on the
ChicagoFSWild and ChicagoFSWild+ datasets. Moreover, the models demonstrate
high performance on the first open dataset for Russian fingerspelling, Znaki,
presented in this paper. The Znaki dataset and HandReader pre-trained models

Abstract: Histopathological analysis is a cornerstone of cancer diagnosis, with
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining routinely acquired for every patient to
visualize cell morphology and tissue architecture. On the other hand, multiplex
immunofluorescence (mIF) enables more precise cell type identification via
proteomic markers, but has yet to achieve widespread clinical adoption due to
cost and logistical constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce MIPHEI
(Multiplex Immunofluorescence Prediction from H&E), a U-Net-inspired
architecture that integrates state-of-the-art ViT foundation models as encoders
to predict mIF signals from H&E images. MIPHEI targets a comprehensive panel of
markers spanning nuclear content, immune lineages (T cells, B cells, myeloid),
epithelium, stroma, vasculature, and proliferation. We train our model using
the publicly available ORION dataset of restained H&E and mIF images from
colorectal cancer tissue, and validate it on two independent datasets. MIPHEI
achieves accurate cell-type classification from H&E alone, with F1 scores of
0.88 for Pan-CK, 0.57 for CD3e, 0.56 for SMA, 0.36 for CD68, and 0.30 for CD20,
substantially outperforming both a state-of-the-art baseline and a random
classifier for most markers. Our results indicate that our model effectively
captures the complex relationships between nuclear morphologies in their tissue
context, as visible in H&E images and molecular markers defining specific cell
types. MIPHEI offers a promising step toward enabling cell-type-aware analysis
of large-scale H&E datasets, in view of uncovering relationships between
spatial cellular organization and patient outcomes.

Abstract: To reduce storage and computational costs, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) seeks
to minimize the number of Gaussians used while preserving high rendering
quality, introducing an inherent trade-off between Gaussian quantity and
rendering quality. Existing methods strive for better quantity-quality
performance, but lack the ability for users to intuitively adjust this

optimization method that achieves semantically meaningful and cross-scene
consistent quantity-quality control while maintaining strong quantity-quality
performance. Through a single training run using a fixed setup and a
user-specified hyperparameter reflecting quantity-quality preference, ControlGS
can automatically find desirable quantity-quality trade-off points across
diverse scenes, from compact objects to large outdoor scenes. It also
outperforms baselines by achieving higher rendering quality with fewer
Gaussians, and supports a broad adjustment range with stepless control over the
trade-off.

Abstract: Face recognition has evolved significantly with the advancement of deep
learning techniques, enabling its widespread adoption in various applications
requiring secure authentication. However, this progress has also increased its
exposure to presentation attacks, including face morphing, which poses a
serious security threat by allowing one identity to impersonate another.
Therefore, modern face recognition systems must be robust against such attacks.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach for training deep networks for face
recognition with enhanced robustness to face morphing attacks. Our method
modifies the classification task by introducing a dual-branch classification
strategy that effectively handles the ambiguity in the labeling of face morphs.
This adaptation allows the model to incorporate morph images into the training
process, improving its ability to distinguish them from bona fide samples.
  Our strategy has been validated on public benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing robustness against face morphing attacks.
Furthermore, our approach is universally applicable and can be integrated into
existing face recognition training pipelines to improve classification-based
recognition methods.

Abstract: This work presents Prior Depth Anything, a framework that combines incomplete
but precise metric information in depth measurement with relative but complete
geometric structures in depth prediction, generating accurate, dense, and
detailed metric depth maps for any scene. To this end, we design a
coarse-to-fine pipeline to progressively integrate the two complementary depth
sources. First, we introduce pixel-level metric alignment and distance-aware
weighting to pre-fill diverse metric priors by explicitly using depth
prediction. It effectively narrows the domain gap between prior patterns,
enhancing generalization across varying scenarios. Second, we develop a
conditioned monocular depth estimation (MDE) model to refine the inherent noise
of depth priors. By conditioning on the normalized pre-filled prior and
prediction, the model further implicitly merges the two complementary depth
sources. Our model showcases impressive zero-shot generalization across depth
completion, super-resolution, and inpainting over 7 real-world datasets,
matching or even surpassing previous task-specific methods. More importantly,
it performs well on challenging, unseen mixed priors and enables test-time
improvements by switching prediction models, providing a flexible
accuracy-efficiency trade-off while evolving with advancements in MDE models.

Abstract: Mechanistic, multicellular, agent-based models are commonly used to
investigate tissue, organ, and organism-scale biology at single-cell
resolution. The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework
for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally
expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation
of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated
evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic
nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different
model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work,
we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI
surrogate of a CPM used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. We
describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that
define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this
classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model
surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference
configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational
time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards
the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种名为Reviewer的3D视觉界面，用于改进肌电假肢的模式识别控制，通过实时反馈提升用户与解码器的交互效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着假肢运动复杂性的增加，用户难以生成足够独特的肌电信号模式以实现可靠分类。现有训练方法依赖试错调整，缺乏直观反馈。

Method: 研究通过10次实验，比较了使用Reviewer与传统虚拟手臂可视化在模式识别性能上的差异，评估指标包括任务完成率、路径效率等。

Result: 使用Reviewer的组在任务完成率、路径效率和吞吐量上表现更优，减少了过冲现象。

Conclusion: 3D视觉反馈通过结构化训练显著提升了新手操作者的模式识别控制能力，减少了试错调整的依赖。

Abstract: State-of-the-art upper limb myoelectric prostheses often use pattern
recognition (PR) control systems that translate electromyography (EMG) signals
into desired movements. As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users
often struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable
classification. Existing training typically involves heuristic, trial-and-error
user adjustments to static decoder boundaries. Goal: We introduce the Reviewer,
a 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's
classification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm
behavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual,
data-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder
boundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants
compared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the
Reviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was
assessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and
the control of orientation. Results: Participants trained with the Reviewer
achieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved path
efficiency and throughput compared to the standard visualization group.
Significance: The Reviewer introduces decoder-informed motor training,
facilitating immediate and consistent PR-based myoelectric control
improvements. By iteratively refining control through real-time feedback, this
approach reduces reliance on trial-and-error recalibration, enabling a more
adaptive, self-correcting training framework. Conclusion: The 3D visual
feedback significantly improves PR control in novice operators through
structured training, enabling feedback-driven adaptation and reducing reliance
on extensive heuristic adjustments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ImplicitStainer的新方法，利用局部隐式函数改进图像翻译（虚拟染色），在数据有限的情况下仍能生成高质量结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E染色在病理学中是金标准，但缺乏分子信息。IHC染色虽能提供额外信息，但获取耗时且仅限专业中心。虚拟染色通过深度学习提供替代方案，但现有方法需大量数据。

Method: ImplicitStainer利用局部隐式函数进行像素级预测，提升虚拟染色性能，减少数据需求。

Result: 在两种数据集上验证，性能优于15种GAN和扩散模型，代码和模型将公开。

Conclusion: ImplicitStainer在数据有限时仍能高效生成高质量虚拟染色结果。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is a gold standard for microscopic
diagnosis in pathology. However, H&E staining does not capture all the
diagnostic information that may be needed. To obtain additional molecular
information, immunohistochemical (IHC) stains highlight proteins that mark
specific cell types, such as CD3 for T-cells or CK8/18 for epithelial cells.
While IHC stains are vital for prognosis and treatment guidance, they are
typically only available at specialized centers and time consuming to acquire,
leading to treatment delays for patients. Virtual staining, enabled by deep
learning-based image translation models, provides a promising alternative by
computationally generating IHC stains from H&E stained images. Although many
GAN and diffusion based image to image (I2I) translation methods have been used
for virtual staining, these models treat image patches as independent data
points, which results in increased and more diverse data requirements for
effective generation. We present ImplicitStainer, a novel approach that
leverages local implicit functions to improve image translation, specifically
virtual staining performance, by focusing on pixel-level predictions. This
method enhances robustness to variations in dataset sizes, delivering
high-quality results even with limited data. We validate our approach on two
datasets using a comprehensive set of metrics and benchmark it against over
fifteen state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion based models. Full Code and models
trained will be released publicly via Github upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图CT重建中，扩散模型直接应用于未处理数据时学习效果差且细节丢失严重，需改进。

Method: 将CT投影数据分为等量子集，采用多子集扩散模型（MSDM）独立学习，并结合全数据扩散模型（OWDM）作为全局约束。

Result: OSMM在图像质量和噪声鲁棒性上优于传统扩散模型，适应性强。

Conclusion: OSMM为稀疏视图CT提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have shown significant promise in the field of
sparse-view CT reconstruction. However, the projection dataset is large and
riddled with redundancy. Consequently, applying the diffusion model to
unprocessed data results in lower learning effectiveness and higher learning
difficulty, frequently leading to reconstructed images that lack fine details.
To address these issues, we propose the ordered-subsets multi-diffusion model
(OSMM) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. The OSMM innovatively divides the CT
projection data into equal subsets and employs multi-subsets diffusion model
(MSDM) to learn from each subset independently. This targeted learning approach
reduces complexity and enhances the reconstruction of fine details.
Furthermore, the integration of one-whole diffusion model (OWDM) with complete
sinogram data acts as a global information constraint, which can reduce the
possibility of generating erroneous or inconsistent sinogram information.
Moreover, the OSMM's unsupervised learning framework provides strong robustness
and generalizability, adapting seamlessly to varying sparsity levels of CT
sinograms. This ensures consistent and reliable performance across different
clinical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OSMM outperforms
traditional diffusion models in terms of image quality and noise resilience,
offering a powerful and versatile solution for advanced CT imaging in
sparse-view scenarios.

Result: VRSplat在用户研究中表现优越，支持现代VR应用，达到72+ FPS，消除了伪影和失真。

Conclusion: VRSplat是首个经过系统评估的3DGS方法，能够有效支持VR应用。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly become a leading technique for
novel-view synthesis, providing exceptional performance through efficient
software-based GPU rasterization. Its versatility enables real-time
applications, including on mobile and lower-powered devices. However, 3DGS
faces key challenges in virtual reality (VR): (1) temporal artifacts, such as
popping during head movements, (2) projection-based distortions that result in
disturbing and view-inconsistent floaters, and (3) reduced framerates when
rendering large numbers of Gaussians, falling below the critical threshold for
VR. Compared to desktop environments, these issues are drastically amplified by
large field-of-view, constant head movements, and high resolution of
head-mounted displays (HMDs). In this work, we introduce VRSplat: we combine
and extend several recent advancements in 3DGS to address challenges of VR
holistically. We show how the ideas of Mini-Splatting, StopThePop, and Optimal
Projection can complement each other, by modifying the individual techniques
and core 3DGS rasterizer. Additionally, we propose an efficient foveated
rasterizer that handles focus and peripheral areas in a single GPU launch,
avoiding redundant computations and improving GPU utilization. Our method also
incorporates a fine-tuning step that optimizes Gaussian parameters based on
StopThePop depth evaluations and Optimal Projection. We validate our method
through a controlled user study with 25 participants, showing a strong
preference for VRSplat over other configurations of Mini-Splatting. VRSplat is
the first, systematically evaluated 3DGS approach capable of supporting modern
VR applications, achieving 72+ FPS while eliminating popping and
stereo-disrupting floaters.

Abstract: In the realm of Human Activity Recognition (HAR), obtaining high quality and
variance data is still a persistent challenge due to high costs and the
inherent variability of real-world activities. This study introduces a
generation dataset by deep learning approaches (Attention Autoencoder and
conditional Generative Adversarial Networks). Another problem that data
heterogeneity is a critical challenge, one of the solutions is to shuffle the
data to homogenize the distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the
random sequence strategy significantly improves classification performance,
achieving an accuracy of up to 0.70 $\pm$ 0.03 and a macro F1 score of 0.64
$\pm$ 0.01. For that, disrupting temporal dependencies through random sequence
reordering compels the model to focus on instantaneous recognition, thereby
improving robustness against activity transitions. This approach not only
broadens the effective training dataset but also offers promising avenues for
enhancing HAR systems in complex, real-world scenarios.

Result: 在GCM 2025和BraTS 2021数据集上，Dice分数提升1.68%，且保持稳健性。

Conclusion: HWA-UNETR和GCM 2025为胃癌多模态分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in the
context of gastric cancer lesion analysis. This clinical context is defined by
the scarcity of independent multimodal datasets and the imperative to
amalgamate inherently misaligned modalities. As a result, algorithms are
constrained to train on approximate data and depend on application migration,
leading to substantial resource expenditure and a potential decline in analysis
accuracy. To address those challenges, we have made two major contributions:
First, we publicly disseminate the GCM 2025 dataset, which serves as the first
large-scale, open-source collection of gastric cancer multimodal MRI scans,
featuring professionally annotated FS-T2W, CE-T1W, and ADC images from 500
patients. Second, we introduce HWA-UNETR, a novel 3D segmentation framework
that employs an original HWA block with learnable window aggregation layers to
establish dynamic feature correspondences between different modalities'
anatomical structures, and leverages the innovative tri-orientated fusion mamba
mechanism for context modeling and capturing long-range spatial dependencies.
Extensive experiments on our GCM 2025 dataset and the publicly BraTS 2021
dataset validate the performance of our framework, demonstrating that the new
approach surpasses existing methods by up to 1.68\% in the Dice score while
maintaining solid robustness. The dataset and code are public via

Conclusion: MLE作为一种新型临床工具，有望显著改善胃肠道成像。

Abstract: White light endoscopy is the clinical gold standard for detecting diseases in
the gastrointestinal tract. Most applications involve identifying visual
abnormalities in tissue color, texture, and shape. Unfortunately, the contrast
of these features is often subtle, causing many clinically relevant cases to go
undetected. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Multi-contrast Laser
Endoscopy (MLE): a platform for widefield clinical imaging with rapidly tunable
spectral, coherent, and directional illumination. We demonstrate three
capabilities of MLE: enhancing tissue chromophore contrast with multispectral
diffuse reflectance, quantifying blood flow using laser speckle contrast
imaging, and characterizing mucosal topography using photometric stereo. We
validate MLE with benchtop models, then demonstrate MLE in vivo during clinical
colonoscopies. MLE images from 31 polyps demonstrate an approximate three-fold
improvement in contrast and a five-fold improvement in color difference
compared to white light and narrow band imaging. With the ability to reveal
multiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating
into the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to
improve gastrointestinal imaging.

Abstract: The recently developed Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have shown encouraging and impressive results for visual SLAM.
However, most representative methods require RGBD sensors and are only
available for indoor environments. The robustness of reconstruction in
large-scale outdoor scenarios remains unexplored. This paper introduces a
large-scale 3DGS-based visual SLAM with stereo cameras, termed LSG-SLAM. The
proposed LSG-SLAM employs a multi-modality strategy to estimate prior poses
under large view changes. In tracking, we introduce feature-alignment warping
constraints to alleviate the adverse effects of appearance similarity in
rendering losses. For the scalability of large-scale scenarios, we introduce
continuous Gaussian Splatting submaps to tackle unbounded scenes with limited
memory. Loops are detected between GS submaps by place recognition and the
relative pose between looped keyframes is optimized utilizing rendering and
feature warping losses. After the global optimization of camera poses and
Gaussian points, a structure refinement module enhances the reconstruction
quality. With extensive evaluations on the EuRoc and KITTI datasets, LSG-SLAM
achieves superior performance over existing Neural, 3DGS-based, and even
traditional approaches. Project page: https://lsg-slam.github.io.

Abstract: With the increasing exploration and exploitation of the underwater world,
underwater images have become a critical medium for human interaction with
marine environments, driving extensive research into their efficient
transmission and storage. However, contemporary underwater image compression
algorithms fail to fully leverage the unique characteristics distinguishing
underwater scenes from terrestrial images, resulting in suboptimal performance.
To address this limitation, we introduce HQUIC, designed to exploit
underwater-image-specific features for enhanced compression efficiency. HQUIC
employs an ALTC module to adaptively predict the attenuation coefficients and
global light information of the images, which effectively mitigates the issues
caused by the differences in lighting and tone existing in underwater images.
Subsequently, HQUIC employs a codebook as an auxiliary branch to extract the
common objects within underwater images and enhances the performance of the
main branch. Furthermore, HQUIC dynamically weights multi-scale frequency
components, prioritizing information critical for distortion quality while
discarding redundant details. Extensive evaluations on diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate that HQUIC outperforms state-of-the-art compression

Abstract: The introduction of 3D Gaussian blendshapes has enabled the real-time

StyleGAN-based framework, has become widely used for facial image stylization.
To extend Toonify for synthesizing diverse stylized 3D head avatars using
Gaussian blendshapes, we propose an efficient two-stage framework, ToonifyGB.
In Stage 1 (stylized video generation), we employ an improved StyleGAN to
generate the stylized video from the input video frames, which addresses the
limitation of cropping aligned faces at a fixed resolution as preprocessing for
normal StyleGAN. This process provides a more stable video, which enables
Gaussian blendshapes to better capture the high-frequency details of the video
frames, and efficiently generate high-quality animation in the next stage. In
Stage 2 (Gaussian blendshapes synthesis), we learn a stylized neutral head
model and a set of expression blendshapes from the generated video. By
combining the neutral head model with expression blendshapes, ToonifyGB can
efficiently render stylized avatars with arbitrary expressions. We validate the
effectiveness of ToonifyGB on the benchmark dataset using two styles: Arcane
and Pixar.

Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) from a single image is inherently ill-posed due to
depth ambiguity and occlusions. Probabilistic methods have tried to solve this

exhibit misalignment with 2D image observations and weak robustness to
in-the-wild images. To address these issues, we propose ADHMR, a framework that
Aligns a Diffusion-based HMR model in a preference optimization manner. First,
we train a human mesh prediction assessment model, HMR-Scorer, capable of
evaluating predictions even for in-the-wild images without 3D annotations. We
then use HMR-Scorer to create a preference dataset, where each input image has
a pair of winner and loser mesh predictions. This dataset is used to finetune
the base model using direct preference optimization. Moreover, HMR-Scorer also
helps improve existing HMR models by data cleaning, even with fewer training
samples. Extensive experiments show that ADHMR outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at:

Abstract: The Image Signal Processor (ISP) is a fundamental component in modern
smartphone cameras responsible for conversion of RAW sensor image data to RGB
images with a strong focus on perceptual quality. Recent work highlights the
potential of deep learning approaches and their ability to capture details with
a quality increasingly close to that of professional cameras. A difficult and
costly step when developing a learned ISP is the acquisition of pixel-wise
aligned paired data that maps the raw captured by a smartphone camera sensor to
high-quality reference images. In this work, we address this challenge by
proposing a novel training method for a learnable ISP that eliminates the need
for direct correspondences between raw images and ground-truth data with
matching content. Our unpaired approach employs a multi-term loss function
guided by adversarial training with multiple discriminators processing feature
maps from pre-trained networks to maintain content structure while learning
color and texture characteristics from the target RGB dataset. Using
lightweight neural network architectures suitable for mobile devices as
backbones, we evaluated our method on the Zurich RAW to RGB and Fujifilm
UltraISP datasets. Compared to paired training methods, our unpaired learning
strategy shows strong potential and achieves high fidelity across multiple

Motivation: 椰树疾病对农业产量构成严重威胁，尤其是在发展中国家，传统方法难以实现早期诊断和干预。

Method: 采用深度学习模型DeepSeqCoco，测试了多种优化器设置（如SGD、Adam及混合配置），以平衡准确性、损失最小化和计算成本。

Result: 模型在混合SGD-Adam优化器下表现最佳，验证损失为2.81%，准确率提高5%，训练和预测时间分别减少18%和85%。

Abstract: Coconut tree diseases are a serious risk to agricultural yield, particularly
in developing countries where conventional farming practices restrict early
diagnosis and intervention. Current disease identification methods are manual,
labor-intensive, and non-scalable. In response to these limitations, we come up
with DeepSeqCoco, a deep learning based model for accurate and automatic
disease identification from coconut tree images. The model was tested under
various optimizer settings, such as SGD, Adam, and hybrid configurations, to
identify the optimal balance between accuracy, minimization of loss, and
computational cost. Results from experiments indicate that DeepSeqCoco can
achieve as much as 99.5% accuracy (achieving up to 5% higher accuracy than
existing models) with the hybrid SGD-Adam showing the lowest validation loss of
2.81%. It also shows a drop of up to 18% in training time and up to 85% in
prediction time for input images. The results point out the promise of the
model to improve precision agriculture through an AI-based, scalable, and
efficient disease monitoring system.

Abstract: Accurate food volume estimation is crucial for medical nutrition management
and health monitoring applications, but current food volume estimation methods
are often limited by mononuclear data, leveraging single-purpose hardware such
as 3D scanners, gathering sensor-oriented information such as depth
information, or relying on camera calibration using a reference object. In this
paper, we present VolE, a novel framework that leverages mobile device-driven
3D reconstruction to estimate food volume. VolE captures images and camera
locations in free motion to generate precise 3D models, thanks to AR-capable
mobile devices. To achieve real-world measurement, VolE is a reference- and
depth-free framework that leverages food video segmentation for food mask
generation. We also introduce a new food dataset encompassing the challenging
scenarios absent in the previous benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
VolE outperforms the existing volume estimation techniques across multiple
datasets by achieving 2.22 % MAPE, highlighting its superior performance in
food volume estimation.

Abstract: The left atrium (LA) plays a pivotal role in modulating left ventricular
filling, but our comprehension of its hemodynamics is significantly limited by
the constraints of conventional ultrasound analysis. 4D flow magnetic resonance
imaging (4D Flow MRI) holds promise for enhancing our understanding of atrial
hemodynamics. However, the low velocities within the LA and the limited spatial
resolution of 4D Flow MRI make analyzing this chamber challenging. Furthermore,
the absence of dedicated computational frameworks, combined with diverse
acquisition protocols and vendors, complicates gathering large cohorts for
studying the prognostic value of hemodynamic parameters provided by 4D Flow
MRI. In this study, we introduce the first open-source computational framework
tailored for the analysis of 4D Flow MRI in the LA, enabling comprehensive
qualitative and quantitative analysis of advanced hemodynamic parameters. Our
framework proves robust to data from different centers of varying quality,
producing high-accuracy automated segmentations (Dice $>$ 0.9 and Hausdorff 95

first comprehensive assessment of energy, vorticity, and pressure parameters in
the LA across a spectrum of disorders to investigate their potential as

Motivation: 提升LLM在代理系统中的推理和行动能力，尤其是针对复杂任务和多步执行场景，同时解决小模型在推理任务中的局限性。

Method: 提出Pre-Act方法，生成多步执行计划和详细推理，逐步优化响应；设计两级评估框架（轮次和端到端）；对小模型（如Llama 3.1）进行微调。

Result: Pre-Act在Almita数据集上比ReAct在动作召回率上提升70%；微调后的70B模型在动作准确率和目标完成率上分别比GPT-4提升69.5%和28%。

Conclusion: Pre-Act显著提升代理性能，尤其在复杂推理任务中，且通过微调小模型可解决实际应用中的成本与延迟问题。

Abstract: The ReAct (Reasoning + Action) capability in large language models (LLMs) has
become the foundation of modern agentic systems. Recent LLMs, such as
DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1/o3, exemplify this by emphasizing reasoning through
the generation of ample intermediate tokens, which help build a strong premise
before producing the final output tokens. In this paper, we introduce Pre-Act,
a novel approach that enhances the agent's performance by creating a multi-step
execution plan along with the detailed reasoning for the given user input. This
plan incrementally incorporates previous steps and tool outputs, refining
itself after each step execution until the final response is obtained. Our
approach is applicable to both conversational and non-conversational agents. To
measure the performance of task-oriented agents comprehensively, we propose a
two-level evaluation framework: (1) turn level and (2) end-to-end. Our
turn-level evaluation, averaged across five models, shows that our approach,
Pre-Act, outperforms ReAct by 70% in Action Recall on the Almita dataset. While
this approach is effective for larger models, smaller models crucial for
practical applications, where latency and cost are key constraints, often
struggle with complex reasoning tasks required for agentic systems. To address
this limitation, we fine-tune relatively small models such as Llama 3.1 (8B &
70B) using the proposed Pre-Act approach. Our experiments show that the
fine-tuned 70B model outperforms GPT-4, achieving a 69.5% improvement in action
accuracy (turn-level) and a 28% improvement in goal completion rate
(end-to-end) on the Almita (out-of-domain) dataset.

Result: 大多数LLMs在常识能力上低于人类中位数，且与人类相关性有限；小型开源模型表现优于大型专有模型。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁AI模型需适应不同文化背景的人类群体，强调了常识评估的文化基础。

Abstract: Commonsense intelligence in machines is often assessed by static benchmarks
that compare a model's output against human-prescribed correct labels. An
important, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately
capture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as
homogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary
enormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident
to one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a novel
method for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI),
specifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically
observed heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a
model's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when
treated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human
median in their individual commonsense competence. Second, when used as
simulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only
modestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In
both cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than
larger, proprietary frontier models. Our evaluation framework, which ties
commonsense intelligence to its cultural basis, contributes to the growing call
for adapting AI models to human collectivities that possess different, often
incompatible, social stocks of knowledge.

Abstract: There can be many competing and contradictory explanations for a single model

the limitations of these approaches, and propose three desirable principles to
ground the future development of explanation evaluation strategies for local
feature importance explanations. We propose a ground-truth Agnostic eXplanation
Evaluation framework (AXE) for evaluating and comparing model explanations that
satisfies these principles. Unlike prior approaches, AXE does not require
access to ideal ground-truth explanations for comparison, or rely on model
sensitivity - providing an independent measure of explanation quality. We
verify AXE by comparing with baselines, and show how it can be used to detect
explanation fairwashing. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在动态环境中的推理能力有限，需超越静态基准以全面评估其复杂性。

Abstract: While large language models demonstrate impressive performance on static
benchmarks, the true potential of large language models as self-learning and
reasoning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. This study
systematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation,
and planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of
agents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in
dynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller
ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a
too-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks,
while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting
techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less
improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find
that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable
of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making
align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops.
Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true
emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits
persistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and
spatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models
still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through
self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while
reasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math
word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important
shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move
beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into cyber security

Applications framework, we assessed seven open-source LLMs: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B,
Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B.
Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all
tested LLMs (e.g., the safety score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection
drops from 0.95 to 0.15). We propose and evaluate a safety alignment approach
that carefully rewords instruction-response pairs to include explicit safety
precautions and ethical considerations. This approach demonstrates that it is
possible to maintain or even improve model safety while preserving technical
utility, offering a practical path forward for developing safer fine-tuning
methodologies. This work offers a systematic evaluation for safety risks in
LLMs, enabling safer adoption of generative AI in sensitive domains, and
contributing towards the development of secure, trustworthy, and ethically

Result: 部分LLMs（如Llama3.2）在高达61%的情况下基于错误逻辑得出正确答案，且对代码变异的预测稳定性较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在代码理解中的推理能力和鲁棒性仍有不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Understanding the reasoning and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for their reliable use in programming tasks. While recent studies have
assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the
accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them.
Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can
arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar
issues in code understanding.
  In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B
parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply
five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring
comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to
while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while
altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert
analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are
based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across
different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that
some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed
reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in
response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic
understanding.

Abstract: Foundation models can provide robust high-level reasoning on appropriate
safety interventions in hazardous scenarios beyond a robot's training data,
i.e. out-of-distribution (OOD) failures. However, due to the high inference
latency of Large Vision and Language Models, current methods rely on manually
defined intervention policies to enact fallbacks, thereby lacking the ability
to plan generalizable, semantically safe motions. To overcome these challenges
we present FORTRESS, a framework that generates and reasons about semantically
safe fallback strategies in real time to prevent OOD failures. At a low
frequency in nominal operations, FORTRESS uses multi-modal reasoners to
identify goals and anticipate failure modes. When a runtime monitor triggers a
fallback response, FORTRESS rapidly synthesizes plans to fallback goals while
inferring and avoiding semantically unsafe regions in real time. By bridging
open-world, multi-modal reasoning with dynamics-aware planning, we eliminate
the need for hard-coded fallbacks and human safety interventions. FORTRESS
outperforms on-the-fly prompting of slow reasoning models in safety
classification accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and real-world ANYmal robot
data, and further improves system safety and planning success in simulation and
on quadrotor hardware for urban navigation.

Conclusion: Graph RAG通过个性化学习体验提升了MOOCs中知识获取的效果。

Abstract: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) lack direct interaction between learners
and instructors, making it challenging for learners to understand new knowledge
concepts. Recently, learners have increasingly used Large Language Models
(LLMs) to support them in acquiring new knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to
hallucinations which limits their reliability. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving relevant documents before generating a
response. However, the application of RAG across different MOOCs is limited by
unstructured learning material. Furthermore, current RAG systems do not
actively guide learners toward their learning needs. To address these
challenges, we propose a Graph RAG pipeline that leverages Educational
Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) and Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) to guide
learners to understand knowledge concepts in the MOOC platform CourseMapper.
Specifically, we implement (1) a PKG-based Question Generation method to
recommend personalized questions for learners in context, and (2) an
EduKG-based Question Answering method that leverages the relationships between
knowledge concepts in the EduKG to answer learner selected questions. To
evaluate both methods, we conducted a study with 3 expert instructors on 3
different MOOCs in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. The results of the
evaluation show the potential of Graph RAG to empower learners to understand
new knowledge concepts in a personalized learning experience.

Abstract: Under the slogan of trustworthy AI, much of contemporary AI research is

system may not be convinced by AI system design alone -- neither should they,
if the AI system is embedded in a social context that gives good reason to
believe that it is used in tension with a person's interest. In such cases,
distrust in the system may be justified and necessary to build meaningful trust
in the first place. We propose the term "healthy distrust" to describe such a
justified, careful stance towards certain AI usage practices. We investigate
prior notions of trust and distrust in computer science, sociology, history,
psychology, and philosophy, outline a remaining gap that healthy distrust might

Conclusion: 结论指出LLMs确实记忆了公开数据集，这需要引起研究社区的关注。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to
recommendation scenarios due to their remarkable natural language understanding
and generation capabilities. Although significant research has explored the use
of LLMs for various recommendation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to
verifying whether they have memorized public recommendation dataset as part of
their training data. This is undesirable because memorization reduces the
generalizability of research findings, as benchmarking on memorized datasets
does not guarantee generalization to unseen datasets. Furthermore, memorization
can amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more
frequently than others.
  In this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public
recommendation datasets. Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and
Llama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset
in recommender systems: MovieLens-1M. First, we define dataset memorization as
the extent to which item attributes, user profiles, and user-item interactions
can be retrieved by prompting the LLMs. Second, we analyze the impact of
memorization on recommendation performance. Lastly, we examine whether
memorization varies across model families and model sizes. Our results reveal
that all models exhibit some degree of memorization of MovieLens-1M, and that
recommendation performance is related to the extent of memorization. We have

AI agents of today. We argue that these agents, exemplified by systems like
OpenAI's ChatGPT with plugins and xAI's Grok, represent a culminating phase in
AI development, potentially constituting the "final generation" of intelligence
as we currently conceive it. We explore the capabilities and underlying
technologies of these agents, grounded in practical examples, while also
examining the profound societal implications and the unprecedented pace of
progress that suggests intelligence is now doubling approximately every six
months. The paper concludes by underscoring the critical need for wisdom and
foresight in navigating the opportunities and challenges presented by this
powerful new era of intelligence.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的多智能体方法局限于纯模拟或固定工作流，限制了其适用性和效果。

Method: MASS通过逐步增加智能体数量进行大规模模拟，并通过反向优化过程端到端优化智能体分布。

Result: 在3个A股股票池上与6个基线方法对比，MASS在性能、鲁棒性和扩展性上表现优越。

Conclusion: MASS范式可扩展至其他类似任务，其实现已开源。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent has gained significant attention for their potential in
simulation and enhancing performance. However, existing works are limited to
pure simulations or are constrained by predefined workflows, restricting their
applicability and effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Agent
Scaling Simulation (MASS) for portfolio construction. MASS achieves stable and
continuous excess returns by progressively increasing the number of agents for
large-scale simulations to gain a superior understanding of the market and
optimizing agent distribution end-to-end through a reverse optimization
process, rather than relying on a fixed workflow. We demonstrate its
superiority through performance experiments, ablation studies, backtesting
experiments, experiments on updated data and stock pools, scaling experiments,
parameter sensitivity experiments, and visualization experiments, conducted in
comparison with 6 state-of-the-art baselines on 3 challenging A-share stock
pools. We expect the paradigm established by MASS to expand to other tasks with
similar characteristics. The implementation of MASS has been open-sourced at

Conclusion: 为AI Agents和Agentic AI系统的开发提供了明确的指导。

Abstract: This study critically distinguishes between AI Agents and Agentic AI,
offering a structured conceptual taxonomy, application mapping, and challenge
analysis to clarify their divergent design philosophies and capabilities. We
begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions,
characterizing AI Agents as modular systems driven by Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Large Image Models (LIMs) for narrow, task-specific automation.
Generative AI is positioned as a precursor, with AI Agents advancing through
tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. In contrast,
Agentic AI systems represent a paradigmatic shift marked by multi-agent
collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and orchestrated
autonomy. Through a sequential evaluation of architectural evolution,
operational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a
comparative analysis across both paradigms. Application domains such as
customer support, scheduling, and data summarization are contrasted with
Agentic AI deployments in research automation, robotic coordination, and
medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in each paradigm
including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination
failure and propose targeted solutions such as ReAct loops, RAG, orchestration
layers, and causal modeling. This work aims to provide a definitive roadmap for
developing robust, scalable, and explainable AI agent and Agentic AI-driven
systems. >AI Agents, Agent-driven, Vision-Language-Models, Agentic AI Decision

Abstract: The recent trend of self-sovereign Decentralized AI Agents (DeAgents)
combines Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI agents with decentralization
technologies such as blockchain smart contracts and trusted execution
environments (TEEs). These tamper-resistant trustless substrates allow agents
to achieve self-sovereignty through ownership of cryptowallet private keys and
control of digital assets and social media accounts. DeAgent eliminates
centralized control and reduces human intervention, addressing key trust
concerns inherent in centralized AI systems. However, given ongoing challenges
in LLM reliability such as hallucinations, this creates paradoxical tension
between trustlessness and unreliable autonomy. This study addresses this
empirical research gap through interviews with DeAgents stakeholders-experts,
founders, and developers-to examine their motivations, benefits, and governance
dilemmas. The findings will guide future DeAgents system and protocol design
and inform discussions about governance in sociotechnical AI systems in the

Abstract: Responsible AI (RAI) efforts increasingly emphasize the importance of
addressing potential harms early in the AI development lifecycle through
social-technical lenses. However, in cross-functional industry teams, this work
is often stalled by a persistent knowledge handoff challenge: the difficulty of
transferring high-level, early-stage technical design rationales from technical
experts to non-technical or user-facing roles for ethical evaluation and harm
identification. Through literature review and a co-design study with 8
practitioners, we unpack how this challenge manifests -- technical design
choices are rarely handed off in ways that support meaningful engagement by
non-technical roles; collaborative workflows lack shared, visual structures to
support mutual understanding; and non-technical practitioners are left without
scaffolds for systematic harm evaluation. Existing tools like JIRA or Google
Docs, while useful for product tracking, are ill-suited for supporting joint
harm identification across roles, often requiring significant extra effort to
align understanding. To address this, we developed AI LEGO, a web-based
prototype that supports cross-functional AI practitioners in effectively
facilitating knowledge handoff and identifying harmful design choices in the
early design stages. Technical roles use interactive blocks to draft
development plans, while non-technical roles engage with those blocks through
stage-specific checklists and LLM-driven persona simulations to surface
potential harms. In a study with 18 cross-functional practitioners, AI LEGO
increased the volume and likelihood of harms identified compared to baseline
worksheets. Participants found that its modular structure and persona prompts
made harm identification more accessible, fostering clearer and more
collaborative RAI practices in early design.

Result: KCAC在训练时间减少40%的同时，任务成功率提高了10%。

Conclusion: KCAC为基于课程的RL框架提供了设计指导，提升了机器人学习的效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic
manipulation but faces challenges in sample inefficiency and lack of
interpretability, limiting its applicability in real world scenarios. Enabling
the agent to gain a deeper understanding and adapt more efficiently to diverse
working scenarios is crucial, and strategic knowledge utilization is a key
factor in this process. This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation,
and Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer
into RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two
block stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic
manipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to
solve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In
this work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid
constraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards
concurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two
self-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to
facilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40
percent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10
percent compared to traditional RL methods. Through extensive evaluation, we
identify key curriculum design parameters subtask selection, transition timing,
and learning rate that optimize learning efficiency and provide conceptual
guidance for curriculum based RL frameworks. This work offers valuable insights
into curriculum design in RL and robotic learning.

Abstract: Given a classification model and a prediction for some input, there are
heuristic strategies for ranking features according to their importance in
regard to the prediction. One common approach to this task is rooted in
propositional logic and the notion of \textit{sufficient reason}. Through this
concept, the categories of relevant and necessary features were proposed in
order to identify the crucial aspects of the input. This paper improves the
existing techniques and algorithms for deciding which are the relevant and/or
necessary features, showing in particular that necessity can be detected
efficiently in complex models such as neural networks. We also generalize the
notion of relevancy and study associated problems. Moreover, we present a new
global notion (i.e. that intends to explain whether a feature is important for
the behavior of the model in general, not depending on a particular input) of
\textit{usefulness} and prove that it is related to relevancy and necessity.
Furthermore, we develop efficient algorithms for detecting it in decision trees
and other more complex models, and experiment on three datasets to analyze its
practical utility.

multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation

factual inconsistency, hallucination, and cross-modal misalignment. We propose
a multimodal multi-agent framework for RRG that aligns with the stepwise
clinical reasoning workflow, where task-specific agents handle retrieval, draft
generation, visual analysis, refinement, and synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms a strong baseline in both automatic
metrics and LLM-based evaluations, producing more accurate, structured, and

multi-agent frameworks to support explainable and trustworthy clinical AI
applications.

Conclusion: 可塑性和赋能及其关系是理解代理行为的关键。

Abstract: Agents are minimally entities that are influenced by their past observations
and act to influence future observations. This latter capacity is captured by
empowerment, which has served as a vital framing concept across artificial
intelligence and cognitive science. This former capacity, however, is equally
foundational: In what ways, and to what extent, can an agent be influenced by
what it observes? In this paper, we ground this concept in a universal
agent-centric measure that we refer to as plasticity, and reveal a fundamental
connection to empowerment. Following a set of desiderata on a suitable
definition, we define plasticity using a new information-theoretic quantity we
call the generalized directed information. We show that this new quantity
strictly generalizes the directed information introduced by Massey (1990) while
preserving all of its desirable properties. Our first finding is that
plasticity is the mirror of empowerment: The agent's plasticity is identical to
the empowerment of the environment, and vice versa. Our second finding
establishes a tension between the plasticity and empowerment of an agent,
suggesting that agent design needs to be mindful of both characteristics. We
explore the implications of these findings, and suggest that plasticity,
empowerment, and their relationship are essential to understanding agency.

Conclusion: ManipBench为VLMs的低层推理能力提供了标准化评估，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence and
robotics due to their commonsense reasoning capabilities. In robotic
manipulation, VLMs are used primarily as high-level planners, but recent work
has also studied their lower-level reasoning ability, which refers to making
decisions about precise robot movements. However, the community currently lacks
a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level
reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench,
to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation reasoning capabilities of VLMs
across various dimensions, including how well they understand object-object
interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively test 33
representative VLMs across 10 model families on our benchmark, including
variants to test different model sizes. Our evaluation shows that the
performance of VLMs significantly varies across tasks, and there is a strong
correlation between this performance and trends in our real-world manipulation
tasks. It also shows that there remains a significant gap between these models
and human-level understanding. See our website at:

heterogeneous healthcare data and lack contextual understanding. This study
evaluates Large Language Model (LLM) based clustering against classical methods
using a pediatric sepsis dataset from a low-income country (LIC), containing
2,686 records with 28 numerical and 119 categorical variables. Patient records
were serialized into text with and without a clustering objective. Embeddings
were generated using quantized LLAMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B with
low-rank adaptation(LoRA), and Stella-En-400M-V5 models. K-means clustering was
applied to these embeddings. Classical comparisons included K-Medoids
clustering on UMAP and FAMD-reduced mixed data. Silhouette scores and
statistical tests evaluated cluster quality and distinctiveness.
Stella-En-400M-V5 achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.86). LLAMA 3.1 8B
with the clustering objective performed better with higher number of clusters,
identifying subgroups with distinct nutritional, clinical, and socioeconomic
profiles. LLM-based methods outperformed classical techniques by capturing

requirements, covering critical cases such as equivalence partitions and
boundary values. The strengths and weaknesses of LLMs versus trained
programmers were compared through quantitative metrics and manual qualitative
analysis. The results show that the effectiveness of LLMs depends on
well-designed prompts, robust implementation, and precise requirements.
Although flexible and promising, LLMs still require human supervision. This

Conclusion: 混合Gen-SemCom系统通过CIE框架和GVIF指标，显著提升了通信效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Generative semantic communication (Gen-SemCom) with large artificial
intelligence (AI) model promises a transformative paradigm for 6G networks,
which reduces communication costs by transmitting low-dimensional prompts
rather than raw data. However, purely prompt-driven generation loses
fine-grained visual details. Additionally, there is a lack of systematic
metrics to evaluate the performance of Gen-SemCom systems. To address these
issues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information
embedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical
features are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic
filtering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features
of images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and
critical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a
diffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual
information fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the
generated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features,
the GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted
features and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we
design a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume
of features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental
results validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating
with both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized
system achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of
higher PSNR and lower FID scores.

Abstract: A recent area of increasing research is the use of Large Language Models

external tools and knowledge bases. We conduct a study on three
capture-the-flag style Hack The Box (HTB) machines, comparing our
implementation AutoPentest with the baseline approach of manually using the

We measure a total cost of \$96.20 US when using AutoPentest across all

major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability
detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates,
scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have
driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and
secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new
avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges
for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising
solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight,
interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the
effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and
Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without
fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug
detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned
transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence
that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal
representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific
supervision.

TL;DR: IN-RIL是一种结合模仿学习（IL）和强化学习（RL）的方法，通过交替更新IL和RL来提升策略微调的稳定性和样本效率。

Motivation: 现有方法中，IL预训练后RL微调的两阶段学习范式在微调阶段常面临不稳定和样本效率低的问题。

Method: 提出IN-RIL，通过周期性注入IL更新到RL微调中，并开发梯度分离机制以避免目标冲突。

Result: 在14个机器人任务上的实验表明，IN-RIL显著提高了样本效率并避免了性能崩溃。

Conclusion: IN-RIL作为一种通用插件，能显著提升RL微调效果。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) each offer distinct
advantages for robotics policy learning: IL provides stable learning from
demonstrations, and RL promotes generalization through exploration. While
existing robot learning approaches using IL-based pre-training followed by
RL-based fine-tuning are promising, this two-step learning paradigm often
suffers from instability and poor sample efficiency during the RL fine-tuning
phase. In this work, we introduce IN-RIL, INterleaved Reinforcement learning
and Imitation Learning, for policy fine-tuning, which periodically injects IL
updates after multiple RL updates and hence can benefit from the stability of
IL and the guidance of expert data for more efficient exploration throughout
the entire fine-tuning process. Since IL and RL involve different optimization
objectives, we develop gradient separation mechanisms to prevent destructive
interference during \ABBR fine-tuning, by separating possibly conflicting
gradient updates in orthogonal subspaces. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous
analysis, and our findings shed light on why interleaving IL with RL stabilizes
learning and improves sample-efficiency. Extensive experiments on 14 robot
manipulation and locomotion tasks across 3 benchmarks, including
FurnitureBench, OpenAI Gym, and Robomimic, demonstrate that \ABBR can
significantly improve sample efficiency and mitigate performance collapse
during online finetuning in both long- and short-horizon tasks with either
sparse or dense rewards. IN-RIL, as a general plug-in compatible with various
state-of-the-art RL algorithms, can significantly improve RL fine-tuning, e.g.,
from 12\% to 88\% with 6.3x improvement in the success rate on Robomimic
Transport. Project page: https://github.com/ucd-dare/IN-RIL.

Abstract: Understanding an agent's intent through its behavior is essential in
human-robot interaction, interactive AI systems, and multi-agent
collaborations. This task, known as Goal Recognition (GR), poses significant
challenges in dynamic environments where goals are numerous and constantly
evolving. Traditional GR methods, designed for a predefined set of goals, often
struggle to adapt to these dynamic scenarios. To address this limitation, we
introduce the General Dynamic GR problem - a broader definition of GR - aimed
at enabling real-time GR systems and fostering further research in this area.
Expanding on this foundation, this paper employs a model-free goal-conditioned
RL approach to enable fast adaptation for GR across various changing tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in lung pathology detection from
chest X-rays, but widespread clinical adoption remains limited due to opaque
model decision-making. In prior work, we introduced ClinicXAI, a human-centric,
expert-guided concept bottleneck model (CBM) designed for interpretable lung
cancer diagnosis. We now extend that approach and present XpertXAI, a
generalizable expert-driven model that preserves human-interpretable clinical
concepts while scaling to detect multiple lung pathologies. Using a
high-performing InceptionV3-based classifier and a public dataset of chest
X-rays with radiology reports, we compare XpertXAI against leading post-hoc
explainability methods and an unsupervised CBM, XCBs. We assess explanations
through comparison with expert radiologist annotations and medical ground
truth. Although XpertXAI is trained for multiple pathologies, our expert
validation focuses on lung cancer. We find that existing techniques frequently
fail to produce clinically meaningful explanations, omitting key diagnostic
features and disagreeing with radiologist judgments. XpertXAI not only
outperforms these baselines in predictive accuracy but also delivers
concept-level explanations that better align with expert reasoning. While our
focus remains on explainability in lung cancer detection, this work illustrates
how human-centric model design can be effectively extended to broader
diagnostic contexts - offering a scalable path toward clinically meaningful
explainable AI in medical diagnostics.

Abstract: As the field of healthcare increasingly adopts artificial intelligence, it
becomes important to understand which types of explanations increase
transparency and empower users to develop confidence and trust in the
predictions made by machine learning (ML) systems. In shared decision-making
scenarios where doctors cooperate with ML systems to reach an appropriate

different approaches to generating explanations in eXplainable AI (XAI) and
make their underlying arguments explicit so that they can be evaluated by
medical experts. In particular, we present the findings of a user study
conducted with physicians to investigate their perceptions of various types of
AI-generated explanations in the context of diagnostic decision support. The

the diagnostic process. In the study, medical doctors filled out a survey to
assess different types of explanations. Further, an interview was carried out
post-survey to gain qualitative insights on the requirements of explanations
incorporated in diagnostic decision support. Overall, the insights gained from
this study contribute to understanding the types of explanations that are most

Conclusion: ChartFinder通过结合丰富的语义见解，显著提升了文本到图表检索的性能，为BI应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Charts are crucial for data analysis and decision-making.Text-to-chart
retrieval systems have become increasingly important for Business Intelligence
(BI), where users need to find relevant charts that match their analytical
needs. These needs can be categorized into precise queries that are
well-specified and fuzzy queries that are more exploratory -- both require
understanding the semantics and context of the charts. However, existing
text-to-chart retrieval solutions often fail to capture the semantic content
and contextual information of charts, primarily due to the lack of
comprehensive metadata (or semantic insights). To address this limitation, we
propose a training data development pipeline that automatically synthesizes
hierarchical semantic insights for charts, covering visual patterns
(visual-oriented), statistical properties (statistics-oriented), and practical
applications (task-oriented), which produces 207,498 semantic insights for
69,166 charts. Based on these, we train a CLIP-based model named ChartFinder to
learn better representations of charts for text-to-chart retrieval. Our method
leverages rich semantic insights during the training phase to develop a model
that understands both visual and semantic aspects of charts.To evaluate
text-to-chart retrieval performance, we curate the first benchmark, CRBench,
for this task with 21,862 charts and 326 text queries from real-world BI
applications, with ground-truth labels verified by the crowd
workers.Experiments show that ChartFinder significantly outperforms existing
methods in text-to-chart retrieval tasks across various settings. For precise
queries, ChartFinder achieves up to 66.9% NDCG@10, which is 11.58% higher than
state-of-the-art models. In fuzzy query tasks, our method also demonstrates
consistent improvements, with an average increase of 5% across nearly all
metrics.

Trained on DROID-3D, EmbodiedMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art

Abstract: Accurate and robust localization is a critical enabler for emerging 5G and 6G
applications, including autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), and smart
manufacturing. While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing
models require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across
deployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations,
we propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless
localization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL)
tasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on
information bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a
pretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model
(LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three
complementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling
(SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii)
position-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly
capture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple
perspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks,
including time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation,
single base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization.
Comprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses
both model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization
tasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer
models without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under
label-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its
potential as a foundation model for wireless localization.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, such as autonomous robots and
intelligent vehicles, are increasingly reliant on diverse heterogeneous
accelerators (e.g., GPGPUs, NPUs, FPGAs) to meet stringent real-time processing
and energy-efficiency demands. However, the proliferation of vendor-specific
proprietary communication libraries creates significant interoperability
barriers, hindering seamless collaboration between different accelerator types
and leading to suboptimal resource utilization and performance bottlenecks in
distributed AI workloads. This paper introduces KAITIAN, a novel distributed
communication framework designed to bridge this gap. KAITIAN provides a unified
abstraction layer that intelligently integrates vendor-optimized communication
libraries for intra-group efficiency with general-purpose communication
protocols for inter-group interoperability. Crucially, it incorporates a
load-adaptive scheduling mechanism that dynamically balances computational
tasks across heterogeneous devices based on their real-time performance
characteristics. Implemented as an extension to PyTorch and rigorously
evaluated on a testbed featuring NVIDIA GPUs and Cambricon MLUs, KAITIAN
demonstrates significant improvements in resource utilization and scalability
for distributed training tasks. Experimental results show that KAITIAN can
accelerate training time by up to 42% compared to baseline homogeneous systems,
while incurring minimal communication overhead (2.8--4.3%) and maintaining
model accuracy. KAITIAN paves the way for more flexible and powerful

Abstract: Vehicle platooning, with vehicles traveling in close formation coordinated
through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, offers significant benefits
in fuel efficiency and road utilization. However, it is vulnerable to
sophisticated falsification attacks by authenticated insiders that can
destabilize the formation and potentially cause catastrophic collisions. This
paper addresses this challenge: misbehavior detection in vehicle platooning
systems. We present AttentionGuard, a transformer-based framework for
misbehavior detection that leverages the self-attention mechanism to identify
anomalous patterns in mobility data. Our proposal employs a multi-head
transformer-encoder to process sequential kinematic information, enabling
effective differentiation between normal mobility patterns and falsification
attacks across diverse platooning scenarios, including steady-state
(no-maneuver) operation, join, and exit maneuvers. Our evaluation uses an
extensive simulation dataset featuring various attack vectors (constant,
gradual, and combined falsifications) and operational parameters (controller
types, vehicle speeds, and attacker positions). Experimental results
demonstrate that AttentionGuard achieves up to 0.95 F1-score in attack
detection, with robust performance maintained during complex maneuvers.
Notably, our system performs effectively with minimal latency (100ms decision
intervals), making it suitable for real-time transportation safety
applications. Comparative analysis reveals superior detection capabilities and
establishes the transformer-encoder as a promising approach for securing
Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) against sophisticated insider
threats.

Abstract: We investigate the efficient learning of magnetic phases using artificial
neural networks trained on synthetic data, combining computational simplicity
with physics-informed strategies. Focusing on the diluted Ising model, which
lacks an exact analytical solution, we explore two complementary approaches: a
supervised classification using simple dense neural networks, and an
unsupervised detection of phase transitions using convolutional autoencoders
trained solely on idealized spin configurations.
  To enhance model performance, we incorporate two key forms of
physics-informed guidance. First, we exploit architectural biases which
preferentially amplify features related to symmetry breaking. Second, we
include training configurations that explicitly break $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry,
reinforcing the network's ability to detect ordered phases. These mechanisms,
acting in tandem, increase the network's sensitivity to phase structure even in
the absence of explicit labels. We validate the machine learning predictions
through comparison with direct numerical estimates of critical temperatures and
percolation thresholds.
  Our results show that synthetic, structured, and computationally efficient
training schemes can reveal physically meaningful phase boundaries, even in
complex systems. This framework offers a low-cost and robust alternative to
conventional methods, with potential applications in broader condensed matter
and statistical physics contexts.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health issue affecting diverse age groups,
with notable prevalence among college students and the elderly. However,
existing datasets and detection methods primarily focus on young adults,
neglecting the broader age spectrum and individual differences that influence
depression manifestation. Current approaches often establish a direct mapping
between multimodal data and depression indicators, failing to capture the
complexity and diversity of depression across individuals. This challenge
includes two tracks based on age-specific subsets: Track 1 uses the
MPDD-Elderly dataset for detecting depression in older adults, and Track 2 uses
the MPDD-Young dataset for detecting depression in younger participants. The
Multimodal Personality-aware Depression Detection (MPDD) Challenge aims to
address this gap by incorporating multimodal data alongside individual
difference factors. We provide a baseline model that fuses audio and video
modalities with individual difference information to detect depression
manifestations in diverse populations. This challenge aims to promote the

Abstract: Taiwanese China Studies (CS) has developed into a rich, interdisciplinary
research field shaped by the unique geopolitical position and long standing
academic engagement with Mainland China. This study responds to the growing
need to systematically revisit and reorganize decades of Taiwan based CS
scholarship by proposing an AI assisted approach that transforms unstructured
academic texts into structured, interactive knowledge representations. We apply
generative AI (GAI) techniques and large language models (LLMs) to extract and
standardize entity relation triples from 1,367 peer reviewed CS articles
published between 1996 and 2019. These triples are then visualized through a
lightweight D3.js based system, forming the foundation of a domain specific
knowledge graph and vector database for the field. This infrastructure allows
users to explore conceptual nodes and semantic relationships across the corpus,
revealing previously uncharted intellectual trajectories, thematic clusters,
and research gaps. By decomposing textual content into graph structured
knowledge units, our system enables a paradigm shift from linear text
consumption to network based knowledge navigation. In doing so, it enhances
scholarly access to CS literature while offering a scalable, data driven
alternative to traditional ontology construction. This work not only
demonstrates how generative AI can augment area studies and digital humanities
but also highlights its potential to support a reimagined scholarly
infrastructure for regional knowledge systems.

Abstract: The effects of personnel scheduling on the quality of care and working
conditions for healthcare personnel have been thoroughly documented. However,
the ever-present demand and large variation of constraints make healthcare
scheduling particularly challenging. This problem has been studied for decades,
with limited research aimed at applying Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT).
SMT has gained momentum within the formal verification community in the last
decades, leading to the advancement of SMT solvers that have been shown to
outperform standard mathematical programming techniques.
  In this work, we propose generic constraint formulations that can model a
wide range of real-world scheduling constraints. Then, the generic constraints
are formulated as SMT and MILP problems and used to compare the respective
state-of-the-art solvers, Z3 and Gurobi, on academic and real-world inspired
rostering problems. Experimental results show how each solver excels for
certain types of problems; the MILP solver generally performs better when the
problem is highly constrained or infeasible, while the SMT solver performs
better otherwise. On real-world inspired problems containing a more varied set
of shifts and personnel, the SMT solver excels. Additionally, it was noted
during experimentation that the SMT solver was more sensitive to the way the
generic constraints were formulated, requiring careful consideration and
experimentation to achieve better performance. We conclude that SMT-based
methods present a promising avenue for future research within the domain of
personnel scheduling.

Abstract: Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) has emerged as a promising treatment
for Parkinson disease (PD). In aDBS, a surgically placed electrode sends
dynamically altered stimuli to the brain based on neurophysiological feedback:
an invasive gadget that limits the amount of data one could collect for
optimizing the control offline. As a consequence, a plethora of synthetic
models of PD and those of the control algorithms have been proposed. Herein, we
introduce the first neurophysiologically realistic benchmark for comparing said
models. Specifically, our methodology covers not only conventional basal
ganglia circuit dynamics and pathological oscillations, but also captures 15
previously dismissed physiological attributes, such as signal instabilities and
noise, neural drift, electrode conductance changes and individual variability -
all modeled as spatially distributed and temporally registered features via
beta-band activity in the brain and a feedback. Furthermore, we purposely built
our framework as a structured environment for training and evaluating deep
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, opening new possibilities for
optimizing aDBS control strategies and inviting the machine learning community
to contribute to the emerging field of intelligent neurostimulation interfaces.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML)
have led to the emergence of quantum machine learning (QML), which integrates
the strengths of both fields. Among QML approaches, variational quantum
circuits (VQCs), also known as quantum neural networks (QNNs), have shown
promise both empirically and theoretically. However, their broader adoption is
hindered by reliance on quantum hardware during inference. Hardware
imperfections and limited access to quantum devices pose practical challenges.
To address this, the Quantum-Train (QT) framework leverages the exponential
scaling of quantum amplitudes to generate classical neural network parameters,
enabling inference without quantum hardware and achieving significant parameter
compression. Yet, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for such
quantum-enhanced neural programmers remains non-trivial and often requires
expertise in quantum information science. In this paper, we propose an
automated solution using differentiable optimization. Our method jointly
optimizes both conventional circuit parameters and architectural parameters in
an end-to-end manner via automatic differentiation. We evaluate the proposed
framework on classification, time-series prediction, and reinforcement learning
tasks. Simulation results show that our method matches or outperforms manually
designed QNN architectures. This work offers a scalable and automated pathway
for designing QNNs that can generate classical neural network parameters across
diverse applications.

generation across wind farms by routing AI inferencing workload around power

Abstract: Mesoscale eddies dominate the spatiotemporal multiscale variability of the
ocean, and their impact on the energy cascade of the global ocean cannot be
ignored. Eddy-resolving ocean forecasting is providing more reliable protection
for fisheries and navigational safety, but also presents significant scientific
challenges and high computational costs for traditional numerical models.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather and ocean forecasting systems are
becoming powerful tools that balance forecast performance with computational
efficiency. However, the complex multiscale features in the ocean dynamical
system make AI models still face many challenges in mesoscale eddy forecasting
(especially regional modelling). Here, we develop LanTu, a regional
eddy-resolving ocean forecasting system based on dynamics-enhanced deep
learning. We incorporate cross-scale interactions into LanTu and construct
multiscale physical constraint for optimising LanTu guided by knowledge of eddy
dynamics in order to improve the forecasting skill of LanTu for mesoscale
evolution. The results show that LanTu outperforms the existing advanced
operational numerical ocean forecasting system (NOFS) and AI-based ocean
forecasting system (AI-OFS) in temperature, salinity, sea level anomaly and
current prediction, with a lead time of more than 10 days. Our study highlights
that dynamics-enhanced deep learning (LanTu) can be a powerful paradigm for

Abstract: Community detection, a vital technology for real-world applications, uncovers
cohesive node groups (communities) by leveraging both topological and attribute
similarities in social networks. However, existing Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) trained to maximize modularity often converge to suboptimal solutions.
Additionally, directly using human-labeled communities for training can
undermine topological cohesiveness by grouping disconnected nodes based solely
on node attributes. We address these issues by proposing a novel Topological
and Attributive Similarity-based Community detection (TAS-Com) method. TAS-Com
introduces a novel loss function that exploits the highly effective and
scalable Leiden algorithm to detect community structures with global optimal
modularity. Leiden is further utilized to refine human-labeled communities to
ensure connectivity within each community, enabling TAS-Com to detect community
structures with desirable trade-offs between modularity and compliance with
human labels. Experimental results on multiple benchmark networks confirm that
TAS-Com can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art algorithms.

Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is a well-known example of monotonic
reasoning, of intense practical interest due to fast solvers, complemented by
rigorous fine-grained complexity results. However, for non-monotonic reasoning,
e.g., abductive reasoning, comparably little is known outside classic
complexity theory. In this paper we take a first step of bridging the gap
between monotonic and non-monotonic reasoning by analyzing the complexity of
intractable abduction problems under the seemingly overlooked but natural
parameter n: the number of variables in the knowledge base. We obtain several
positive results for $\Sigma^P_2$- as well as NP- and coNP-complete fragments,
which implies the first example of beating exhaustive search for a
$\Sigma^P_2$-complete problem (to the best of our knowledge). We complement
this with lower bounds and for many fragments rule out improvements under the
(strong) exponential-time hypothesis.

Abstract: The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has drawn increasing attention for its
energy-efficient, event-driven processing and biological plausibility. To train
SNNs via backpropagation, surrogate gradients are used to approximate the
non-differentiable spike function, but they only maintain nonzero derivatives
within a narrow range of membrane potentials near the firing threshold,
referred to as the surrogate gradient support width gamma. We identify a major
challenge, termed the dilemma of gamma: a relatively large gamma leads to
overactivation, characterized by excessive neuron firing, which in turn
increases energy consumption, whereas a small gamma causes vanishing gradients
and weakens temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose a temporal
Inhibitory Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ILIF) neuron model, inspired by biological
inhibitory mechanisms. This model incorporates interconnected inhibitory units
for membrane potential and current, effectively mitigating overactivation while
preserving gradient propagation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates ILIF
effectiveness in overcoming the gamma dilemma, and extensive experiments on
multiple datasets show that ILIF improves energy efficiency by reducing firing
rates, stabilizes training, and enhances accuracy. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究填补了MAPF问题复杂性分析的空白，为实际应用提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem asks to find a set of paths on a
graph such that when synchronously following these paths the agents never
encounter a conflict. In the most widespread MAPF formulation, the so-called
Classical MAPF, the agents sizes are neglected and two types of conflicts are
considered: occupying the same vertex or using the same edge at the same time
step. Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking
into account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can
be safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of
conflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the
body of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying
still at some distinct vertex of the graph). Until now it was not clear how
harder the problem gets when such conflicts are to be considered while
planning. Specifically, it was known that Classical MAPF problem on an
undirected graph can be solved in polynomial time, however no complete
polynomial-time algorithm was presented to solve MAPF with large agents. In
this paper we, for the first time, establish that the latter problem is NP-hard
and, thus, if P!=NP no polynomial algorithm for it can, unfortunately, be
presented. Our proof is based on the prevalent in the field technique of
reducing the seminal 3SAT problem (which is known to be an NP-complete problem)
to the problem at hand. In particular, for an arbitrary 3SAT formula we
procedurally construct a dedicated graph with specific start and goal vertices
and show that the given 3SAT formula is satisfiable iff the corresponding path
finding instance has a solution.

Motivation: 传统RIC在实时监控和用户数据访问方面存在限制，影响了如波束成形和频谱分类等应用。本文旨在通过dApps和LibIQ库解决这些问题。

Method: 利用LibIQ库处理I/Q样本，通过CNN分类信号。数据集基于5G部署和OTA测试床生成，模型在多种场景下评估。

Conclusion: LibIQ和数据集将公开，为实时频谱分析提供了高效工具。

Abstract: The O-RAN architecture is transforming cellular networks by adopting RAN
softwarization and disaggregation concepts to enable data-driven monitoring and
control of the network. Such management is enabled by RICs, which facilitate
near-real-time and non-real-time network control through xApps and rApps.
However, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange
between the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to
access user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use
cases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage
the dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a
novel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and
signal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as
time-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and
spectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to
detect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN
inside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an
extensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct
signal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the
Colosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by
deploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies,
time windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model
classifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of
approximately 97.8\% in identifying signal types across all scenarios. We
pledge to release both LibIQ and the dataset created as a publicly available
framework upon acceptance.

Abstract: The management of chronic Heart Failure (HF) presents significant challenges
in modern healthcare, requiring continuous monitoring, early detection of
exacerbations, and personalized treatment strategies. In this paper, we present
a predictive model founded on Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify
patients at HF risk. This model is an ensemble learning approach, a modified
stacking technique, that uses two specialized models leveraging clinical and
echocardiographic features and then a meta-model to combine the predictions of
these two models. We initially assess the model on a real dataset and the
obtained results suggest that it performs well in the stratification of
patients at HR risk. Specifically, we obtained high sensitivity (95\%),
ensuring that nearly all high-risk patients are identified. As for accuracy, we
obtained 84\%, which can be considered moderate in some ML contexts. However,
it is acceptable given our priority of identifying patients at risk of HF
because they will be asked to participate in the telemonitoring program of the
PrediHealth research project on which some of the authors of this paper are
working. The initial findings also suggest that ML-based risk stratification
models can serve as valuable decision-support tools not only in the PrediHealth
project but also for healthcare professionals, aiding in early intervention and
personalized patient management. To have a better understanding of the value
and of potentiality of our predictive model, we also contrasted its results
with those obtained by using three baseline models. The preliminary results
indicate that our predictive model outperforms these baselines that flatly
consider features, \ie not grouping them in clinical and echocardiographic
features.

Conclusion: 空间分区统一了任务分配和碰撞避免问题，适用于稀疏地理区域中的多任务场景。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel framework is presented that achieves a combined
solution based on Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) and collision avoidance
with respect to homogeneous measurement tasks taking place in industrial
environments. The spatial clustering we propose offers to simultaneously solve
the task allocation problem and deal with collision risks by cutting the
workspace into distinguishable operational zones for each robot. To divide task
sites and to schedule robot routes within corresponding clusters, we use
K-means clustering and the 2-Opt algorithm. The presented framework shows
satisfactory performance, where up to 93\% time reduction (1.24s against
17.62s) with a solution quality improvement of up to 7\% compared to the best
performing method is demonstrated. Our method also completely eliminates
collision points that persist in comparative methods in a most significant
sense. Theoretical analysis agrees with the claim that spatial partitioning
unifies the apparently disjoint tasks allocation and collision avoidance
problems under conditions of many identical tasks to be distributed over sparse
geographical areas. Ultimately, the findings in this work are of substantial
importance for real world applications where both computational efficiency and
operation free from collisions is of paramount importance.

Abstract: This work presents a methodology for reconstructing the spatial distribution
of the neutron flux in a nuclear reactor, leveraging real-time measurements
obtained from ex-core detectors. The Kirchhoff-Helmholtz (K-H) equation
inherently defines the problem of estimating a scalar field within a domain
based on boundary data, making it a natural mathematical framework for this
task. The main challenge lies in deriving the Green's function specific to the
domain and the neutron diffusion process. While analytical solutions for
Green's functions exist for simplified geometries, their derivation of complex,
heterogeneous domains-such as a nuclear reactor-requires a numerical approach.
The objective of this work is to demonstrate the well-posedness of the
data-driven Green's function approximation by formulating and solving the K-H
equation as an inverse problem. After establishing the symmetry properties that
the Green's function must satisfy, the K-H equation is derived from the
one-speed neutron diffusion model. This is followed by a comprehensive
description of the procedure for interpreting sensor readings and implementing
the neutron flux reconstruction algorithm. Finally, the existence and
uniqueness of the Green's function inferred from the sampled data are
demonstrated, ensuring the reliability of the proposed method and its
predictions.

Result: 高环境稳定性显著偏向IWL，而高线索可靠性增强ICL效果；学习动态显示任务依赖的阶段性变化。

Conclusion: 可预测性是决定Transformer学习模式的关键因素，支持相对成本假说。

Abstract: Transformer models learn in two distinct modes: in-weights learning (IWL),
encoding knowledge into model weights, and in-context learning (ICL), adapting
flexibly to context without weight modification. To better understand the
interplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary
biology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,
adapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and
phenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to
environmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability
dictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic
encoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We
experimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and
systematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in
Transformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high
environmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp
transition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL
efficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics
reveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift
occurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we
demonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL
acquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding
to ICL dominance. These findings support a relative-cost hypothesis for
explaining these learning mode transitions, establishing predictability as a
critical factor governing adaptive strategies in Transformers, and offering
novel insights for understanding ICL and guiding training methodologies.

Conclusion: ComplexFormer提供了一种更具表达力和适应性的注意力机制，参数效率高。

Abstract: Transformer models rely on self-attention to capture token dependencies but
face challenges in effectively integrating positional information while
allowing multi-head attention (MHA) flexibility. Prior methods often model
semantic and positional differences disparately or apply uniform positional
adjustments across heads, potentially limiting representational capacity. This
paper introduces ComplexFormer, featuring Complex Multi-Head Attention-CMHA.
CMHA empowers each head to independently model semantic and positional
differences unified within the complex plane, representing interactions as
rotations and scaling. ComplexFormer incorporates two key improvements: (1) a
per-head Euler transformation, converting real-valued query/key projections
into polar-form complex vectors for head-specific complex subspace operation;
and (2) a per-head adaptive differential rotation mechanism,
exp[i(Adapt(ASmn,i) + Delta(Pmn),i)], allowing each head to learn distinct
strategies for integrating semantic angle differences (ASmn,i) with relative
positional encodings (Delta(Pmn),i). Extensive experiments on language
modeling, text generation, code generation, and mathematical reasoning show
ComplexFormer achieves superior performance, significantly lower generation
perplexity , and improved long-context coherence compared to strong baselines
like RoPE-Transformers. ComplexFormer demonstrates strong parameter efficiency,
offering a more expressive, adaptable attention mechanism.

Conclusion: 表示叠加是神经缩放定律的基础，可能启发更高效的训练策略和架构设计。

Abstract: The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the
observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this
neural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model
size -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs
represent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,
representations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur
with varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss
scaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only
the most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of
loss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature
frequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong
superposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,
the loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide
range of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is
explained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower
dimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales
inversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced
LLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match
the predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also
agree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an
important mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws. We anticipate
that these insights will inspire new training strategies and model
architectures to achieve better performance with less computation and fewer
parameters.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks thanks to advances in
reasoning abilities. However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between
reasoning effectiveness and computational efficiency, often encouraging
unnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we
propose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement
fine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning
with fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as
a hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense
process reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in
parameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We
propose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and
the Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly
reduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately
rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T
optimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each
episode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning
benchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different
tasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了噪声和对抗性策展对生成模型的影响，并提出了应对策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have made it increasingly difficult to
distinguish real data from model-generated synthetic data. Using synthetic data
for successive training of future model generations creates "self-consuming
loops", which may lead to model collapse or training instability. Furthermore,
synthetic data is often subject to human feedback and curated by users based on
their preferences. Ferbach et al. (2024) recently showed that when data is
curated according to user preferences, the self-consuming retraining loop
drives the model to converge toward a distribution that optimizes those
preferences. However, in practice, data curation is often noisy or
adversarially manipulated. For example, competing platforms may recruit
malicious users to adversarially curate data and disrupt rival models. In this
paper, we study how generative models evolve under self-consuming retraining
loops with noisy and adversarially curated data. We theoretically analyze the
impact of such noisy data curation on generative models and identify conditions
for the robustness of the retraining process. Building on this analysis, we
design attack algorithms for competitive adversarial scenarios, where a
platform with a limited budget employs malicious users to misalign a rival's
model from actual user preferences. Experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used, understanding them
systematically is key to improving their safety and realizing their full
potential. Although many models are aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), they are still vulnerable to
jailbreaking attacks. Some of the existing adversarial attack methods search
for discrete tokens that may jailbreak a target model while others try to
optimize the continuous space represented by the tokens of the model's
vocabulary. While techniques based on the discrete space may prove to be
inefficient, optimization of continuous token embeddings requires projections
to produce discrete tokens, which might render them ineffective. To fully
utilize the constraints and the structures of the space, we develop an
intrinsic optimization technique using exponentiated gradient descent with the
Bregman projection method to ensure that the optimized one-hot encoding always
stays within the probability simplex. We prove the convergence of the technique
and implement an efficient algorithm that is effective in jailbreaking several
widely used LLMs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique using
five open-source LLMs on four openly available datasets. The results show that
the technique achieves a higher success rate with great efficiency compared to
three other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques. The source code for our

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate or automate
human behavior in complex sequential decision-making tasks. A natural question
is then whether LLMs exhibit similar decision-making behavior to humans, and
can achieve comparable (or superior) performance. In this work, we focus on the
exploration-exploitation (E&E) tradeoff, a fundamental aspect of dynamic
decision-making under uncertainty. We employ canonical multi-armed bandit (MAB)
tasks introduced in the cognitive science and psychiatry literature to conduct
a comparative study of the E&E strategies of LLMs, humans, and MAB algorithms.
We use interpretable choice models to capture the E&E strategies of the agents
and investigate how explicit reasoning, through both prompting strategies and
reasoning-enhanced models, shapes LLM decision-making. We find that reasoning
shifts LLMs toward more human-like behavior, characterized by a mix of random
and directed exploration. In simple stationary tasks, reasoning-enabled LLMs
exhibit similar levels of random and directed exploration compared to humans.
However, in more complex, non-stationary environments, LLMs struggle to match
human adaptability, particularly in effective directed exploration, despite
achieving similar regret in certain scenarios. Our findings highlight both the
promise and limits of LLMs as simulators of human behavior and tools for
automated decision-making and point to potential areas of improvements.

Abstract: This paper introduces an interactive continual learning paradigm where AI
models dynamically learn new skills from real-time human feedback while
retaining prior knowledge. This paradigm distinctively addresses two major
limitations of traditional continual learning: (1) dynamic model updates using
streaming, real-time human-annotated data, rather than static datasets with
fixed labels, and (2) the assumption of clean labels, by explicitly handling
the noisy feedback common in real-world interactions. To tackle these problems,
we propose RiCL, a Reinforced interactive Continual Learning framework
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn new skills effectively from
dynamic feedback. RiCL incorporates three key components: a temporal
consistency-aware purifier to automatically discern clean from noisy samples in
data streams; an interaction-aware direct preference optimization strategy to
align model behavior with human intent by reconciling AI-generated and
human-provided feedback; and a noise-resistant contrastive learning module that
captures robust representations by exploiting inherent data relationships, thus
avoiding reliance on potentially unreliable labels. Extensive experiments on
two benchmark datasets (FewRel and TACRED), contaminated with realistic noise
patterns, demonstrate that our RiCL approach substantially outperforms existing
combinations of state-of-the-art online continual learning and noisy-label
learning methods.

Abstract: A central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is its dependence on
extensive real-world interaction data to learn task-specific policies. While
recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can mitigate this
limitation by generating synthetic experience (noted as imaginary rollouts) for
mastering novel tasks, progress in this emerging field is hindered due to the
lack of a standard benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce ImagineBench,
the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms that
leverage both real rollouts and LLM-imaginary rollouts. The key features of
ImagineBench include: (1) datasets comprising environment-collected and
LLM-imaginary rollouts; (2) diverse domains of environments covering
locomotion, robotic manipulation, and navigation tasks; and (3) natural
language task instructions with varying complexity levels to facilitate
language-conditioned policy learning. Through systematic evaluation of
state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, we observe that simply applying
existing offline RL algorithms leads to suboptimal performance on unseen tasks,
achieving 35.44% success rate in hard tasks in contrast to 64.37% of method
training on real rollouts for hard tasks. This result highlights the need for
algorithm advancements to better leverage LLM-imaginary rollouts. Additionally,
we identify key opportunities for future research: including better utilization
of imaginary rollouts, fast online adaptation and continual learning, and
extension to multi-modal tasks. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Circuit discovery has gradually become one of the prominent methods for
mechanistic interpretability, and research on circuit completeness has also
garnered increasing attention. Methods of circuit discovery that do not
guarantee completeness not only result in circuits that are not fixed across
different runs but also cause key mechanisms to be omitted. The nature of
incompleteness arises from the presence of OR gates within the circuit, which
are often only partially detected in standard circuit discovery methods. To
this end, we systematically introduce three types of logic gates: AND, OR, and
ADDER gates, and decompose the circuit into combinations of these logical
gates. Through the concept of these gates, we derive the minimum requirements
necessary to achieve faithfulness and completeness. Furthermore, we propose a
framework that combines noising-based and denoising-based interventions, which
can be easily integrated into existing circuit discovery methods without
significantly increasing computational complexity. This framework is capable of
fully identifying the logic gates and distinguishing them within the circuit.
In addition to the extensive experimental validation of the framework's ability
to restore the faithfulness, completeness, and sparsity of circuits, using this
framework, we uncover fundamental properties of the three logic gates, such as
their proportions and contributions to the output, and explore how they behave
among the functionalities of language models.

Conclusion: SpecOffload通过推测解码和卸载的协同设计，显著提升了LLM在资源受限设备上的推理效率。

Abstract: Efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices presents significant
challenges in compute and memory utilization. Due to limited GPU memory,
existing systems offload model weights to CPU memory, incurring substantial I/O
overhead between the CPU and GPU. This leads to two major inefficiencies: (1)
GPU cores are underutilized, often remaining idle while waiting for data to be
loaded; and (2) GPU memory has low impact on performance, as reducing its
capacity has minimal effect on overall throughput.In this paper, we propose
SpecOffload, a high-throughput inference engine that embeds speculative
decoding into offloading. Our key idea is to unlock latent GPU resources for
storing and executing a draft model used for speculative decoding, thus
accelerating inference at near-zero additional cost. To support this, we
carefully orchestrate the interleaved execution of target and draft models in
speculative decoding within the offloading pipeline, and propose a planner to
manage tensor placement and select optimal parameters. Compared to the best
baseline, SpecOffload improves GPU core utilization by 4.49x and boosts
inference throughput by 2.54x. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统的语言模型扩展方法（参数扩展或推理时扩展）通常伴随较高的空间或时间成本，ParScale旨在提供一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过应用P种多样且可学习的输入变换，并行执行模型前向传播，并动态聚合输出，实现并行计算扩展。

Result: 实验表明，ParScale在相同性能提升下，内存和延迟开销分别减少22倍和6倍，且可通过少量令牌的后训练实现模型扩展。

Conclusion: ParScale为低资源场景下部署更强大模型提供了新思路，并重新定义了计算在机器学习中的作用。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that scaling language models should commit a
significant space or time cost, by increasing the parameters (parameter
scaling) or output tokens (inference-time scaling). We introduce the third and
more inference-efficient scaling paradigm: increasing the model's parallel
computation during both training and inference time. We apply $P$ diverse and
learnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in
parallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs. This method, namely
parallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing
parameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure,
data, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it
through large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with $P$ parallel
streams is similar to scaling the parameters by $O(\log P)$ while showing
superior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22$\times$
less memory increase and 6$\times$ less latency increase compared to parameter
scaling that achieves the same performance improvement. It can also recycle an
off-the-shelf pre-trained model into a parallelly scaled one by post-training
on a small amount of tokens, further reducing the training budget. The new
scaling law we discovered potentially facilitates the deployment of more
powerful models in low-resource scenarios, and provides an alternative
perspective for the role of computation in machine learning.

Abstract: This paper addresses fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for function
calling tasks when real user interaction data is unavailable. In digital
content creation tools, where users express their needs through natural
language queries that must be mapped to API calls, the lack of real-world
task-specific data and privacy constraints for training on it necessitate
synthetic data generation. Existing approaches to synthetic data generation
fall short in diversity and complexity, failing to replicate real-world data
distributions and leading to suboptimal performance after LLM fine-tuning. We
present a novel router-based architecture that leverages domain resources like
content metadata and structured knowledge graphs, along with text-to-text and
vision-to-text language models to generate high-quality synthetic training
data. Our architecture's flexible routing mechanism enables synthetic data
generation that matches observed real-world distributions, addressing a
fundamental limitation of traditional approaches. Evaluation on a comprehensive
set of real user queries demonstrates significant improvements in both function
classification accuracy and API parameter selection. Models fine-tuned with our
synthetic data consistently outperform traditional approaches, establishing new
benchmarks for function calling tasks.

Abstract: Speculative decoding significantly accelerates language model inference by
enabling a lightweight draft model to propose multiple tokens that a larger
target model verifies simultaneously. However, applying this technique to
vision-language models (VLMs) presents two fundamental challenges: small
language models that could serve as efficient drafters lack the architectural
components to process visual inputs, and their token predictions fail to match
those of VLM target models that consider visual context. We introduce
Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of
Vision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models
into effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first
connects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight
trainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning
using responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions.
Comprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families
demonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers
end-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV
provides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both

Abstract: Spiking Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an energy-efficient
alternative to conventional LLMs through their event-driven computation. To
effectively obtain spiking LLMs, researchers develop different ANN-to-SNN
conversion methods by leveraging pre-trained ANN parameters while inheriting
the energy efficiency of SNN. However, existing conversion methods struggle
with extreme activation outliers and incompatible nonlinear operations of
ANN-based LLMs. To address this, we propose a loss-less ANN-SNN conversion for
fully spike-driven LLMs, termed LAS. Specifically, LAS introduces two novel
neurons to convert the activation outlier and nonlinear operation of ANN-based
LLMs. Moreover, LAS tailors the spike-equivalent Transformer components for
spiking LLMs, which can ensure full spiking conversion without any loss of
performance. Experimental results on six language models and two
vision-language models demonstrate that LAS achieves loss-less conversion.
Notably, on OPT-66B, LAS even improves the accuracy of 2\% on the WSC task. In
addition, the parameter and ablation studies further verify the effectiveness
of LAS. The source code is available at https://github.com/lc783/LAS

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation is considered a hallmark of human
and animal intelligence. To achieve OOD through composition, a system must
discover the environment-invariant properties of experienced input-output
mappings and transfer them to novel inputs. This can be realised if an
intelligent system can identify appropriate, task-invariant, and composable
input features, as well as the composition methods, thus allowing it to act
based not on the interpolation between learnt data points but on the
task-invariant composition of those features. We propose that in order to
confirm that an algorithm does indeed learn compositional structures from data,
it is not enough to just test on an OOD setup, but one also needs to confirm
that the features identified are indeed compositional. We showcase this by
exploring two tasks with clearly defined OOD metrics that are not OOD solvable
by three commonly used neural networks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Transformer. In addition, we develop
two novel network architectures imbued with biases that allow them to be
successful in OOD scenarios. We show that even with correct biases and almost
perfect OOD performance, an algorithm can still fail to learn the correct
features for compositional generalisation.

Abstract: During the training of Large Language Models (LLMs), tensor data is
periodically "checkpointed" to persistent storage to allow recovery of work
done in the event of failure. The volume of data that must be copied during
each checkpoint, even when using reduced-precision representations such as
bfloat16, often reaches hundreds of gigabytes. Furthermore, the data must be
moved across a network and written to a storage system before the next epoch
occurs. With a view to ultimately building an optimized checkpointing solution,
this paper presents experimental analysis of checkpoint data used to derive a
design that maximizes the use of lossless compression to reduce the volume of
data. We examine how tensor data and its compressibility evolve during model
training and evaluate the efficacy of existing common off-the-shelf general
purpose compression engines combined with known data optimization techniques
such as byte-grouping and incremental delta compression.
  Leveraging our analysis we have built an effective compression solution,
known as Language Model Compressor (LMC), which is based on byte-grouping and
Huffman encoding. LMC offers more compression performance than the best
alternative (BZ2) but with an order-of-magnitude reduction in the time needed
to perform the compression. We show that a 16-core parallel implementation of
LMC can attain compression and decompression throughput of 2.78 GiB/s and 3.76
GiB/s respectively. This increase in performance ultimately reduces the CPU
resources needed and provides more time to copy the data to the storage system
before the next epoch thus allowing for higher-frequency checkpoints.

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning has increased
exponentially. Models are far more complex than ever before, growing to
gargantuan sizes and housing millions of weights. Unfortunately, the fact that
large models have become the state of the art means that it often costs
millions of dollars to train and operate them. These expenses not only hurt
companies but also bar non-wealthy individuals from contributing to new
developments and force consumers to pay greater prices for AI. Current methods
used to prune models, such as iterative magnitude pruning, have shown great
accuracy but require an iterative training sequence that is incredibly
computationally and environmentally taxing. To solve this problem, BINGO is
introduced. BINGO, during the training pass, studies specific subsets of a
neural network one at a time to gauge how significant of a role each weight
plays in contributing to a network's accuracy. By the time training is done,
BINGO generates a significance score for each weight, allowing for
insignificant weights to be pruned in one shot. BINGO provides an
accuracy-preserving pruning technique that is less computationally intensive
than current methods, allowing for a world where AI growth does not have to
mean model growth, as well.

Abstract: Conventional forecasting methods rely on unimodal time series data, limiting
their ability to exploit rich textual information. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated
powerful capability in textual reasoning and temporal modeling, respectively.
Integrating the strengths of both to construct a multimodal model that
concurrently leverages both temporal and textual information for future
inference has emerged as a critical research challenge. To address the scarcity
of event-series paired data, we propose a decoupled framework: an LLM is
employed to transform textual events into revision instructions, which are then
used to steer the output of TSFM. To implement this framework, we introduce
ChronoSteer, a multimodal TSFM that can be steered through textual revision
instructions, effectively bridging LLM and TSFM. Moreover, to mitigate the
shortage of cross-modal instruction-series paired data, we devise a two-stage
training strategy based on synthetic data. In addition, we also construct a
high-quality multimodal time series forecasting benchmark to address the
information leakage concerns during evaluation. After integrating with an LLM,
ChronoSteer, which is trained exclusively on synthetic data, achieves a 25.7%
improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the unimodal backbone and a
22.5% gain over the previous state-of-the-art multimodal method.

Abstract: Rapid expansion of model size has emerged as a key challenge in time series
forecasting. From early Transformer with tens of megabytes to recent
architectures like TimesNet with thousands of megabytes, performance gains have
often come at the cost of exponentially increasing parameter counts. But is
this scaling truly necessary? To question the applicability of the scaling law
in time series forecasting, we propose Alinear, an ultra-lightweight
forecasting model that achieves competitive performance using only k-level
parameters. We introduce a horizon-aware adaptive decomposition mechanism that
dynamically rebalances component emphasis across different forecast lengths,
alongside a progressive frequency attenuation strategy that achieves stable
prediction in various forecasting horizons without incurring the computational
overhead of attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
datasets demonstrate that Alinear consistently outperforms large-scale models
while using less than 1% of their parameters, maintaining strong accuracy
across both short and ultra-long forecasting horizons. Moreover, to more fairly
evaluate model efficiency, we propose a new parameter-aware evaluation metric
that highlights the superiority of ALinear under constrained model budgets. Our
analysis reveals that the relative importance of trend and seasonal components
varies depending on data characteristics rather than following a fixed pattern,
validating the necessity of our adaptive design. This work challenges the
prevailing belief that larger models are inherently better and suggests a
paradigm shift toward more efficient time series modeling.

Abstract: Human learning relies on specialization -- distinct cognitive mechanisms
working together to enable rapid learning. In contrast, most modern neural
networks rely on a single mechanism: gradient descent over an objective
function. This raises the question: might human learners' relatively rapid
learning from just tens of examples instead of tens of thousands in data-driven
deep learning arise from our ability to use multiple specialized mechanisms of
learning in combination? We investigate this question through an ablation
analysis of inductive human learning simulations in online tutoring
environments. Comparing reinforcement learning to a more data-efficient
3-mechanism symbolic rule induction approach, we find that decomposing learning
into multiple distinct mechanisms significantly improves data efficiency,

decomposition has a greater impact on efficiency than the distinction between
symbolic and subsymbolic learning alone. Efforts to align data-driven machine

efficiency. Our findings suggest that integrating multiple specialized learning
mechanisms may be key to bridging this gap.

Motivation: 现有价值函数分解方法（如VDN、QMIX）表示能力有限，而QPLEX虽无限制但过于复杂，需要一种简单且高效的方法。

Method: 提出QFIX，通过简单的“修正”层扩展表示能力，并在多个多智能体框架中实现三种变体。

Result: 在SMACv2和Overcooked环境中，QFIX提升了性能，比QPLEX更稳定且简单。

Conclusion: QFIX是一种简单高效的价值函数分解方法，扩展了表示能力并提升了性能。

Abstract: Value function decomposition methods for cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning compose joint values from individual per-agent
utilities, and train them using a joint objective. To ensure that the action
selection process between individual utilities and joint values remains
consistent, it is imperative for the composition to satisfy the
individual-global max (IGM) property. Although satisfying IGM itself is
straightforward, most existing methods (e.g., VDN, QMIX) have limited
representation capabilities and are unable to represent the full class of IGM
values, and the one exception that has no such limitation (QPLEX) is
unnecessarily complex. In this work, we present a simple formulation of the
full class of IGM values that naturally leads to the derivation of QFIX, a
novel family of value function decomposition models that expand the
representation capabilities of prior models by means of a thin "fixing" layer.
We derive multiple variants of QFIX, and implement three variants in two
well-known multi-agent frameworks. We perform an empirical evaluation on
multiple SMACv2 and Overcooked environments, which confirms that QFIX (i)
succeeds in enhancing the performance of prior methods, (ii) learns more stably
and performs better than its main competitor QPLEX, and (iii) achieves this
while employing the simplest and smallest mixing models.

Abstract: Recently, post hoc explanation methods have emerged to enhance model
transparency by attributing model outputs to input features. However, these
methods face challenges due to their specificity to certain neural network
architectures and data modalities. Existing explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) frameworks have attempted to address these challenges but suffer from
several limitations. These include limited flexibility to diverse model
architectures and data modalities due to hard-coded implementations, a
restricted number of supported XAI methods because of the requirements for
layer-specific operations of attribution methods, and sub-optimal
recommendations of explanations due to the lack of evaluation and optimization
phases. Consequently, these limitations impede the adoption of XAI technology
in real-world applications, making it difficult for practitioners to select the
optimal explanation method for their domain. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{PnPXAI}, a universal XAI framework that supports diverse data
modalities and neural network models in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) manner. PnPXAI
automatically detects model architectures, recommends applicable explanation
methods, and optimizes hyperparameters for optimal explanations. We validate
the framework's effectiveness through user surveys and showcase its versatility
across various domains, including medicine and finance.

LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting
accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series
dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary

outperforms the uninformed baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and
generalization. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge transfer
strategies to bridge the gap between LLMs and domain-specific forecasting

Abstract: Real-world autonomous decision-making systems, from robots to recommendation
engines, must operate in environments that change over time. While deep
reinforcement learning (RL) has shown an impressive ability to learn optimal
policies in stationary environments, most methods are data intensive and assume
a world that does not change between training and test time. As a result,
conventional RL methods struggle to adapt when conditions change. This poses a
fundamental challenge: how can RL agents efficiently adapt their behavior when
encountering novel environmental changes during deployment without
catastrophically forgetting useful prior knowledge? This dissertation
demonstrates that efficient online adaptation requires two key capabilities:
(1) prioritized exploration and sampling strategies that help identify and
learn from relevant experiences, and (2) selective preservation of prior
knowledge through structured representations that can be updated without
disruption to reusable components.

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) is a promising compute paradigm to improve
speed and power efficiency of neural network inference beyond the limits of
conventional von Neumann-based architectures. However, AIMC introduces
fundamental challenges such as noisy computations and strict constraints on
input and output quantization. Because of these constraints and imprecisions,
off-the-shelf LLMs are not able to achieve 4-bit-level performance when
deployed on AIMC-based hardware. While researchers previously investigated
recovering this accuracy gap on small, mostly vision-based models, a generic
method applicable to LLMs pre-trained on trillions of tokens does not yet
exist. In this work, we introduce a general and scalable method to robustly
adapt LLMs for execution on noisy, low-precision analog hardware. Our approach
enables state-of-the-art models $\unicode{x2013}$ including
Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct $\unicode{x2013}$ to retain
performance comparable to 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation baselines, despite the
presence of analog noise and quantization constraints. Additionally, we show
that as a byproduct of our training methodology, analog foundation models can
be quantized for inference on low-precision digital hardware. Finally, we show
that our models also benefit from test-time compute scaling, showing better
scaling behavior than models trained with 4-bit weight and 8-bit static input
quantization. Our work bridges the gap between high-capacity LLMs and efficient
analog hardware, offering a path toward energy-efficient foundation models.

Abstract: The introduction of multimodal models is a huge step forward in Artificial
Intelligence. A single model is trained to understand multiple modalities:
text, image, video, and audio. Open-source multimodal models have made these
breakthroughs more accessible. However, considering the vast landscape of
adversarial attacks across these modalities, these models also inherit
vulnerabilities of all the modalities, and ultimately, the adversarial threat
amplifies. While broad research is available on possible attacks within or
across these modalities, a practitioner-focused view that outlines attack types
remains absent in the multimodal world. As more Machine Learning Practitioners
adopt, fine-tune, and deploy open-source models in real-world applications,
it's crucial that they can view the threat landscape and take the preventive
actions necessary. This paper addresses the gap by surveying adversarial
attacks targeting all four modalities: text, image, video, and audio. This
survey provides a view of the adversarial attack landscape and presents how
multimodal adversarial threats have evolved. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first comprehensive summarization of the threat landscape in the
multimodal world.

Abstract: Understanding the factors contributing to traffic crashes and developing
strategies to mitigate their severity is essential. Traditional statistical
methods and machine learning models often struggle to capture the complex
interactions between various factors and the unique characteristics of each
crash. This research leverages large language model (LLM) to analyze freeway
crash data and provide crash causation analysis accordingly. By compiling 226
traffic safety studies related to freeway crashes, a training dataset
encompassing environmental, driver, traffic, and geometric design factors was
created. The Llama3 8B model was fine-tuned using QLoRA to enhance its
understanding of freeway crashes and their contributing factors, as covered in
these studies. The fine-tuned Llama3 8B model was then used to identify crash
causation without pre-labeled data through zero-shot classification, providing
comprehensive explanations to ensure that the identified causes were reasonable
and aligned with existing research. Results demonstrate that LLMs effectively
identify primary crash causes such as alcohol-impaired driving, speeding,
aggressive driving, and driver inattention. Incorporating event data, such as
road maintenance, offers more profound insights. The model's practical
applicability and potential to improve traffic safety measures were validated
by a high level of agreement among researchers in the field of traffic safety,
as reflected in questionnaire results with 88.89%. This research highlights the
complex nature of traffic crashes and how LLMs can be used for comprehensive
analysis of crash causation and other contributing factors. Moreover, it

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models often prioritize predictive accuracy,

Further efforts were made to explain the model's predictions using Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME), Partial Dependence Plots
(PDP), and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI). The IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection
dataset, which includes more than 590,000 real transaction records, was used to
evaluate the proposed model. The model achieved a high performance with an
accuracy of 99% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.99, outperforming several recent

Abstract: Specialized Multi-Task Optimizers (SMTOs) balance task learning in Multi-Task
Learning by addressing issues like conflicting gradients and differing gradient

suggest that equally weighted tasks can achieve competitive results compared to
SMTOs, arguing that previous SMTO results were influenced by poor

clarify this behavior. Our findings indicate that SMTOs perform well compared

compared to SMTOs. Furthermore, we demonstrate why uniform loss perform

Abstract: There are now a multitude of AI-scribing solutions for healthcare promising
the utilization of large language models for ambient documentation. However,
these AI scribes still rely on one-shot, or few-shot prompts for generating
notes after the consultation has ended, employing little to no reasoning. This
risks long notes with an increase in hallucinations, misrepresentation of the
intent of the clinician, and reliance on the proofreading of the clinician to
catch errors. A dangerous combination for patient safety if vigilance is
compromised by workload and fatigue. In this paper, we introduce a method for
extracting salient clinical information in real-time alongside the healthcare
consultation, denoted Facts, and use that information recursively to generate
the final note. The FactsR method results in more accurate and concise notes by
placing the clinician-in-the-loop of note generation, while opening up new use

Abstract: Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as
robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills
from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the
sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion
policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures.
While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising
solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to
effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This
challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood
estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated
optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized
policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much
lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies
(MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework
that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy.
By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned
on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and
gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments
demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when
training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency
and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot
control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results
show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the
Diffusion Policy.

Abstract: We introduce the first one-stage Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer framework, which
unifies prediction and deferral by learning a shared score-based model that
selects the $k$ most cost-effective entities-labels or experts-per input. While
existing one-stage L2D methods are limited to deferring to a single expert, our
approach jointly optimizes prediction and deferral across multiple entities
through a single end-to-end objective. We define a cost-sensitive loss and
derive a novel convex surrogate that is independent of the cardinality
parameter $k$, enabling generalization across Top-$k$ regimes without
retraining. Our formulation recovers the Top-1 deferral policy of prior
score-based methods as a special case, and we prove that our surrogate is both
Bayes-consistent and $\mathcal{H}$-consistent under mild assumptions. We
further introduce an adaptive variant, Top-$k(x)$, which dynamically selects
the number of consulted entities per input to balance predictive accuracy and
consultation cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN confirm that our one-stage
Top-$k$ method strictly outperforms Top-1 deferral, while Top-$k(x)$ achieves
superior accuracy-cost trade-offs by tailoring allocations to input complexity.

Abstract: Incremental learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model learns from
a sequential stream of tasks. This setting poses a key challenge: balancing
plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (preserving past knowledge).
Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a branch of AutoML, automates the design of
the architecture of Deep Neural Networks and has shown success in static
settings. However, existing NAS-based approaches to incremental learning often
rely on expanding the model at every task, making them impractical in
resource-constrained environments. In this work, we introduce SEAL, a NAS-based
framework tailored for data-incremental learning, a scenario where disjoint
data samples arrive sequentially and are not stored for future access. SEAL
adapts the model structure dynamically by expanding it only when necessary,
based on a capacity estimation metric. Stability is preserved through
cross-distillation training after each expansion step. The NAS component
jointly searches for both the architecture and the optimal expansion policy.
Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SEAL effectively
reduces forgetting and enhances accuracy while maintaining a lower model size
compared to prior methods. These results highlight the promise of combining NAS
and selective expansion for efficient, adaptive learning in incremental
scenarios.

Conclusion: FGU是一种有效的公平图遗忘方法，解决了偏见问题，适用于多样化数据分布。

Abstract: Graph unlearning is a crucial approach for protecting user privacy by erasing
the influence of user data on trained graph models. Recent developments in
graph unlearning methods have primarily focused on maintaining model prediction
performance while removing user information. However, we have observed that
when user information is deleted from the model, the prediction distribution
across different sensitive groups often changes. Furthermore, graph models are
shown to be prone to amplifying biases, making the study of fairness in graph
unlearning particularly important. This raises the question: Does graph
unlearning actually introduce bias? Our findings indicate that the predictions
of post-unlearning models become highly correlated with sensitive attributes,
confirming the introduction of bias in the graph unlearning process. To address
this issue, we propose a fair graph unlearning method, FGU. To guarantee
privacy, FGU trains shard models on partitioned subgraphs, unlearns the
requested data from the corresponding subgraphs, and retrains the shard models
on the modified subgraphs. To ensure fairness, FGU employs a bi-level debiasing
process: it first enables shard-level fairness by incorporating a fairness
regularizer in the shard model retraining, and then achieves global-level
fairness by aligning all shard models to minimize global disparity. Our
experiments demonstrate that FGU achieves superior fairness while maintaining
privacy and accuracy. Additionally, FGU is robust to diverse unlearning
requests, ensuring fairness and utility performance across various data
distributions.

Abstract: While substantial research has been devoted to optimizing model performance,
convergence rates, and communication efficiency, the energy implications of
federated learning (FL) within Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)
scenarios are often overlooked in the existing literature. This study examines
the energy consumed during the FL process, focusing on three main
energy-intensive processes: pre-processing, communication, and local learning,
all contributing to the overall energy footprint. We rely on the observation
that device/client selection is crucial for speeding up the convergence of
model training in a distributed AIoT setting and propose two
clustering-informed methods. These clustering solutions are designed to group
AIoT devices with similar label distributions, resulting in clusters composed
of nearly heterogeneous devices. Hence, our methods alleviate the heterogeneity
often encountered in real-world distributed learning applications. Throughout
extensive numerical experimentation, we demonstrate that our clustering
strategies typically achieve high convergence rates while maintaining low
energy consumption when compared to other recent approaches available in the
literature.

Abstract: We investigate deep morphological neural networks (DMNNs). We demonstrate

empirically show that our proposed networks can be successfully trained, and
are more prunable than linear networks. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to successfully train DMNNs under such constraints, although the
generalization capabilities of our networks remain limited. Finally, we propose
a hybrid network architecture combining linear and morphological layers,
showing empirically that the inclusion of morphological layers significantly
accelerates the convergence of gradient descent with large batches.

and imbalanced distributions significantly challenge its effectiveness. This
study proposes a federated learning methodology that systematically addresses
data quality issues, including noise, class imbalance, and missing labels. The
proposed approach systematically enhances data integrity through adaptive noise

robust federated model training. Experimental evaluations conducted on
benchmark datasets (MNIST and Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate significant
improvements in federated model performance, particularly macro-F1 Score, under

framework carefully balances computational feasibility and substantial

Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial
optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP
problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the
black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model
the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the
network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high
temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low
temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and
facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the
temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and
improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard,
the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the
black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under
both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance
against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.

Conclusion: 这是首个整合社区结构、可迁移性和主动学习的MARL框架，具有理论保证。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
where the agents cooperate in a time-evolving network with latent community
structures and mixed memberships. Unlike traditional neighbor-based or fixed
interaction graphs, our community-based framework captures flexible and
abstract coordination patterns by allowing each agent to belong to multiple
overlapping communities. Each community maintains shared policy and value
functions, which are aggregated by individual agents according to personalized
membership weights. We also design actor-critic algorithms that exploit this
structure: agents inherit community-level estimates for policy updates and
value learning, enabling structured information sharing without requiring
access to other agents' policies. Importantly, our approach supports both
transfer learning by adapting to new agents or tasks via membership estimation,
and active learning by prioritizing uncertain communities during exploration.
Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees under linear function
approximation for both actor and critic updates. To our knowledge, this is the
first MARL framework that integrates community structure, transferability, and
active learning with provable guarantees.

Abstract: Traditional entropy-based methods - such as cross-entropy loss in
classification problems - have long been essential tools for quantifying
uncertainty and disorder in data and developing artificial intelligence
algorithms. However, the rapid growth of data across various domains has
introduced new challenges, particularly the integration of heterogeneous
datasets with intrinsic disparities. In this paper, we extend zentropy theory
into the data science domain by introducing intrinsic entropy, enabling more
effective learning from heterogeneous data sources. We propose a
zentropy-enhanced neural network (ZENN) that simultaneously learns both energy
and intrinsic entropy components, capturing the underlying structure of
multi-source data. To support this, we redesign the neural network architecture
to better reflect the intrinsic properties and variability inherent in diverse
datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ZENN on classification tasks and
energy landscape reconstructions, showing its superior generalization
capabilities and robustness-particularly in predicting high-order derivatives.
As a practical application, we employ ZENN to reconstruct the Helmholtz energy
landscape of Fe3Pt using data generated from DFT and capture key material
behaviors, including negative thermal expansion and the critical point in the
temperature-pressure space. Overall, our study introduces a novel approach for
data-driven machine learning grounded in zentropy theory, highlighting ZENN as
a versatile and robust deep learning framework for scientific problems

Abstract: As demand for intelligent services rises and edge devices become more
capable, distributed learning at the network edge has emerged as a key enabling
technology. While existing paradigms like federated learning (FL) and
decentralized FL (DFL) enable privacy-preserving distributed learning in many
scenarios, they face potential challenges in connectivity and synchronization
imposed by resource-constrained and infrastructure-less environments. While
more robust, gossip learning (GL) algorithms have generally been designed for
homogeneous data distributions and may not suit all contexts. This paper
introduces Chisme, a novel suite of protocols designed to address the
challenges of implementing robust intelligence in the network edge,
characterized by heterogeneous data distributions, episodic connectivity, and
lack of infrastructure. Chisme includes both synchronous DFL (Chisme-DFL) and
asynchronous GL (Chisme-GL) variants that enable collaborative yet
decentralized model training that considers underlying data heterogeneity. We
introduce a data similarity heuristic that allows agents to opportunistically
infer affinity with each other using the existing communication of model
updates in decentralized FL and GL. We leverage the heuristic to extend DFL's
model aggregation and GL's model merge mechanisms for better personalized
training while maintaining collaboration. While Chisme-DFL is a synchronous
decentralized approach whose resource utilization scales linearly with network
size, Chisme-GL is fully asynchronous and has a lower, constant resource
requirement independent of network size. We demonstrate that Chisme methods
outperform their standard counterparts in model training over distributed and
heterogeneous data in network scenarios ranging from less connected and
reliable networks to fully connected and lossless networks.

Abstract: Euclidean diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative
modeling across diverse domains, and they have been extended to manifold case
in recent advances. Instead of explicitly utilizing the structure of special
manifolds as studied in previous works, we investigate direct sampling of the
Euclidean diffusion models for general manifold-constrained data in this paper.
We reveal the multiscale singularity of the score function in the embedded
space of manifold, which hinders the accuracy of diffusion-generated samples.
We then present an elaborate theoretical analysis of the singularity structure
of the score function by separating it along the tangential and normal
directions of the manifold. To mitigate the singularity and improve the
sampling accuracy, we propose two novel methods: (1) Niso-DM, which introduces
non-isotropic noise along the normal direction to reduce scale discrepancies,
and (2) Tango-DM, which trains only the tangential component of the score
function using a tangential-only loss function. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our methods achieve superior performance on distributions over
various manifolds with complex geometries.

Conclusion: Long-CL框架有效缓解了长期持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，并通过新基准推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a long-term continual learning (CL) task, where a
model learns sequentially from a stream of vast tasks over time, acquiring new
knowledge while retaining previously learned information in a manner akin to
human learning. Unlike traditional CL settings, long-term CL involves handling
a significantly larger number of tasks, which exacerbates the issue of
catastrophic forgetting. Our work seeks to address two critical questions: 1)
How do existing CL methods perform in the context of long-term CL? and 2) How
can we mitigate the catastrophic forgetting that arises from prolonged
sequential updates? To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework
inspired by human memory mechanisms for long-term continual learning (Long-CL).
Specifically, we introduce a task-core memory management strategy to
efficiently index crucial memories and adaptively update them as learning
progresses. Additionally, we develop a long-term memory consolidation mechanism
that selectively retains hard and discriminative samples, ensuring robust
knowledge retention. To facilitate research in this area, we construct and
release two multi-modal and textual benchmarks, MMLongCL-Bench and
TextLongCL-Bench, providing a valuable resource for evaluating long-term CL
approaches. Experimental results show that Long-CL outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art by 7.4\% and 6.5\% AP on the two benchmarks, respectively,

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for time series data remains a critical
challenge in deep learning, with traditional pseudo-labeling strategies failing
to capture temporal patterns and channel-wise shifts between domains, producing
sub-optimal pseudo-labels. As such, we introduce TransPL, a novel approach that
addresses these limitations by modeling the joint distribution $P(\mathbf{X},
y)$ of the source domain through code transition matrices, where the codes are
derived from vector quantization (VQ) of time series patches. Our method
constructs class- and channel-wise code transition matrices from the source
domain and employs Bayes' rule for target domain adaptation, generating
pseudo-labels based on channel-wise weighted class-conditional likelihoods.
TransPL offers three key advantages: explicit modeling of temporal transitions
and channel-wise shifts between different domains, versatility towards
different UDA scenarios (e.g., weakly-supervised UDA), and explainable
pseudo-label generation. We validate TransPL's effectiveness through extensive
analysis on four time series UDA benchmarks and confirm that it consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art pseudo-labeling methods by a strong margin (6.1%
accuracy improvement, 4.9% F1 improvement), while providing interpretable
insights into the domain adaptation process through its learned code transition
matrices.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) endure catastrophic forgetting, undermining their
capacity to preserve previously acquired knowledge amid the assimilation of
novel information. Rehearsal-based techniques revisit historical examples,
adopted as a principal strategy to alleviate this phenomenon. However, memory
explosion and privacy infringements impose significant constraints on their
utility. Non-Exemplar methods circumvent the prior issues through Prototype
Replay (PR), yet feature drift presents new challenges. In this paper, our
empirical findings reveal that Prototype Contrastive Learning (PCL) exhibits
less pronounced drift than conventional PR. Drawing upon PCL, we propose
Instance-Prototype Affinity Learning (IPAL), a novel paradigm for Non-Exemplar
Continual Graph Learning (NECGL). Exploiting graph structural information, we
formulate Topology-Integrated Gaussian Prototypes (TIGP), guiding feature
distributions towards high-impact nodes to augment the model's capacity for
assimilating new knowledge. Instance-Prototype Affinity Distillation (IPAD)
safeguards task memory by regularizing discontinuities in class relationships.
Moreover, we embed a Decision Boundary Perception (DBP) mechanism within PCL,
fostering greater inter-class discriminability. Evaluations on four node
classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a better trade-off between
plasticity and stability.

Abstract: In cloud services, virtual machine (VM) scheduling is a typical Online
Dynamic Multidimensional Bin Packing (ODMBP) problem, characterized by
large-scale complexity and fluctuating demands. Traditional optimization
methods struggle to adapt to real-time changes, domain-expert-designed
heuristic approaches suffer from rigid strategies, and existing learning-based
methods often lack generalizability and interpretability. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes a hierarchical language agent framework named
MiCo, which provides a large language model (LLM)-driven heuristic design
paradigm for solving ODMBP. Specifically, ODMBP is formulated as a Semi-Markov
Decision Process with Options (SMDP-Option), enabling dynamic scheduling
through a two-stage architecture, i.e., Option Miner and Option Composer.
Option Miner utilizes LLMs to discover diverse and useful non-context-aware
strategies by interacting with constructed environments. Option Composer
employs LLMs to discover a composing strategy that integrates the
non-context-aware strategies with the contextual ones. Extensive experiments on
real-world enterprise datasets demonstrate that MiCo achieves a 96.9\%
competitive ratio in large-scale scenarios involving more than 10,000 virtual
machines. It maintains high performance even under nonstationary request flows
and diverse configurations, thus validating its effectiveness in complex and

Abstract: Injecting rule-based models like Random Forests into differentiable neural

tasks serve as independent auxiliary tasks. Our results show consistent and
significant performance improvement across all 19 molecular property prediction
tasks. For 16 out of 19 targets, the multitask Graph Transformer outperforms
the XGBoost single-task learner. This demonstrates that synthetic task
augmentation is an effective method for enhancing neural model performance in
multitask molecular property prediction without the need for feature injection
or pretraining.

Abstract: Federated learning enables the clients to collaboratively train a global
model, which is aggregated from local models. Due to the heterogeneous data
distributions over clients and data privacy in federated learning, it is
difficult to train local models to achieve a well-performed global model. In
this paper, we introduce the adaptability of local models, i.e., the average
performance of local models on data distributions over clients, and enhance the
performance of the global model by improving the adaptability of local models.
Since each client does not know the data distributions over other clients, the
adaptability of the local model cannot be directly optimized. First, we provide
the property of an appropriate local model which has good adaptability on the
data distributions over clients. Then, we formalize the property into the local
training objective with a constraint and propose a feasible solution to train
the local model. Extensive experiments on federated learning benchmarks
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the adaptability of local
models and achieves a well-performed global model that consistently outperforms
the baseline methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative training while ensuring data
privacy across distributed edge devices, making it a popular solution for
privacy-sensitive applications. However, FL faces significant challenges due to
statistical heterogeneity, particularly domain heterogeneity, which impedes the
global mode's convergence. In this study, we introduce a new framework to
address this challenge by improving the generalization ability of the FL global
model under domain heterogeneity, using prototype augmentation. Specifically,
we introduce FedAPC (Federated Augmented Prototype Contrastive Learning), a
prototype-based FL framework designed to enhance feature diversity and model
robustness. FedAPC leverages prototypes derived from the mean features of
augmented data to capture richer representations. By aligning local features
with global prototypes, we enable the model to learn meaningful semantic
features while reducing overfitting to any specific domain. Experimental
results on the Office-10 and Digits datasets illustrate that our framework
outperforms SOTA baselines, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: The charging scheduling problem of Electric Buses (EBs) is investigated based
on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is
conceived, where the time horizon includes multiple charging and operating
periods in a day, while each period is further divided into multiple time
steps. To overcome the challenge of long-range multi-phase planning with sparse
reward, we conceive Hierarchical DRL (HDRL) for decoupling the original MDP
into a high-level Semi-MDP (SMDP) and multiple low-level MDPs. The Hierarchical
Double Deep Q-Network (HDDQN)-Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm is
proposed for simultaneously solving the decision problems arising at different
temporal resolutions. As a result, the high-level agent learns an effective
policy for prescribing the charging targets for every charging period, while
the low-level agent learns an optimal policy for setting the charging power of
every time step within a single charging period, with the aim of minimizing the
charging costs while meeting the charging target. It is proved that the flat
policy constructed by superimposing the optimal high-level policy and the
optimal low-level policy performs as well as the optimal policy of the original
MDP. Since jointly learning both levels of policies is challenging due to the
non-stationarity of the high-level agent and the sampling inefficiency of the
low-level agent, we divide the joint learning process into two phases and
exploit our new HER algorithm to manipulate the experience replay buffers for
both levels of agents. Numerical experiments are performed with the aid of
real-world data to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，能够恢复比现有技术大两个数量级的数据批次。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了数据重构攻击的能力，对联邦学习隐私保护提出了新的挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of machine learning
models across distributed clients without sharing raw data, ostensibly
preserving data privacy. Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed critical
vulnerabilities in FL, showing that a malicious central server can manipulate
model updates to reconstruct clients' private training data. Existing data
reconstruction attacks have important limitations: they often rely on
assumptions about the clients' data distribution or their efficiency
significantly degrades when batch sizes exceed just a few tens of samples.
  In this work, we introduce a novel data reconstruction attack that overcomes
these limitations. Our method leverages a new geometric perspective on fully
connected layers to craft malicious model parameters, enabling the perfect
recovery of arbitrarily large data batches in classification tasks without any
prior knowledge of clients' data. Through extensive experiments on both image
and tabular datasets, we demonstrate that our attack outperforms existing
methods and achieves perfect reconstruction of data batches two orders of
magnitude larger than the state of the art.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enhances privacy and reduces communication cost for
resource-constrained edge clients by supporting distributed model training at
the edge. However, the heterogeneous nature of such devices produces diverse,
non-independent, and identically distributed (non-IID) data, making the
detection of backdoor attacks more challenging. In this paper, we propose a
novel federated representative-attention-based defense mechanism, named FeRA,
that leverages cross-client attention over internal feature representations to
distinguish benign from malicious clients. FeRA computes an anomaly score based
on representation reconstruction errors, effectively identifying clients whose
internal activations significantly deviate from the group consensus. Our
evaluation demonstrates FeRA's robustness across various FL scenarios,
including challenging non-IID data distributions typical of edge devices.
Experimental results show that it effectively reduces backdoor attack success
rates while maintaining high accuracy on the main task. The method is
model-agnostic, attack-agnostic, and does not require labeled reference data,
making it well suited to heterogeneous and resource-limited edge deployments.

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) often suffers from false negatives, which

the false negative issue usually rely on human prior knowledge, still leading
GCL to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel Negative Metric

Metric Network (NMN) to build a negative metric space, in which false negatives
can be distinguished better from true negatives based on their distance to
anchor node. To overcome the lack of explicit supervision signals for NML, we
propose a joint training scheme with bi-level optimization objective, which
implicitly utilizes the self-supervision signals to iteratively optimize the
encoder and the negative metric network. The solid theoretical analysis and the
extensive experiments conducted on widely used benchmarks verify the
superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: Randomness is ubiquitous in many applications across data science and machine
learning. Remarkably, systems composed of random components often display
emergent global behaviors that appear deterministic, manifesting a transition
from microscopic disorder to macroscopic organization. In this work, we
introduce a theoretical model for studying the emergence of collective
behaviors in ensembles of random classifiers. We argue that, if the ensemble is
weighted through the Gibbs measure defined by adopting the classification loss
as an energy, then there exists a finite temperature parameter for the
distribution such that the classification is optimal, with respect to the loss
(or the energy). Interestingly, for the case in which samples are generated by
a Gaussian distribution and labels are constructed by employing a teacher
perceptron, we analytically prove and numerically confirm that such optimal
temperature does not depend neither on the teacher classifier (which is, by
construction of the learning problem, unknown), nor on the number of random
classifiers, highlighting the universal nature of the observed behavior.
Experiments on the MNIST dataset underline the relevance of this phenomenon in
high-quality, noiseless, datasets. Finally, a physical analogy allows us to
shed light on the self-organizing nature of the studied phenomenon.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are well-established as a principled approach
to probabilistic unsupervised learning with neural networks. Typically, an
encoder network defines the parameters of a Gaussian distributed latent space
from which we can sample and pass realizations to a decoder network. This model
is trained to reconstruct its inputs and is optimized through the evidence
lower bound. In recent years, discrete latent spaces have grown in popularity,
suggesting that they may be a natural choice for many data modalities (e.g.
text). In this tutorial, we provide a rigorous, yet practical, introduction to
discrete variational autoencoders -- specifically, VAEs in which the latent
space is made up of latent variables that follow a categorical distribution. We
assume only a basic mathematical background with which we carefully derive each
step from first principles. From there, we develop a concrete training recipe
and provide an example implementation, hosted at

Conclusion: SCGP是一种高效且可扩展的图神经网络增强方法，适用于实时和资源受限的应用。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework for learning over
graph-structured data, yet their expressive capacity is often hindered by
over-squashing, wherein information from distant nodes is compressed into
fixed-size vectors. Existing solutions, including graph rewiring and
bottleneck-resistant architectures such as Cayley and expander graphs, avoid
this problem but introduce scalability bottlenecks. In particular, the Cayley
graphs constructed over $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ exhibit strong theoretical
properties, yet suffer from cubic node growth $O(n^3)$, leading to high memory
usage. To address this, this work introduces Schrier-Coset Graph Propagation
(SCGP), a group-theoretic augmentation method that enriches node features
through Schreier-coset embeddings without altering the input graph topology.
SCGP embeds bottleneck-free connectivity patterns into a compact feature space,
improving long-range message passing while maintaining computational
efficiency. Empirical evaluations across standard node and graph classification
benchmarks demonstrate that SCGP achieves performance comparable to, or
exceeding, expander graph and rewired GNN baselines. Furthermore, SCGP exhibits
particular advantages in processing hierarchical and modular graph structures,
offering reduced inference latency, improved scalability, and a low memory
footprint, making it suitable for real-time and resource-constrained
applications.

Abstract: We study the relationship between gradient-based optimization of parametric
models (e.g., neural networks) and optimization of linear combinations of
random features. Our main result shows that if a parametric model can be
learned using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (bSGD) without making
assumptions about the data distribution, then with high probability, the target
function can also be approximated using a polynomial-sized combination of
random features. The size of this combination depends on the number of gradient
steps and numerical precision used in the bSGD process. This finding reveals
fundamental limitations of distribution-free learning in neural networks
trained by gradient descent, highlighting why making assumptions about data
distributions is often crucial in practice. Along the way, we also introduce a
new theoretical framework called average probabilistic dimension complexity
(adc), which extends the probabilistic dimension complexity developed by Kamath
et al. (2020). We prove that adc has a polynomial relationship with statistical
query dimension, and use this relationship to demonstrate an infinite
separation between adc and standard dimension complexity.

Abstract: This paper presents a risk-aware safe reinforcement learning (RL) control
design for stochastic discrete-time linear systems. Rather than using a safety
certifier to myopically intervene with the RL controller, a risk-informed safe
controller is also learned besides the RL controller, and the RL and safe
controllers are combined together. Several advantages come along with this
approach: 1) High-confidence safety can be certified without relying on a
high-fidelity system model and using limited data available, 2) Myopic
interventions and convergence to an undesired equilibrium can be avoided by
deciding on the contribution of two stabilizing controllers, and 3) highly
efficient and computationally tractable solutions can be provided by optimizing
over a scalar decision variable and linear programming polyhedral sets. To
learn safe controllers with a large invariant set, piecewise affine controllers
are learned instead of linear controllers. To this end, the closed-loop system
is first represented using collected data, a decision variable, and noise. The
effect of the decision variable on the variance of the safe violation of the
closed-loop system is formalized. The decision variable is then designed such
that the probability of safety violation for the learned closed-loop system is
minimized. It is shown that this control-oriented approach reduces the data
requirements and can also reduce the variance of safety violations. Finally, to
integrate the safe and RL controllers, a new data-driven interpolation
technique is introduced. This method aims to maintain the RL agent's optimal
implementation while ensuring its safety within environments characterized by
noise. The study concludes with a simulation example that serves to validate
the theoretical results.

Abstract: Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is challenging when
the likelihood function is irregular and expensive to compute. We explore
several sampling algorithms that make use of subset evaluations to reduce
computational overhead. We adapt the subset samplers for this setting where
gradient information is not available or is unreliable. To achieve this, we
introduce data-driven proxies in place of Taylor expansions and define a novel
computation-cost aware adaptive controller. We undertake an extensive
evaluation for a challenging disease modelling task and a configurable task
with similar irregularity in the likelihood surface. We find our improved
version of Hierarchical Importance with Nested Training Samples (HINTS), with
adaptive proposals and a data-driven proxy, obtains the best sampling error in
a fixed computational budget. We conclude that subset evaluations can provide
cheap and naturally-tempered exploration, while a data-driven proxy can
pre-screen proposals successfully in explored regions of the state space. These
two elements combine through hierarchical delayed acceptance to achieve
efficient, exact sampling.

Abstract: Multi-modal and high-dimensional posteriors present significant challenges
for variational inference, causing mode-seeking behavior and collapse despite
the theoretical expressiveness of normalizing flows. Traditional annealing
methods require temperature schedules and hyperparameter tuning, falling short
of the goal of truly black-box variational inference. We introduce FlowVAT, a
conditional tempering approach for normalizing flow variational inference that
addresses these limitations. Our method tempers both the base and target
distributions simultaneously, maintaining affine-invariance under tempering. By
conditioning the normalizing flow on temperature, we leverage overparameterized
neural networks' generalization capabilities to train a single flow
representing the posterior across a range of temperatures. This preserves modes
identified at higher temperatures when sampling from the variational posterior
at $T = 1$, mitigating standard variational methods' mode-seeking behavior. In
experiments with 2, 10, and 20 dimensional multi-modal distributions, FlowVAT
outperforms traditional and adaptive annealing methods, finding more modes and
achieving better ELBO values, particularly in higher dimensions where existing
approaches fail. Our method requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and does not
require an annealing schedule, advancing toward fully-automatic black-box
variational inference for complicated posteriors.

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making in batched nonparametric contextual

number of batches. Motivated by constraints in domains such as medicine and
marketing -- where online feedback is limited -- we propose a nonparametric
algorithm that combines adaptive k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) regression with the
upper confidence bound (UCB) principle. Our method, BaNk-UCB, is fully
nonparametric, adapts to the context dimension, and is simple to implement.
Unlike prior work relying on parametric or binning-based estimators, BaNk-UCB
uses local geometry to estimate rewards and adaptively balances exploration and
exploitation. We provide near-optimal regret guarantees under standard
Lipschitz smoothness and margin assumptions, using a theoretically motivated
batch schedule that balances regret across batches and achieves minimax-optimal
rates. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that BaNk-UCB consistently outperforms binning-based baselines.

Abstract: Graph learning, or network inference, is a prominent problem in graph signal
processing (GSP). GSP generalizes the Fourier transform to non-Euclidean
domains, and graph learning is pivotal to applying GSP when these domains are
unknown. With the recent prevalence of multi-way data, there has been growing
interest in product graphs that naturally factorize dependencies across
different ways. However, the types of graph products that can be learned are
still limited for modeling diverse dependency structures. In this paper, we
study the problem of learning a Kronecker-structured product graph from smooth
signals. Unlike the more commonly used Cartesian product, the Kronecker product
models dependencies in a more intricate, non-separable way, but posits harder
constraints on the graph learning problem. To tackle this non-convex problem,
we propose an alternating scheme to optimize each factor graph and provide
theoretical guarantees for its asymptotic convergence. The proposed algorithm
is also modified to learn factor graphs of the strong product. We conduct
experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs and demonstrate our approach's
efficacy and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: KQT-EWMA是一种实用且灵活的非参数变化检测方法，适用于多元数据流监测。

Abstract: We present Kernel-QuantTree Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (KQT-EWMA),
a non-parametric change-detection algorithm that combines the Kernel-QuantTree
(KQT) histogram and the EWMA statistic to monitor multivariate data streams
online. The resulting monitoring scheme is very flexible, since histograms can
be used to model any stationary distribution, and practical, since the
distribution of test statistics does not depend on the distribution of
datastream in stationary conditions (non-parametric monitoring). KQT-EWMA
enables controlling false alarms by operating at a pre-determined Average Run
Length ($ARL_0$), which measures the expected number of stationary samples to
be monitored before triggering a false alarm. The latter peculiarity is in
contrast with most non-parametric change-detection tests, which rarely can
control the $ARL_0$ a priori. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that KQT-EWMA can control $ARL_0$ while achieving
detection delays comparable to or lower than state-of-the-art methods designed
to work in the same conditions.

Abstract: Quantum-classical Hybrid Machine Learning (QHML) models are recognized for
their robust performance and high generalization ability even for relatively
small datasets. These qualities offer unique advantages for anti-cancer drug
response prediction, where the number of available samples is typically small.
However, such hybrid models appear to be very sensitive to the data encoding
used at the interface of a neural network and a quantum circuit, with
suboptimal choices leading to stability issues. To address this problem, we
propose a novel strategy that uses a normalization function based on a
moderated gradient version of the $\tanh$. This method transforms the outputs
of the neural networks without concentrating them at the extreme value ranges.
Our idea was evaluated on a dataset of gene expression and drug response
measurements for various cancer cell lines, where we compared the prediction
performance of a classical deep learning model and several QHML models. These
results confirmed that QHML performed better than the classical models when
data was optimally normalized. This study opens up new possibilities for
biomedical data analysis using quantum computers.

Abstract: Depth estimation and scene segmentation are two important tasks in
intelligent transportation systems. A joint modeling of these two tasks will
reduce the requirement for both the storage and training efforts. This work
explores how the multi-task distillation could be used to improve such unified
modeling. While existing solutions transfer multiple teachers' knowledge in a
static way, we propose a self-adaptive distillation method that can dynamically
adjust the knowledge amount from each teacher according to the student's
current learning ability. Furthermore, as multiple teachers exist, the
student's gradient update direction in the distillation is more prone to be
erroneous where knowledge forgetting may occur. To avoid this, we propose a
knowledge trajectory to record the most essential information that a model has
learnt in the past, based on which a trajectory-based distillation loss is
designed to guide the student to follow the learning curve similarly in a
cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmarking datasets
including Cityscapes and NYU-v2. Compared to the state-of-the-art solutions,
our method achieves a clearly improvement. The code is provided in the

Abstract: This work investigates the problem of best arm identification for multi-agent
multi-armed bandits. We consider $N$ agents grouped into $M$ clusters, where
each cluster solves a stochastic bandit problem. The mapping between agents and
bandits is a priori unknown. Each bandit is associated with $K$ arms, and the
goal is to identify the best arm for each agent under a $\delta$-probably
correct ($\delta$-PC) framework, while minimizing sample complexity and
communication overhead.
  We propose two novel algorithms: Clustering then Best Arm Identification
(Cl-BAI) and Best Arm Identification then Clustering (BAI-Cl). Cl-BAI uses a
two-phase approach that first clusters agents based on the bandit problems they
are learning, followed by identifying the best arm for each cluster. BAI-Cl
reverses the sequence by identifying the best arms first and then clustering
agents accordingly. Both algorithms leverage the successive elimination
framework to ensure computational efficiency and high accuracy.
  We establish $\delta$-PC guarantees for both methods, derive bounds on their
sample complexity, and provide a lower bound for this problem class. Moreover,
when $M$ is small (a constant), we show that the sample complexity of a variant
of BAI-Cl is minimax optimal in an order-wise sense. Experiments on synthetic
and real-world datasets (MovieLens, Yelp) demonstrate the superior performance
of the proposed algorithms in terms of sample and communication efficiency,
particularly in settings where $M \ll N$.

Abstract: The emergence of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (HQML) models
opens new horizons of computational intelligence but their fundamental
complexity frequently leads to black box behavior that undermines transparency
and reliability in their application. Although XAI for quantum systems still in
its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local
explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ
quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus
of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an
explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model
entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use
of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum
transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result
shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as
well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI
techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more
significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY.
The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route
to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting
greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use
of quantum-enhanced AI technology.

Abstract: In the photolithographic process vital to semiconductor manufacturing,
various types of defects appear during EUV pattering. Due to ever-shrinking
pattern size, these defects are extremely small and cause false or missed
detection during inspection. Specifically, the lack of defect-annotated quality
data with good representation of smaller defects has prohibited deployment of
deep learning based defect detection models in fabrication lines. To resolve
the problem of data unavailability, we artificially generate scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of line patterns with known distribution of defects and
autonomously annotate them. We then employ state-of-the-art object detection
models to investigate defect detection performance as a function of defect
size, much smaller than the pitch width. We find that the real-time object
detector YOLOv8 has the best mean average precision of 96% as compared to
EfficientNet, 83%, and SSD, 77%, with the ability to detect smaller defects. We
report the smallest defect size that can be detected reliably. When tested on
real SEM data, the YOLOv8 model correctly detected 84.6% of Bridge defects and
78.3% of Break defects across all relevant instances. These promising results
suggest that synthetic data can be used as an alternative to real-world data in
order to develop robust machine-learning models.

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a key principle underlying learning in biological neural
networks. It postulates that synaptic changes occur locally, depending on the
activities of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. While Hebbian learning based on
neuronal firing rates is well explored, much less is known about learning rules
that account for precise spike-timing. We relate a Hebbian
spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule to noisy gradient descent with respect
to a natural loss function on the probability simplex. This connection allows
us to prove that the learning rule eventually identifies the presynaptic neuron
with the highest activity. We also discover an intrinsic connection to noisy
mirror descent.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Electric Buses (EBs) represents a significant step
toward sustainable development. By utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) systems,
charging stations can autonomously determine charging schedules based on
real-time data. However, optimizing EB charging schedules remains a critical
challenge due to uncertainties in travel time, energy consumption, and
fluctuating electricity prices. Moreover, to address real-world complexities,
charging policies must make decisions efficiently across multiple time scales
and remain scalable for large EB fleets. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) approach that reformulates the
original Markov Decision Process (MDP) into two augmented MDPs. To solve these
MDPs and enable multi-timescale decision-making, we introduce a novel HDRL
algorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization
Enhancement (DAC-MAPPO-E). Scalability challenges of the Double Actor-Critic
(DAC) algorithm for large-scale EB fleets are addressed through enhancements at
both decision levels. At the high level, we redesign the decentralized actor
network and integrate an attention mechanism to extract relevant global state
information for each EB, decreasing the size of neural networks. At the low
level, the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is
incorporated into the DAC framework, enabling decentralized and coordinated
charging power decisions, reducing computational complexity and enhancing
convergence speed. Extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate the
superior performance and scalability of DAC-MAPPO-E in optimizing EB fleet
charging schedules.

Abstract: Decentralized optimization has become vital for leveraging distributed data
without central control, enhancing scalability and privacy. However, practical
deployments face fundamental challenges due to heterogeneous computation speeds
and unpredictable communication delays. This paper introduces a refined model
of Asynchronous Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (ADSGD) under
practical assumptions of bounded computation and communication times. To
understand the convergence of ADSGD, we first analyze Asynchronous Stochastic
Block Coordinate Descent (ASBCD) as a tool, and then show that ADSGD converges
under computation-delay-independent step sizes. The convergence result is
established without assuming bounded data heterogeneity. Empirical experiments
reveal that ADSGD outperforms existing methods in wall-clock convergence time
across various scenarios. With its simplicity, efficiency in memory and
communication, and resilience to communication and computation delays, ADSGD is
well-suited for real-world decentralized learning tasks.

absence of a large IA image datasets. Existing shape generation methods
struggle to capture realistic IA features and ignore the relationship between
IA pouches and parent vessels, limiting physiological realism and their
generation cannot be controlled to have specific morphological measurements. We
propose AneuG, a two-stage Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based IA mesh
generator. In the first stage, AneuG generates low-dimensional Graph Harmonic
Deformation (GHD) tokens to encode and reconstruct aneurysm pouch shapes,
constrained to morphing energy statistics truths. GHD enables more accurate
shape encoding than alternatives. In the second stage, AneuG generates parent
vessels conditioned on GHD tokens, by generating vascular centreline and
propagating the cross-section. AneuG's IA shape generation can further be
conditioned to have specific clinically relevant morphological measurements.
This is useful for studies to understand shape variations represented by
clinical measurements, and for flow simulation studies to understand effects of
specific clinical shape parameters on fluid dynamics. Source code and
implementation details are available at

Abstract: Clouds and precipitation are important for understanding weather and climate.
Simulating clouds and precipitation with traditional numerical weather
prediction is challenging because of the sub-grid parameterizations required.
Machine learning has been explored for forecasting clouds and precipitation,
but early machine learning methods often created blurry forecasts. In this
paper we explore a newer method, named score-based diffusion, to nowcast (zero
to three hour forecast) clouds and precipitation. We discuss the background and
intuition of score-based diffusion models - thus providing a starting point for
the community - while exploring the methodology's use for nowcasting
geostationary infrared imagery. We experiment with three main types of
diffusion models: a standard score-based diffusion model (Diff); a residual
correction diffusion model (CorrDiff); and a latent diffusion model (LDM). Our
results show that the diffusion models are able to not only advect existing
clouds, but also generate and decay clouds, including convective initiation.
These results are surprising because the forecasts are initiated with only the
past 20 mins of infrared satellite imagery. A case study qualitatively shows
the preservation of high resolution features longer into the forecast than a
conventional mean-squared error trained U-Net. The best of the three diffusion
models tested was the CorrDiff approach, outperforming all other diffusion
models, the traditional U-Net, and a persistence forecast by one to two kelvin
on root mean squared error. The diffusion models also enable out-of-the-box
ensemble generation, which shows skillful calibration, with the spread of the
ensemble correlating well to the error.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of pure component physiochemical properties is crucial
for process integration, multiscale modeling, and optimization. In this work,
an enhanced framework for pure component property prediction by using
explainable machine learning methods is proposed. In this framework, the
molecular representation method based on the connectivity matrix effectively
considers atomic bonding relationships to automatically generate features. The
supervised machine learning model random forest is applied for feature ranking
and pooling. The adjusted R2 is introduced to penalize the inclusion of
additional features, providing an assessment of the true contribution of
features. The prediction results for normal boiling point (Tb), liquid molar
volume, critical temperature (Tc) and critical pressure (Pc) obtained using
Artificial Neural Network and Gaussian Process Regression models confirm the
accuracy of the molecular representation method. Comparison with GC based
models shows that the root-mean-square error on the test set can be reduced by
up to 83.8%. To enhance the interpretability of the model, a feature analysis
method based on Shapley values is employed to determine the contribution of
each feature to the property predictions. The results indicate that using the
feature pooling method reduces the number of features from 13316 to 100 without
compromising model accuracy. The feature analysis results for Tb, Tc, and Pc
confirms that different molecular properties are influenced by different
structural features, aligning with mechanistic interpretations. In conclusion,
the proposed framework is demonstrated to be feasible and provides a solid
foundation for mixture component reconstruction and process integration
modelling.

Result: I2I网络实现了更快、更准确的参数估计，适用于复杂非平稳SAR模型。

Conclusion: I2I网络为SAR模型的参数估计提供了高效替代方案，尤其适用于大规模非平稳数据。

Abstract: In many scientific and industrial applications, we are given a handful of
instances (a 'small ensemble') of a spatially distributed quantity (a 'field')
but would like to acquire many more. For example, a large ensemble of global
temperature sensitivity fields from a climate model can help farmers, insurers,
and governments plan appropriately. When acquiring more data is prohibitively
expensive -- as is the case with climate models -- statistical emulation offers
an efficient alternative for simulating synthetic yet realistic fields.
However, parameter inference using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is
computationally prohibitive, especially for large, non-stationary fields. Thus,
many recent works train neural networks to estimate parameters given spatial
fields as input, sidestepping MLE completely. In this work we focus on a
popular class of parametric, spatially autoregressive (SAR) models. We make a
simple yet impactful observation; because the SAR parameters can be arranged on
a regular grid, both inputs (spatial fields) and outputs (model parameters) can
be viewed as images. Using this insight, we demonstrate that image-to-image
(I2I) networks enable faster and more accurate parameter estimation for a class
of non-stationary SAR models with unprecedented complexity.

Abstract: In the context of mobile navigation in unstructured environments, the
predominant approach entails the avoidance of obstacles. The prevailing path
planning algorithms are contingent upon deviating from the intended path for an
indefinite duration and returning to the closest point on the route after the
obstacle is left behind spatially. However, avoiding an obstacle on a path that
will be used repeatedly by multiple agents can hinder long-term efficiency and
lead to a lasting reliance on an active path planning system. In this study, we
propose an alternative approach to mobile navigation in unstructured
environments by leveraging the manipulation capabilities of a robotic
manipulator mounted on top of a mobile robot. Our proposed framework integrates
exteroceptive and proprioceptive feedback to assess the push affordance of
obstacles, facilitating their repositioning rather than avoidance. While our
preliminary visual estimation takes into account the characteristics of both
the obstacle and the surface it relies on, the push affordance estimation
module exploits the force feedback obtained by interacting with the obstacle
via a robotic manipulator as the guidance signal. The objective of our
navigation approach is to enhance the efficiency of routes utilized by multiple
agents over extended periods by reducing the overall time spent by a fleet in
environments where autonomous infrastructure development is imperative, such as
lunar or Martian surfaces.

Conclusion: AACT系统有效缓解了SOC分析师的警报疲劳，提高了恶意威胁的识别效率。

Abstract: Enterprise networks are growing ever larger with a rapidly expanding attack
surface, increasing the volume of security alerts generated from security
controls. Security Operations Centre (SOC) analysts triage these alerts to
identify malicious activity, but they struggle with alert fatigue due to the
overwhelming number of benign alerts. Organisations are turning to managed SOC
providers, where the problem is amplified by context switching and limited
visibility into business processes.
  A novel system, named AACT, is introduced that automates SOC workflows by
learning from analysts' triage actions on cybersecurity alerts. It accurately
predicts triage decisions in real time, allowing benign alerts to be closed
automatically and critical ones prioritised. This reduces the SOC queue
allowing analysts to focus on the most severe, relevant or ambiguous threats.
The system has been trained and evaluated on both real SOC data and an open
dataset, obtaining high performance in identifying malicious alerts from benign
alerts.
  Additionally, the system has demonstrated high accuracy in a real SOC
environment, reducing alerts shown to analysts by 61% over six months, with a
low false negative rate of 1.36% over millions of alerts.

its ability to handle unexpected disturbances such as asymmetric drag and an
off-center payload. We assess the agent's performance under these perturbations
in both simulation and real-world experiments, quantifying performance
degradation and benchmarking it against an MPC baseline. Results indicate that
the DRL agent performs reliably despite significant disturbances. Along with

Abstract: Boltzmann Generators have emerged as a promising machine learning tool for
generating samples from equilibrium distributions of molecular systems using
Normalizing Flows and importance weighting. Recently, Flow Matching has helped
speed up Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs), scale them to more complex
molecular systems, and minimize the length of the flow integration
trajectories. We investigate the benefits of using path gradients to fine-tune
CNFs initially trained by Flow Matching, in the setting where a target energy
is known. Our experiments show that this hybrid approach yields up to a
threefold increase in sampling efficiency for molecular systems, all while
using the same model, a similar computational budget and without the need for
additional sampling. Furthermore, by measuring the length of the flow
trajectories during fine-tuning, we show that path gradients largely preserve
the learned structure of the flow.

Abstract: TV customers today face many choices from many live channels and on-demand
services. Providing a personalised experience that saves customers time when
discovering content is essential for TV providers. However, a reliable
understanding of their behaviour and preferences is key. When creating
personalised recommendations for TV, the biggest challenge is understanding
viewing behaviour within households when multiple people are watching. The
objective is to detect and combine individual profiles to make
better-personalised recommendations for group viewing. Our challenge is that we
have little explicit information about who is watching the devices at any time
(individuals or groups). Also, we do not have a way to combine more than one
individual profile to make better recommendations for group viewing. We propose
a novel framework using a Gaussian mixture model averaging to obtain point
estimates for the number of household TV profiles and a Bayesian random walk
model to introduce uncertainty. We applied our approach using data from real
customers whose TV-watching data totalled approximately half a million
observations. Our results indicate that combining our framework with the
selected features provides a means to estimate the number of household TV
profiles and their characteristics, including shifts over time and
quantification of uncertainty.

Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional
stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with
long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such
systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer
trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a
nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex
duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables (such as
spatiotemporal correlation functions). It does not require reconstruction of
high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor any special
assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. It may be used to
compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from
different kinds of interactions, and it has an intuitive physical
interpretation as a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We demonstrate its
numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins
and a large neural spike-train dataset.

Convolutional Networks (TCN) for sequential feature extraction, Multi-Layer
Perceptrons (MLP) for nonlinear interactions, and an Attention mechanism for
dynamic feature weighting. The dataset used covers over 50,000 records of Hass
avocado sales across the U.S. from 2015 to 2018, including variables such as
sales volume, average price, time, region, weather, and variety type, collected
from point-of-sale systems and the Hass Avocado Board. After systematic
preprocessing, including missing value imputation and feature normalization,
the proposed model was trained and evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate
that the TCN-MLP-Attention model achieves excellent predictive performance,
with an RMSE of 1.23 and an MSE of 1.51, outperforming traditional methods.
This research provides a scalable and effective approach for time series

Abstract: This study presents a machine learning-based framework for heart disease
prediction using the heart-disease dataset, comprising 303 samples with 14
features. The methodology involves data preprocessing, model training, and
evaluation using three classifiers: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), and Random Forest. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV and
RandomizedSearchCV was employed to enhance model performance. The Random Forest
classifier outperformed other models, achieving an accuracy of 91% and an
F1-score of 0.89. Evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and
confusion matrix, revealed balanced performance across classes. The proposed
model demonstrates strong potential for aiding clinical decision-making by
effectively predicting heart disease. Limitations such as dataset size and
generalizability underscore the need for future studies using larger and more
diverse datasets. This work highlights the utility of machine learning in
healthcare, offering insights for further advancements in predictive
diagnostics.

Abstract: Monitoring feeding behaviour is a relevant task for efficient herd management
and the effective use of available resources in grazing cattle. The ability to
automatically recognise animals' feeding activities through the identification
of specific jaw movements allows for the improvement of diet formulation, as
well as early detection of metabolic problems and symptoms of animal
discomfort, among other benefits. The use of sensors to obtain signals for such
monitoring has become popular in the last two decades. The most frequently
employed sensors include accelerometers, microphones, and cameras, each with
its own set of advantages and drawbacks. An unexplored aspect is the
simultaneous use of multiple sensors with the aim of combining signals in order
to enhance the precision of the estimations. In this direction, this work
introduces a deep neural network based on the fusion of acoustic and inertial
signals, composed of convolutional, recurrent, and dense layers. The main
advantage of this model is the combination of signals through the automatic
extraction of features independently from each of them. The model has emerged
from an exploration and comparison of different neural network architectures
proposed in this work, which carry out information fusion at different levels.
Feature-level fusion has outperformed data and decision-level fusion by at
least a 0.14 based on the F1-score metric. Moreover, a comparison with
state-of-the-art machine learning methods is presented, including traditional
and deep learning approaches. The proposed model yielded an F1-score value of
0.802, representing a 14% increase compared to previous methods. Finally,
results from an ablation study and post-training quantization evaluation are
also reported.

Abstract: Developing bioactive molecules remains a central, time- and cost-heavy
challenge in drug discovery, particularly for novel targets lacking structural
or functional data. Pharmacophore modeling presents an alternative for
capturing the key features required for molecular bioactivity against a
biological target. In this work, we present PharmaDiff, a

PharmaDiff employs a transformer-based architecture to integrate an atom-based
representation of the 3D pharmacophore into the generative process, enabling
the precise generation of 3D molecular graphs that align with predefined
pharmacophore hypotheses. Through comprehensive testing, PharmaDiff
demonstrates superior performance in matching 3D pharmacophore constraints
compared to ligand-based drug design methods. Additionally, it achieves higher
docking scores across a range of proteins in structure-based drug design,
without the need for target protein structures. By integrating pharmacophore
modeling with 3D generative techniques, PharmaDiff offers a powerful and
flexible framework for rational drug design.

Abstract: Air pollution poses a significant threat to public health, causing or
exacerbating many respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, climate
change is bringing about more extreme weather events such as wildfires and
heatwaves, which can increase levels of pollution and worsen the effects of
pollution exposure. Recent advances in personal sensing have transformed the
collection of behavioural and physiological data, leading to the potential for
new improvements in healthcare. We wish to capitalise on this data, alongside
new capabilities in AI for making time series predictions, in order to monitor
and predict health outcomes for an individual. Thus, we present a novel
workflow for predicting personalised health responses to pollution by
integrating physiological data from wearable fitness devices with real-time
environmental exposures. The data is collected from various sources in a secure
and ethical manner, and is used to train an AI model to predict individual
health responses to pollution exposure within a cloud-based, modular framework.
We demonstrate that the AI model -- an Adversarial Autoencoder neural network
in this case -- accurately reconstructs time-dependent health signals and
captures nonlinear responses to pollution. Transfer learning is applied using
data from a personal smartwatch, which increases the generalisation abilities
of the AI model and illustrates the adaptability of the approach to real-world,
user-generated data.

Abstract: Dryland vegetation ecosystems are known to be susceptible to critical
transitions between alternative stable states when subjected to external
forcing. Such transitions are often discussed through the framework of
bifurcation theory, but the spatial patterning of vegetation, which is
characteristic of drylands, leads to dynamics that are much more complex and
diverse than local bifurcations. Recent methodological developments in Early
Warning Signal (EWS) detection have shown promise in identifying dynamical
signatures of oncoming critical transitions, with particularly strong
predictive capabilities being demonstrated by deep neural networks. However, a
machine learning model trained on synthetic examples is only useful if it can
effectively transfer to a test case of practical interest. These models'
capacity to generalize in this manner has been demonstrated for bifurcation
transitions, but it is not as well characterized for high-dimensional phase
transitions. This paper explores the successes and shortcomings of neural EWS
detection for spatially patterned phase transitions, and shows how these models
can be used to gain insight into where and how EWS-relevant information is
encoded in spatiotemporal dynamics. A few paradigmatic test systems are used to
illustrate how the capabilities of such models can be probed in a number of
ways, with particular attention to the performances of a number of proposed
statistical indicators for EWS and to the supplementary task of distinguishing
between abrupt and continuous transitions. Results reveal that model
performance often changes dramatically when training and test data sources are
interchanged, which offers new insight into the criteria for model
generalization.

Abstract: This paper introduces an automated framework WSW2.0 for analyzing vocal

.672 for speaker classification (child vs. teacher). Transcription quality is
moderate to high with word error rates of .119 for teachers and .238 for

correlations (ICC) with expert transcriptions for a range of classroom language
features. These include teacher and child mean utterance length, lexical
diversity, question asking, and responses to questions and other utterances,
which show absolute agreement intraclass correlations between .64 and .98. To

Abstract: Scrambling quantum systems have been demonstrated as effective substrates for
temporal information processing. While their role in providing rich feature
maps has been widely studied, a theoretical understanding of their performance
in temporal tasks is still lacking. Here we consider a general quantum
reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical
computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory
retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order
unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we
show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with
increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir
iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with
quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates
generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast,
the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both
reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove
exponential memory decays with iterations for local noisy channels. Proving
these results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding
concentration in temporal quantum learning models.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization involves selecting asset weights to minimize a
risk-reward objective, such as the portfolio variance in the classical
minimum-variance framework. Sparse portfolio selection extends this by imposing
a cardinality constraint: only $k$ assets from a universe of $p$ may be
included. The standard approach models this problem as a mixed-integer
quadratic program and relies on commercial solvers to find the optimal
solution. However, the computational costs of such methods increase
exponentially with $k$ and $p$, making them too slow for problems of even
moderate size. We propose a fast and scalable gradient-based approach that
transforms the combinatorial sparse selection problem into a constrained
continuous optimization task via Boolean relaxation, while preserving
equivalence with the original problem on the set of binary points. Our
algorithm employs a tunable parameter that transmutes the auxiliary objective
from a convex to a concave function. This allows a stable convex starting
point, followed by a controlled path toward a sparse binary solution as the
tuning parameter increases and the objective moves toward concavity. In
practice, our method matches commercial solvers in asset selection for most
instances and, in rare instances, the solution differs by a few assets whilst
showing a negligible error in portfolio variance.

Abstract: Modal synthesis methods are a long-standing approach for modelling
distributed musical systems. In some cases extensions are possible in order to
handle geometric nonlinearities. One such case is the high-amplitude vibration
of a string, where geometric nonlinear effects lead to perceptually important
effects including pitch glides and a dependence of brightness on striking
amplitude. A modal decomposition leads to a coupled nonlinear system of
ordinary differential equations. Recent work in applied machine learning
approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) has been used
to model lumped dynamic systems such as electronic circuits automatically from
data. In this work, we examine how modal decomposition can be combined with
neural ordinary differential equations for modelling distributed musical
systems. The proposed model leverages the analytical solution for linear
vibration of system's modes and employs a neural network to account for
nonlinear dynamic behaviour. Physical parameters of a system remain easily
accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the
network architecture. As an initial proof of concept, we generate synthetic
data for a nonlinear transverse string and show that the model can be trained
to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are
presented.

Abstract: Gas turbine engines represent complex highly nonlinear dynamical systems.
Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging as it requires
performance characteristics, that are not always available, and one often has
to make many simplifying assumptions. In this paper, the limitations of
conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally
linear parameter-varying models are discussed and addressed by employing
identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine
operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics were estimated using
the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous
part of the dynamics was mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman
eigenfunction space. The process included eigenvalue optimization using
metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based
eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model was validated against
an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear
feedback controller and a Kalman estimator were then designed in the
eigenfunction space and compared to the classical and gain-scheduled
proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control
approach. The eigenmode structure allowed targeting individual modes during the
optimization process, resulting in a better performance tuning. The results
showed that the Koopman-based controller outperformed the other benchmark
controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection, under
sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.

Abstract: Incorporating an autonomous auxiliary camera into robot-assisted minimally
invasive surgery (RAMIS) enhances spatial awareness and eliminates manual
viewpoint control. Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track
two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera
orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents
AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve
visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system
uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines
heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust
camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained
99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\pm$
2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally
efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study
(N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training
task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's
viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's
improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary
camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side
manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new
multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.

Abstract: Motivated by practical applications where stable long-term performance is
critical-such as robotics, operations research, and healthcare-we study the
problem of distributionally robust (DR) average-reward reinforcement learning.
We propose two algorithms that achieve near-optimal sample complexity. The
first reduces the problem to a DR discounted Markov decision process (MDP),
while the second, Anchored DR Average-Reward MDP, introduces an anchoring state
to stabilize the controlled transition kernels within the uncertainty set.
Assuming the nominal MDP is uniformly ergodic, we prove that both algorithms
attain a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(|\mathbf{S}||\mathbf{A}|
t_{\mathrm{mix}}^2\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ for estimating the optimal policy as
well as the robust average reward under KL and $f_k$-divergence-based
uncertainty sets, provided the uncertainty radius is sufficiently small. Here,
$\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathbf{S}|$ and $|\mathbf{A}|$ denote
the sizes of the state and action spaces, and $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is the mixing
time of the nominal MDP. This represents the first finite-sample convergence
guarantee for DR average-reward reinforcement learning. We further validate the
convergence rates of our algorithms through numerical experiments.
