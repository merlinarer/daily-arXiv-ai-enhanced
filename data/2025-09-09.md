Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于N-Gram频率张量的幻觉检测新方法，通过张量分解提取特征并训练MLP分类器，在HaluEval数据集上表现优于传统基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM幻觉问题，传统指标如ROUGE、BERTScore等缺乏足够的语义深度来有效检测幻觉，需要更丰富的语义结构表示方法

Method: 构建N-Gram频率张量捕获共现模式，应用张量分解提取奇异值作为特征，训练MLP二分类器进行幻觉检测

Result: 在HaluEval数据集上相比传统基线方法有显著提升，与最先进的LLM法官方法相比具有竞争力

Conclusion: N-Gram频率张量方法能够有效捕获文本的语义结构，为幻觉检测提供了新的有效途径

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness across a wide
variety of tasks involving natural language, however, a fundamental problem of
hallucinations still plagues these models, limiting their trustworthiness in
generating consistent, truthful information. Detecting hallucinations has
quickly become an important topic, with various methods such as uncertainty
estimation, LLM Judges, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and consistency
checks showing promise. Many of these methods build upon foundational metrics,
such as ROUGE, BERTScore, or Perplexity, which often lack the semantic depth
necessary to detect hallucinations effectively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach inspired by ROUGE that constructs an N-Gram frequency tensor
from LLM-generated text. This tensor captures richer semantic structure by
encoding co-occurrence patterns, enabling better differentiation between
factual and hallucinated content. We demonstrate this by applying tensor
decomposition methods to extract singular values from each mode and use these
as input features to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier for
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated on the HaluEval dataset and
demonstrates significant improvements over traditional baselines, as well as
competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges.

TL;DR: SAGE是一个触发引导的动态微调框架，能够在推理时实现自适应更新，通过检测推理失败、聚类异常样本和动态优化参数更新来提高LLM的持续学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在推理时无法持续适应和学习新数据的局限性，使模型能够在测试时进行动态知识更新。

Method: 将复杂推理任务分解为原子子任务，包含三个核心模块：触发模块（实时检测推理失败）、触发缓冲模块（使用HDBSCAN进行流式聚类和样本合并）、Lora存储模块（动态优化参数更新和知识保留）。

Result: 在原子推理子任务上表现出优异的准确性、鲁棒性和稳定性，通过测试时的动态知识更新实现了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: SAGE框架有效解决了LLM在推理时的持续学习问题，为实时自适应推理提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models are unable to continuously adapt and learn from new
data during reasoning at inference time. To address this limitation, we propose
that complex reasoning tasks be decomposed into atomic subtasks and introduce
SAGE, a trigger-guided dynamic fine-tuning framework that enables adaptive
updates during reasoning at inference time. SAGE consists of three key
components: (1) a Trigger module that detects reasoning failures through
multiple evaluation metrics in real time; (2) a Trigger Buffer module that
clusters anomaly samples using a streaming clustering process with HDBSCAN,
followed by stability checks and similarity-based merging; and (3) a Lora Store
module that dynamically optimizes parameter updates with an adapter pool for
knowledge retention. Evaluation results show that SAGE demonstrates excellent
accuracy, robustness, and stability on the atomic reasoning subtask through
dynamic knowledge updating during test time.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现多智能体辩论有时会损害而非提升AI推理能力，特别是在异质模型群体中，即使强模型占多数，辩论也可能导致准确率下降，因为模型倾向于达成共识而非挑战错误推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多智能体辩论中模型能力多样性对交互动态和结果的影响，此前研究仅关注同质群体，而本研究关注异质模型群体中的辩论效果。

Method: 通过一系列实验研究多智能体辩论，分析不同能力模型在辩论中的表现，特别关注模型从正确转向错误答案的行为模式。

Result: 辩论可能导致准确率随时间下降，即使强模型数量占优；模型经常在同伴推理影响下从正确答案转向错误答案，偏好达成共识而非挑战错误推理。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论中存在重要失败模式，当智能体既无激励也无足够能力抵抗有说服力但错误的推理时，简单应用辩论可能导致性能下降。

Abstract: While multi-agent debate has been proposed as a promising strategy for
improving AI reasoning ability, we find that debate can sometimes be harmful
rather than helpful. The prior work has exclusively focused on debates within
homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model
capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions.
Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a
decrease in accuracy over time -- even in settings where stronger (i.e., more
capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that
models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer
reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. These results
highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent
debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance
degradation when agents are neither incentivized nor adequately equipped to
resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用合成摘要进行直接评分的方法，用于评估大语言模型作为自动评分器的性能，在样本级相关性方面与最先进的成对评估器表现相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地用于评估自由形式内容（如文档摘要、对话和故事生成），需要评估这些模型与人类判断的相关性。现有的成对比较方法虽然性能良好，但缺乏为单个摘要分配绝对分数的能力，而这种能力对于需要阈值处理的应用场景至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种直接评分方法，使用合成摘要作为测试时的成对机器排名。该方法通过生成合成摘要来模拟人类评估中的成对比较，从而能够为单个样本分配绝对分数。

Result: 在SummEval（+0.03）、TopicalChat（-0.03）和HANNA（+0.05）元评估基准测试中，该方法在轴平均样本级相关性方面与最先进的成对评估器表现相当。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的直接评分解决方案，能够为单个摘要分配绝对分数，同时保持与成对方法相当的评估性能。

Abstract: As large-language models have been increasingly used as automatic raters for
evaluating free-form content, including document summarization, dialog, and
story generation, work has been dedicated to evaluating such models by
measuring their correlations with human judgment. For \textit{sample-level}
performance, methods which operate by using pairwise comparisons between
machine-generated text perform well but often lack the ability to assign
absolute scores to individual summaries, an ability crucial for use cases that
require thresholding. In this work, we propose a direct-scoring method which
uses synthetic summaries to act as pairwise machine rankings at test time. We
show that our method performs comparably to state-of-the-art pairwise
evaluators in terms of axis-averaged sample-level correlations on the SummEval
(\textbf{+0.03}), TopicalChat (\textbf{-0.03}), and HANNA (\textbf{+0.05})
meta-evaluation benchmarks, and release the synthetic in-context summaries as

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究tokenization效率对形态复杂、低资源语言（特别是非洲语言）的不利影响，量化token膨胀对计算资源和准确率的负面影响

Method: 在AfriMMLU数据集（9000个多选题，5个科目，16种非洲语言）上评估10个大语言模型，分析fertility（tokens/word）与准确率的关系，比较推理模型与非推理模型的性能

Result: 1) fertility可靠地预测准确率，更高的fertility始终预测更低的准确率；2) 推理模型（DeepSeek, o1）在所有语言中 consistently outperform 非推理模型；3) token数量翻倍导致训练成本和时间增加四倍

Conclusion: 需要形态感知的tokenization方法、公平定价策略和多语言基准测试，以实现更公平的自然语言处理

Abstract: Tokenization inefficiency imposes structural disadvantages on morphologically
complex, low-resource languages, inflating compute resources and depressing
accuracy. We evaluate 10 large language models (LLMs) on AfriMMLU (9,000 MCQA
items; 5 subjects; 16 African languages) and show that fertility (tokens/word)
reliably predicts accuracy. Higher fertility consistently predicts lower
accuracy across all models and subjects. We further find that reasoning models
(DeepSeek, o1) consistently outperform non-reasoning peers across high and low
resource languages in the AfriMMLU dataset, narrowing accuracy gaps observed in
prior generations. Finally, translating token inflation to economics, a
doubling in tokens results in quadrupled training cost and time, underscoring
the token tax faced by many languages. These results motivate morphologically
aware tokenization, fair pricing, and multilingual benchmarks for equitable
natural language processing (NLP).

TL;DR: 论文提出双向推理作为测试LLM真正理解能力的方法，发现微调会导致认知专业化（前向任务能力提升但双向推理能力下降），并开发了对比微调(CFT)方法来解决这个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI领域的一个基本问题：大型语言模型是真正理解概念还是仅仅识别模式。作者认为真正的理解应该自然允许可逆性，即能够在不经过反向训练的情况下进行双向转换。

Method: 提出双向推理测试框架，开发对比微调(CFT)方法，使用三种示例类型：保持语义的正例、语义不同的负例、前向方向混淆示例。

Result: 实验证明CFT成功实现了双向推理，在保持前向任务能力的同时实现了强大的反向性能。

Conclusion: 双向推理既可作为评估真正理解能力的理论框架，也可作为开发更强大AI系统的实用训练方法。

Abstract: This research addresses a fundamental question in AI: whether large language
models truly understand concepts or simply recognize patterns. The authors
propose bidirectional reasoning,the ability to apply transformations in both
directions without being explicitly trained on the reverse direction, as a test
for genuine understanding. They argue that true comprehension should naturally
allow reversibility. For example, a model that can change a variable name like
userIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index
without reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and
discovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned
on forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability
to reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue,
they developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three
types of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative
examples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples.
This approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level
pattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally
without explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT
successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse
performance while maintaining forward task capabilities. The authors conclude
that bidirectional reasoning serves both as a theoretical framework for
assessing genuine understanding and as a practical training approach for
developing more capable AI systems.

Result: 在分布内和分布外基准推理数据集上都表现出有效性

Conclusion: CoPeD通过改进任务设置和数据利用方式，显著提升了小语言模型的推理质量和泛化性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks but are expensive to
deploy. Thus small language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on CoT data generated
by LLMs to copy LLMs' abilities. However, these CoT data may include noisy
rationales that either fail to substantiate the answers or contribute no
additional information to support answer prediction, which leads SLMs to
capture spurious correlations between questions and answers and compromise the
quality of reasoning. In this work, we propose Chain-of-Thought Correctness
Perception Distillation (CoPeD), which aims to improve the reasoning quality of
the student model from the perspectives of task setting and data utilization.
Firstly, we introduce a correctness-aware task setting that encourages the
student model to predict answers based on correct rationales and revise them
when they are incorrect. This setting improves the faithfulness of reasoning
and allows the model to learn from its mistakes. Then, we propose a
Correctness-Aware Weighted loss, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of
each training instance based on the combined loss of the rationale and the
answer. This strategy encourages the model to focus more on samples where the
rationale offers stronger support for the correct answer. Experiments have
shown that CoPeD is effective on both in-distribution (IND) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: Icon²通过利用LLM表示空间的内在调控，实现了高效且定制化的偏好数据集构建，为LLM对齐提供了新思路

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality preference datasets to
align with human preferences. However, conventional methods for constructing
such datasets face significant challenges: reliance on pre-collected
instructions often leads to distribution mismatches with target models, while
the need for sampling multiple stochastic responses introduces substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we explore a paradigm shift by leveraging
inherent regulation of LLMs' representation space for efficient and tailored
preference dataset construction, named Icon$^{2}$. Specifically, it first
extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode sophisticated human preferences
and then uses these vectors to filter self-synthesized instructions based on
their inherent consistency. During decoding, bidirectional inherent control is
applied to steer token representations, enabling the precise generation of
response pairs with clear alignment distinctions. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment and efficiency.
Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve an average win rate improvement of 13.89% on
AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by
up to 48.1%.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for
solving complex optimization problems, including Neural Architecture Search
(NAS). However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt
engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and
scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel
framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization
without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our
approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural
architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We
also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select
high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning
samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our
curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs,
encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain
(e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA
configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search. The

Motivation: 现有方法重用通常要求问题高度相似，限制了LLM在解决低相似性或具有隐藏相似性问题的应用范围。本文旨在突破这一限制，实现更广泛的方法重用。

Method: 将问题和解决方案分离处理，引导LLM专注于解决方案迁移而非问题识别。针对一般-特定关系的问题，以及仅共享部分特征或隐藏特征的情况，设计相应的重用策略。

Result: 实验验证表明，该范围扩展方法提高了过滤可重用解决方案的概率，从而提升了跨问题方法重用的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了LLM方法重用的适用范围，能够处理传统相似性约束之外的问题，为LLM在实际应用中的方法重用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to assist in finding
solutions for diverse questions. Prior work has proposed representing a method
as a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse.
However, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly
similar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address
questions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not
explicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific
sense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the
question and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The
LLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing
it to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore,
we extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or
hidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond
conventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our
scope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable
solutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.

Abstract: Evaluating factual accuracy in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated clinical
text is a critical barrier to adoption, as expert review is unscalable for the
continuous quality assurance these systems require. We address this challenge
with two complementary contributions. First, we introduce MedFactEval, a
framework for scalable, fact-grounded evaluation where clinicians define
high-salience key facts and an "LLM Jury"--a multi-LLM majority vote--assesses
their inclusion in generated summaries. Second, we present MedAgentBrief, a
model-agnostic, multi-step workflow designed to generate high-quality, factual
discharge summaries. To validate our evaluation framework, we established a
gold-standard reference using a seven-physician majority vote on
clinician-defined key facts from inpatient cases. The MedFactEval LLM Jury
achieved almost perfect agreement with this panel (Cohen's kappa=81%), a
performance statistically non-inferior to that of a single human expert
(kappa=67%, P < 0.001). Our work provides both a robust evaluation framework
(MedFactEval) and a high-performing generation workflow (MedAgentBrief),
offering a comprehensive approach to advance the responsible deployment of
generative AI in clinical workflows.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into diverse workflows, they are
increasingly being considered "collaborators" with humans. If such AI
collaborators are to be reliable, their behavior over multiturn interactions
must be predictable, validated and verified before deployment. Common alignment
techniques are typically developed under simplified single-user settings and do
not account for the dynamics of long-horizon multiparty interactions. This
paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness
as partners in multiturn, multiparty collaborations. We study this question
through the lens of friction agents that intervene in group dialogues to
encourage the collaborative group to slow down and reflect upon their reasoning
for deliberative decision-making. Using a roleplay methodology, we evaluate
interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task
conversations. We propose a novel counterfactual evaluation framework that
quantifies how friction interventions change the trajectory of group
collaboration and belief alignment. Our results show that a friction-aware
approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping both
convergence to a common ground, or agreed-upon task-relevant propositions, and
correctness of task outcomes.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过协同设计自适应算法和模型架构来解决动态计算与系统效率冲突的新方法，包括并行解码机制、深度参数共享和轻量级路由器，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能力强大，但计算成本高昂。自适应计算方法如提前退出虽然能减少计算量，但在批处理推理中会产生系统级瓶颈，反而可能降低吞吐量。需要解决这种动态计算与系统效率之间的根本冲突。

Method: 1) 提出高效的并行解码机制解决传统提前退出的开销问题；2) 采用深度参数共享架构，既实现参数高效又缓解动态推理的同步问题；3) 预训练轻量级路由器动态为每个token分配最优递归深度

Result: 建立了一个新的效率-性能帕累托前沿，在单个模型中同时优化了自适应计算和参数效率，显著提升了推理效率

Conclusion: 通过算法和架构的协同设计，成功解决了动态计算与系统效率的冲突，为高效LLM部署提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their
practical deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. While
adaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs,
they introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save
computation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically
reduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this
conflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike
an optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first
addresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by
proposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep
parameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields
compact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical
synchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents
a unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically
assign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a
new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively
optimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a
single model.

Motivation: 现有真实性基准主要针对英语，缺乏对低资源语言的评估，限制了LLM在多语言环境中的可靠应用。

Method: 将TruthfulQA基准翻译成菲律宾语(KatotohananQA)，使用二元选择框架评估7个免费层专有模型。

Result: 英语和菲律宾语真实性表现存在显著差距；新版OpenAI模型(GPT-5系列)展现良好多语言鲁棒性；不同问题类型、类别和主题的跨语言迁移鲁棒性存在差异。

Conclusion: 需要更广泛的多语言评估以确保LLM使用的公平性和可靠性，某些问题类型在多语言迁移中表现较弱。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various
tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliable adoption.
Benchmarks such as TruthfulQA have been developed to measure truthfulness, yet
they are primarily available in English, leaving a gap in evaluating LLMs in
low-resource languages. To address this, we present KatotohananQA, a Filipino
translation of the TruthfulQA benchmark. Seven free-tier proprietary models
were assessed using a binary-choice framework. Findings show a significant
performance gap between English and Filipino truthfulness, with newer OpenAI
models (GPT-5 and GPT-5 mini) demonstrating strong multilingual robustness.
Results also reveal disparities across question characteristics, suggesting
that some question types, categories, and topics are less robust to
multilingual transfer which highlight the need for broader multilingual

Result: 在标准持续学习基准上达到最先进结果，在大量任务设置中保持顶级性能

Conclusion: 保持参数几何结构与正交性约束相结合是提升LLM多任务持续学习性能的关键

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to catastrophic forgetting in
sequential multi-task settings. Parameter regularization methods such as O-LoRA
and N-LoRA alleviate task interference by enforcing low-rank subspace
orthogonality, but they overlook the fact that conventional additive
fine-tuning disrupts the intrinsic geometric structure of LLM parameters,
limiting performance. Our key insight is that the parameter space of LLMs
possesses a geometric structure, which must be preserved in addition to
enforcing orthogonality. Based on this, we propose Orthogonal Low-rank
Adaptation in Lie Groups (OLieRA), which introduces Lie group theory into LLM
fine-tuning: leveraging multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry
while applying orthogonality constraints to task subspaces. Experiments
demonstrate that OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the Standard CL
benchmark and remains among the top-performing methods in the Large Number of
Tasks setting.

Method: 构建EuroParlVote数据集，包含欧洲议会辩论演讲和投票结果，以及议员的人口统计信息。评估LLM在性别分类和投票预测两个任务上的表现

Result: LLM经常将女性议员错误分类为男性，在模拟女性演讲者投票时准确率降低。在政治上偏向中间派，在极左和极右派上表现较差。GPT-4o等专有模型在鲁棒性和公平性上优于开源模型

Conclusion: LLM在政治敏感语境中存在系统性偏见，需要更多关注公平性和问责制研究

Abstract: We introduce EuroParlVote, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) in politically sensitive contexts. It links European Parliament
debate speeches to roll-call vote outcomes and includes rich demographic
metadata for each Member of the European Parliament (MEP), such as gender, age,
country, and political group. Using EuroParlVote, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLMs on two tasks -- gender classification and vote prediction -- revealing
consistent patterns of bias. We find that LLMs frequently misclassify female
MEPs as male and demonstrate reduced accuracy when simulating votes for female
speakers. Politically, LLMs tend to favor centrist groups while underperforming
on both far-left and far-right ones. Proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform
open-weight alternatives in terms of both robustness and fairness. We release
the EuroParlVote dataset, code, and demo to support future research on fairness

Result: 实验结果表明，后缀中大多数token对攻击成功有显著贡献，修剪少数低影响力token不会影响损失值或攻击成功率，揭示了LLM提示中存在token冗余现象。

Conclusion: Mask-GCG作为一种即插即用方法，能够有效提高越狱攻击效率，减少计算开销，同时为开发高效和可解释的LLM提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various
successful methods whereby attackers manipulate models into generating harmful
responses that they are designed to avoid. Among these, Greedy Coordinate
Gradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes
the tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several
improved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length
suffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains
unexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that
employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix.
Our approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact
positions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only
reduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby
lowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve
successful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the
original GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most
tokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a
minority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the
attack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts.
Our findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs
from the perspective of jailbreak attacks.

Motivation: 传统RAG方法直接将检索文档注入模型上下文，受限于有限的上下文窗口，引入额外计算开销并干扰模型注意力，降低下游任务性能。现有基准缺乏专家标注且仅关注单一任务，无法反映模型在真实法律场景中的能力。

Method: 提出参数化RAG（P-RAG）框架，对语料知识进行数据增强并编码为参数向量，通过LoRA将这些参数化知识集成到LLM的前馈网络中。构建包含2000多个训练和测试实例的专家标注多任务法律数据集。

Conclusion: PL-CA通过参数化知识集成有效缓解了模型上下文压力，为法律领域的知识增强提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional RAG is considered one of the most effective methods for
addressing model knowledge insufficiency and hallucination, particularly in the
judicial domain that requires high levels of knowledge rigor, logical
consistency, and content integrity. However, the conventional RAG method only
injects retrieved documents directly into the model's context, which severely
constrains models due to their limited context windows and introduces
additional computational overhead through excessively long contexts, thereby
disrupting models' attention and degrading performance on downstream tasks.
Moreover, many existing benchmarks lack expert annotation and focus solely on
individual downstream tasks while real-world legal scenarios consist of
multiple mixed legal tasks, indicating conventional benchmarks' inadequacy for
reflecting models' true capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose
PL-CA, which introduces a parametric RAG (P-RAG) framework to perform data
augmentation on corpus knowledge and encode this legal knowledge into
parametric vectors, and then integrates this parametric knowledge into the
LLM's feed-forward networks (FFN) via LoRA, thereby alleviating models' context
pressure. Additionally, we also construct a multi-task legal dataset comprising
more than 2000 training and test instances, which are all expert-annotated and
manually verified. We conduct our experiments on our dataset, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the overhead
associated with excessively long contexts while maintaining competitive
performance on downstream tasks compared to conventional RAG. Our code and
dataset are provided in the appendix.

Conclusion: 该方法为长视野网络代理提供了一条实用路径，模型在仅使用知识密集型QA数据训练的情况下，在HLE基准上也表现出强泛化能力

Abstract: The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly shifted toward
agentic applications, where web browsing capabilities are fundamental for
retrieving information from diverse online sources. However, existing
open-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities
on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify
that the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information
seeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic
data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative,
long-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer
pairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By
leveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced
web agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100
tool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse
information-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art
performance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able
to effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving
higher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best
performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES.
Beyond these information-seeking tasks, our model also achieves strong
generalization on the HLE benchmark even though it is only trained on
knowledge-intensive QA data. These results highlight our approach as a
practical path toward long-horizon web agents.

Conclusion: LAMDAS提供了一种高效准确的数据选择方法，能够显著缓解领域适配中的数据稀缺问题，为LLM的领域专业化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains often faces a
critical bottleneck: the scarcity of high-quality, human-curated data. While
large volumes of unchecked data are readily available, indiscriminately using
them for fine-tuning risks introducing noise and degrading performance.
Strategic data selection is thus crucial, requiring a method that is both
accurate and efficient. Existing approaches, categorized as similarity-based
and direct optimization methods, struggle to simultaneously achieve these
goals. In this paper, we introduce LAMDAS (LLM As an iMplicit classifier for
domain-specific DAta Selection), a novel approach that leverages the
pre-trained LLM itself as an implicit classifier, thereby bypassing explicit
feature engineering and computationally intensive optimization process. LAMDAS
reframes data selection as a one-class classification problem, identifying
candidate data that "belongs" to the target domain defined by a small reference
dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LAMDAS not only
exceeds the performance of full-data training using a fraction of the data but
also outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines under various
scenarios. Furthermore, LAMDAS achieves the most compelling balance between
performance gains and computational efficiency compared to all evaluated
baselines.

Conclusion: HAVE框架透明、可复现，可与现成LLM无缝集成，在真实场景中推进可信生成

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinations in
retrieval-augmented or long-context generation, even when relevant evidence is
present. This stems from two issues: head importance is treated as
input-agnostic, and raw attention weights poorly reflect each token's true
contribution. We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a
parameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE
introduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing
of attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the
magnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together,
these modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and
fuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled
policy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass,
making it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA
benchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces
hallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest
overhead. The framework is transparent, reproducible, and readily integrates
with off-the-shelf LLMs, advancing trustworthy generation in real-world

Conclusion: ProCon方法有效解决了IFT训练中的安全性问题，通过约束r-direction漂移来保持模型拒绝能力。这种基于可解释性机制的探索为未来安全研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective
post-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise
LLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions,
raising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of
LLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,
which plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this
insight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,
which we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To
mitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a
projection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of
each training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis
shows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the
refusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by
overall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our
observation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we
introduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and
broaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an
enhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios,
and LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks
posed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong
baselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance.
Crucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the
r-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration
of LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety
research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong
general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many
in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to
leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without
gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable
continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust
in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning
for broader chat workflows.
  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural
causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a
random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM
to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a
token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and
delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.
  Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8),
MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an
average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across
finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking
many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context
demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly permeate human life, their
security has emerged as a critical concern, particularly their ability to
maintain harmless responses to malicious instructions. Although extensive
methods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative,
rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents
a key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and
security, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we
propose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically
allocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions
of security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial
potential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy
and performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved
MoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and
hidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly
classifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during
router optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong
adaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including
mainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs
optimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for
user interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction
Fine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task
performance gains via a simple data-mix strategy. These comprehensive
improvements highlight MoGU_V2 as a robust and versatile solution for
mitigating security risks in real-world applications.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, logically sound data is a critical bottleneck
for advancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
work confronts this challenge by turning decades of automated theorem proving
research into a scalable data engine. Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs
or complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework
leverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to
derive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is
principled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for "interesting" theorems, and
generate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by
construction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three
difficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection,
and proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a
clear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural
reasoning. Our framework provides both the diagnostic tool to measure this gap
and a scalable source of symbolic training data to address it. We make the code
and data publicly available.

Method: 联合剪枝稀有词汇表（缩小嵌入/解嵌入层）和使用共同token加权的激活值剪枝FFN中间通道，与剪枝后的token分布对齐

Result: 在Qwen、LLaMA和Gemma系列模型（0.5B-70B）上实现了最先进的下游任务性能，参数、GPU内存和端到端延迟显著减少

Conclusion: COMPACT结合了深度和宽度剪枝的优点，具有部署友好性、规模适应性、无需训练等优势，是高效的模型压缩方法

Abstract: Making LLMs more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial
for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at
scale. Pruning is a key technique toward this goal. However, prior pruning
methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout
or requires custom inference code, while depth pruning removes entire layers
and can cause abrupt accuracy drops. In this work, we propose COMPACT, which
jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii)
prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations,
aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys
merits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps
a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN
pruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong
memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and
Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream task performance at
similar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters,
GPU memory, and end-to-end latency.

However, ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge, as
reliability is essential not only for accurate performance but also for

Abstract: Scaling up test-time compute, by generating multiple independent solutions
and selecting or aggregating among them, has become a central paradigm for
improving large language models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. While
most prior work relies on simple majority voting or reward model ranking to
aggregate solutions, these approaches may only yield limited benefits. In this
work, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a
set of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile,
and synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard
training examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover
minority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers.
Empirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and
reward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes
effectively to solutions from differing models, including stronger ones than
contained in the training data, all while requiring substantially fewer tokens
than majority voting with larger numbers of solutions.

Abstract: Encoder-only languages models are frequently used for a variety of standard
machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there
has been a lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect
to multilingual models. We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model
pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build
mmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio
schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700
low-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing
that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the
relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these
low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar

Motivation: 解决LLM作为随机系统可能生成与可用数据不符的数字（数值幻觉）问题，现有安全措施无法保证保真度，需要一种能够强制验证数字准确性的机制

Method: 提出PCN协议，将数字作为声明绑定令牌发出，验证器根据声明的策略（精确相等、舍入、别名或容差）检查每个令牌，验证过程放在渲染器中进行

Result: PCN实现了声音性、诚实令牌下的完备性、故障关闭行为和策略精化下的单调性，是轻量级、模型无关的解决方案，可无缝集成到现有应用中

Conclusion: PCN通过在显示前强制验证，为数值敏感场景建立了简单契约：信任只能通过证明获得，而缺乏标记则传达不确定性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as stochastic systems may generate numbers that
deviate from available data, a failure known as \emph{numeric hallucination}.
Existing safeguards -- retrieval-augmented generation, citations, and
uncertainty estimation -- improve transparency but cannot guarantee fidelity:
fabricated or misquoted values may still be displayed as if correct. We propose
\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that
enforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric
spans are emitted as \emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a
verifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,
rounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places
verification in the \emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers
are marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation
prevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and
prove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and
monotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,
integrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with
cryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before
display, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:
\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates
uncertainty.

Result: 在五个推理基准测试上的实证评估表明，该方法始终优于基线方法，并在效果和效率之间实现了更好的平衡

Conclusion: 通过双层优化实现SFT和RL的协同训练，能够显著提升大语言模型推理训练的效果和效率

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe
efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common
practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this
decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby
constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for
learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate
better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT
objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how
to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs
RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level
explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint
SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and
achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for

training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex

TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models,
namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still

TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over

Abstract: Language use is shaped by pragmatics -- i.e., reasoning about communicative
goals and norms in context. As language models (LMs) are increasingly used as
conversational agents, it becomes ever more important to understand their
pragmatic reasoning abilities. We propose an evaluation framework derived from
Wavelength, a popular communication game where a speaker and a listener
communicate about a broad range of concepts in a granular manner. We study a
range of LMs on both language comprehension and language production using
direct and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and further explore a Rational
Speech Act (RSA) approach to incorporating Bayesian pragmatic reasoning into LM
inference. We find that state-of-the-art LMs, but not smaller ones, achieve
strong performance on language comprehension, obtaining similar-to-human
accuracy and exhibiting high correlations with human judgments even without CoT
prompting or RSA. On language production, CoT can outperform direct prompting,
and using RSA provides significant improvements over both approaches. Our study
helps identify the strengths and limitations in LMs' pragmatic reasoning
abilities and demonstrates the potential for improving them with RSA, opening
up future avenues for understanding conceptual representation, language

synthetic data improves model generalization. Our analysis reveals that

Abstract: Transformer-based language models traditionally use uniform (isotropic) layer

first systematic ablation of LWS and its variants, on a fixed budget of 180M

achieve better performance compared to an equal-cost isotropic baseline,
without a substantial decrease in training throughput. This work represents an

Abstract: Link prediction in knowledge graphs requires integrating structural
information and semantic context to infer missing entities. While large
language models offer strong generative reasoning capabilities, their limited
exploitation of structural signals often results in structural sparsity and
semantic ambiguity, especially under incomplete or zero-shot settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SLiNT (Structure-aware Language model with
Injection and coNtrastive Training), a modular framework that injects
knowledge-graph-derived structural context into a frozen LLM backbone with
lightweight LoRA-based adaptation for robust link prediction. Specifically,
Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) retrieves pseudo-neighbors to
enrich sparse entities and mitigate missing context; Dynamic Hard Contrastive
Learning (DHCL) introduces fine-grained supervision by interpolating hard
positives and negatives to resolve entity-level ambiguity; and
Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) performs token-level structure-aware
intervention while preserving the core LLM parameters. Experiments on WN18RR

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on the retrieval
stage, particularly the coarse-ranking process. Existing coarse-ranking
optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge
learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance.
To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that
uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a
two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of
Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language
capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for
maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage
Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL
training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage
Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline
methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and
scalable retrieval in specialized domains.

Conclusion: 由于没有模型达到完美准确度且校准度差异很大，建议采用人机协同系统，LLM作为强大助手加速和标准化数据标注，提升运维数据质量和下游可靠性分析。

Abstract: Effective Operation and Maintenance (O&M) is critical to reducing the
Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) from wind power, yet the unstructured,
free-text nature of turbine maintenance logs presents a significant barrier to
automated analysis. Our paper addresses this by presenting a novel and
reproducible framework for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on the
task of classifying these complex industrial records. To promote transparency
and encourage further research, this framework has been made publicly available
as an open-source tool. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of
state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing a foundational
assessment of their trade-offs in reliability, operational efficiency, and
model calibration. Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy,
identifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard
and trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that
classification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic
ambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component
identification than on interpretive maintenance actions. Given that no model
achieves perfect accuracy and that calibration varies dramatically, we conclude
that the most effective and responsible near-term application is a
Human-in-the-Loop system, where LLMs act as a powerful assistant to accelerate
and standardise data labelling for human experts, thereby enhancing O&M data
quality and downstream reliability analysis.

Abstract: This paper investigates discrete unit representations in Speech Language
Models (SLMs), focusing on optimizing speech modeling during continual
pre-training. In this paper, we systematically examine how model architecture,
data representation, and training robustness influence the pre-training stage
in which we adapt existing pre-trained language models to the speech modality.
Our experiments highlight the role of speech encoders and clustering
granularity across different model scales, showing how optimal discretization
strategies vary with model capacity. By examining cluster distribution and
phonemic alignments, we investigate the effective use of discrete vocabulary,
uncovering both linguistic and paralinguistic patterns. Additionally, we
explore the impact of clustering data selection on model robustness,
highlighting the importance of domain matching between discretization training
and target applications.

Abstract: Hospital call centers serve as the primary contact point for patients within
a hospital system. They also generate substantial volumes of staff messages as
navigators process patient requests and communicate with the hospital offices
following the established protocol restrictions and guidelines. This
continuously accumulated large amount of text data can be mined and processed
to retrieve insights; however, traditional supervised learning approaches
require annotated data, extensive training, and model tuning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer a paradigm shift toward more computationally efficient
methodologies for healthcare analytics. This paper presents a multi-stage
LLM-based framework that identifies staff message topics and classifies
messages by their reasons in a multi-class fashion. In the process, multiple
LLM types, including reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models, were
evaluated. The best-performing model was o3, achieving 78.4% weighted F1-score
and 79.2% accuracy, followed closely by gpt-5 (75.3% Weighted F1-score and
76.2% accuracy). The proposed methodology incorporates data security measures
and HIPAA compliance requirements essential for healthcare environments. The
processed LLM outputs are integrated into a visualization decision support tool
that transforms the staff messages into actionable insights accessible to
healthcare professionals. This approach enables more efficient utilization of
the collected staff messaging data, identifies navigator training
opportunities, and supports improved patient experience and care quality.

Conclusion: 整合结构信息对于few-shot意图检测至关重要，SAID框架通过统一处理文本和关系信息取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Intent detection is a crucial component of modern conversational systems,
since accurately identifying user intent at the beginning of a conversation is
essential for generating effective responses. Recent efforts have focused on
studying this problem under a challenging few-shot scenario. These approaches
primarily leverage large-scale unlabeled dialogue text corpora to pretrain
language models through various pretext tasks, followed by fine-tuning for
intent detection with very limited annotations. Despite the improvements
achieved, existing methods have predominantly focused on textual data,
neglecting to effectively capture the crucial structural information inherent
in conversational systems, such as the query-query relation and query-answer
relation. To address this gap, we propose SAID, a novel framework that
integrates both textual and relational structure information in a unified
manner for model pretraining for the first time. Building on this framework, we
further propose a novel mechanism, the query-adaptive attention network
(QueryAdapt), which operates at the relation token level by generating
intent-specific relation tokens from well-learned query-query and query-answer
relations explicitly, enabling more fine-grained knowledge transfer. Extensive
experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SAID
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Building upon our previous work on the Multilayer Large Language Model-Based
Robotic Process Automation Applicant Tracking (MLAR) system . This work
introduces a novel methodology. Training fine-tuned LLMs specifically tuned for

set, the resumes were parsed using DeepSeek, a high-parameter LLM. The resumes
were parsed into the same structured JSON format and placed in the training

Abstract: Engagement and motivation are crucial for second-language acquisition, yet
maintaining learner interest in educational conversations remains a challenge.
While prior research has explored what makes educational texts interesting,
still little is known about the linguistic features that drive engagement in
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce IntrEx, the first large
dataset annotated for interestingness and expected interestingness in
teacher-student interactions. Built upon the Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus
(TSCC), IntrEx extends prior work by incorporating sequence-level annotations,
allowing for the study of engagement beyond isolated turns to capture how
interest evolves over extended dialogues. We employ a rigorous annotation
process with over 100 second-language learners, using a comparison-based rating
approach inspired by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
improve agreement. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can
predict human interestingness judgments. We find that LLMs (7B/8B parameters)
fine-tuned on interestingness ratings outperform larger proprietary models like
GPT-4o, demonstrating the potential for specialised datasets to model
engagement in educational settings. Finally, we analyze how linguistic and
cognitive factors, such as concreteness, comprehensibility (readability), and
uptake, influence engagement in educational dialogues.

numerical content, such as numbers, into embeddings. This question is critical
because embedding models are increasingly applied in domains where numbers
matter, such as finance and healthcare. For example, Company X's market share
grew by 2\% should be interpreted very differently from Company X's market
share grew by 20\%, even though both indicate growth in market share. This
study aims to examine whether text embedding models can capture such nuances.
Using synthetic data in a financial context, we evaluate 13 widely used text
embedding models and find that they generally struggle to capture numerical
details accurately. Our further analyses provide deeper insights into embedding
numeracy, informing future research to strengthen embedding model-based NLP
systems with improved capacity for handling numerical content.

Motivation: 现有中医方剂模型缺乏完整的方剂组成和详细解释，现有数据集缺少君臣佐使、功效、禁忌等关键细节，限制了模型输出的深度。

Method: 使用GraphRAG检索和合成结构化中医知识，构建增强的指令数据集进行LLM微调，结合检索增强和微调技术。

Conclusion: GraphRAG与微调技术结合能有效提升中医方剂生成任务的效果，减少幻觉现象。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas play a significant role in
treating epidemics and complex diseases. Existing models for TCM utilize
traditional algorithms or deep learning techniques to analyze formula
relationships, yet lack comprehensive results, such as complete formula
compositions and detailed explanations. Although recent efforts have used TCM
instruction datasets to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable
formula generation, existing datasets lack sufficient details, such as the
roles of the formula's sovereign, minister, assistant, courier; efficacy;
contraindications; tongue and pulse diagnosis-limiting the depth of model
outputs. To address these challenges, we propose ZhiFangDanTai, a framework
combining Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) with LLM
fine-tuning. ZhiFangDanTai uses GraphRAG to retrieve and synthesize structured
TCM knowledge into concise summaries, while also constructing an enhanced
instruction dataset to improve LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved
information. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical proofs demonstrating
that integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques can reduce generalization
error and hallucination rates in the TCM formula task. Experimental results on
both collected and clinical datasets demonstrate that ZhiFangDanTai achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. Our model is

Conclusion: 该框架为3D医学影像中的提示驱动疾病进展分析奠定了基础，是首个专门应用于神经影像数据的语言引导原生3D扩散模型演示。

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating 2D images under various conditions; however the impressive
performance of these models in 2D is largely enabled by extensive, readily
available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained
foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this
domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce
high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural
language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would
enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized
counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and
enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in
realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this
challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D
counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form
language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with
enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to
improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the
first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied
specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional
modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure.
Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework
successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating
high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically
generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven
disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging.

Result: 发现强烈泛化证据：伙伴间对齐度显著提高；泛化随视觉相似性非线性衰减；在不同可命名性水平下都稳健

Conclusion: 临时约定不是任意标签而是真正的概念协调，这对指称理论和自适应语言代理设计有重要启示

Abstract: How do people talk about things they've never talked about before? One view
suggests that a new shared naming system establishes an arbitrary link to a
specific target, like proper names that cannot extend beyond their bearers. An
alternative view proposes that forming a shared way of describing objects
involves broader conceptual alignment, reshaping each individual's semantic
space in ways that should generalize to new referents. We test these competing
accounts in a dyadic communication study (N=302) leveraging the
recently-released KiloGram dataset containing over 1,000 abstract tangram
images. After pairs of participants coordinated on referential conventions for
one set of images through repeated communication, we measured the extent to
which their descriptions aligned for undiscussed images. We found strong
evidence for generalization: partners showed increased alignment relative to
their pre-test labels. Generalization also decayed nonlinearly with visual
similarity (consistent with Shepard's law) and was robust across levels of the
images' nameability. These findings suggest that ad hoc conventions are not
arbitrary labels but reflect genuine conceptual coordination, with implications
for theories of reference and the design of more adaptive language agents.

Conclusion: 将对齐问题视为检测问题并使用不平衡最优传输方法，能够更好地处理声学-语言学模态间的复杂对齐关系，为ASR知识迁移提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning acoustic and linguistic representations is a central challenge to
bridge the pre-trained models in knowledge transfer for automatic speech
recognition (ASR). This alignment is inherently structured and asymmetric:
while multiple consecutive acoustic frames typically correspond to a single
linguistic token (many-to-one), certain acoustic transition regions may relate
to multiple adjacent tokens (one-to-many). Moreover, acoustic sequences often
include frames with no linguistic counterpart, such as background noise or
silence may lead to imbalanced matching conditions. In this work, we take a new
insight to regard alignment and matching as a detection problem, where the goal
is to identify meaningful correspondences with high precision and recall
ensuring full coverage of linguistic tokens while flexibly handling redundant
or noisy acoustic frames in transferring linguistic knowledge for ASR. Based on
this new insight, we propose an unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment
model that explicitly handles distributional mismatch and structural
asymmetries with soft and partial matching between acoustic and linguistic
modalities. Our method ensures that every linguistic token is grounded in at
least one acoustic observation, while allowing for flexible, probabilistic
mappings from acoustic to linguistic units. We evaluate our proposed model with
experiments on an CTC-based ASR system with a pre-trained language model for
knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in flexibly controlling degree of matching and hence to improve ASR
performance.

Motivation: 波斯语拥有超过1.27亿使用者，通常被认为是中等资源语言，但作者发现这种标签在深入考察主观NLP任务时并不准确，需要系统评估数据可用性和质量。

Method: 回顾了110篇关于波斯语主观任务的出版物，分析了公开数据集的可用性、数据质量（特别是人口统计信息的缺失），并使用有限可用数据集评估预测模型的稳定性。

Result: 发现波斯语主观任务领域存在严重的公开数据集稀缺问题，现有数据集缺乏年龄、性别等关键人口统计信息。模型评估结果显示结果在数据集和模型间高度不稳定。

Conclusion: 单纯的数据量增加不足以显著改善语言在NLP中的前景，数据质量和关键信息的完整性同样重要。波斯语在主观NLP任务中实际上更接近低资源语言。

Abstract: Given Farsi's speaker base of over 127 million people and the growing
availability of digital text, including more than 1.3 million articles on
Wikipedia, it is considered a middle-resource language. However, this label
quickly crumbles when the situation is examined more closely. We focus on three
subjective tasks (Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Analysis, and Toxicity Detection)
and find significant challenges in data availability and quality, despite the
overall increase in data availability. We review 110 publications on subjective
tasks in Farsi and observe a lack of publicly available datasets. Furthermore,
existing datasets often lack essential demographic factors, such as age and
gender, that are crucial for accurately modeling subjectivity in language. When
evaluating prediction models using the few available datasets, the results are
highly unstable across both datasets and models. Our findings indicate that the
volume of data is insufficient to significantly improve a language's prospects
in NLP.

Abstract: Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
encoding and understanding the complexity of natural languages through the
power of quantum computation. This paper presents a pretrained quantum
context-sensitive embedding model, called QCSE, that captures context-sensitive
word embeddings, leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems to learn
contextual relationships in languages. The model introduces quantum-native
context learning, enabling the utilization of quantum computers for linguistic
tasks. Central to the proposed approach are innovative context matrix
computation methods, designed to create unique, representations of words based
on their surrounding linguistic context. Five distinct methods are proposed and
tested for computing the context matrices, incorporating techniques such as
exponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, and hash-based
transformations. These methods ensure that the quantum embeddings retain
context sensitivity, thereby making them suitable for downstream language tasks
where the expressibility and properties of quantum systems are valuable
resources. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model and the associated
context matrix methods, evaluations are conducted on both a Fulani corpus, a
low-resource African language, dataset of small size and an English corpus of
slightly larger size. The results demonstrate that QCSE not only captures
context sensitivity but also leverages the expressibility of quantum systems
for representing rich, context-aware language information. The use of Fulani
further highlights the potential of QNLP to mitigate the problem of lack of
data for this category of languages. This work underscores the power of quantum
computation in natural language processing (NLP) and opens new avenues for
applying QNLP to real-world linguistic challenges across various tasks and
domains.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多粒度语义相关性建模有效解决了偏置信息量变化对上下文ASR性能的影响，显著提升了识别准确率

Abstract: Recently, cross-attention-based contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR)
models have made notable advancements in recognizing personalized biasing
phrases. However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by
variations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the
biasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of
the biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant
to a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and
integrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire
biasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information
volume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic
correlation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and
calculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate
representations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,
phrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled
to produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information
across various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual
recognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the
joint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification
mechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant
biasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves
average relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46%
on KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths.

that direct subjectivity identification significantly improves the model
performance of flagging subjective arguments. Furthermore, combining
contrastive loss with binary cross-entropy loss does not improve performance
but reduces the dependency on per-label subjectivity. Our proposed methods can
help identify arguments that individuals may interpret differently, fostering a

WhisperX and Wav2Vec 2.0 to extract automated audio-text alignment. Our
processing pipeline improves upon the ParCzech 3.0 speech recognition version
by extracting more data with higher alignment reliability. The dataset is
offered in three flexible variants: (1) sentence-segmented for automatic speech

preserving original utterance flow across sentences, and (3) a raw-alignment
for further custom refinement for other possible tasks. All variants maintain
the original metadata and are released under a permissive CC-BY license. The

Method: 构建两种多模态细粒度对话交互图：语义交互图和韵律交互图，编码词级别语义、韵律及其对后续话语影响的交互特征，用于增强合成语音的自然对话韵律。

Result: 在DailyTalk数据集上的实验表明，MFCIG-CSS在韵律表达性方面优于所有基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过细粒度的多模态上下文交互建模可以有效提升对话语音合成的韵律质量，词级别的语义和韵律交互特征对生成自然对话语音至关重要。

Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to generate speech with natural
prosody by understanding the multimodal dialogue history (MDH). The latest work
predicts the accurate prosody expression of the target utterance by modeling
the utterance-level interaction characteristics of MDH and the target
utterance. However, MDH contains fine-grained semantic and prosody knowledge at
the word level. Existing methods overlook the fine-grained semantic and
prosodic interaction modeling. To address this gap, we propose MFCIG-CSS, a
novel Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph-based CSS system. Our
approach constructs two specialized multimodal fine-grained dialogue
interaction graphs: a semantic interaction graph and a prosody interaction
graph. These two interaction graphs effectively encode interactions between
word-level semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances in
MDH. The encoded interaction features are then leveraged to enhance synthesized
speech with natural conversational prosody. Experiments on the DailyTalk
dataset demonstrate that MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in terms of
prosodic expressiveness. Code and speech samples are available at

Motivation: 当前大语言模型和视觉语言模型在单轮任务表现出色，但在需要深度上下文理解和复杂视觉推理的多轮交互中存在推理碎片化、上下文丢失和幻觉问题

Method: 提出CAMVR框架，包含视觉-文本上下文记忆单元(VCMU)动态存储管理多模态信息，以及自适应视觉聚焦指导(AVFG)机制动态调整视觉注意力，采用多层次推理整合策略

Result: 在VisDial、A-OKVQA和MTIF等数据集上实现最先进性能

Conclusion: CAMVR有效解决了多轮视觉语言交互中的上下文管理和推理连贯性问题，为复杂多模态对话系统提供了有力解决方案

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Result: CARVE一致提升性能，在开源模型上实现高达75%的改进，无需额外训练

Conclusion: 揭示了视觉复杂度与注意力机制的相互作用，为通过对比注意力改善视觉推理提供了高效途径

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video

action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability

hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently

SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight

TL;DR: 提出基于纯文本的Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation (LSGA)方法，使用大语言模型分两阶段预测场景图中的物体出现/消失和详细关系，在场景图预测任务中取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景图预测方法主要依赖视觉线索，难以有效整合常识知识，限制了长期预测的鲁棒性。需要显式利用常识知识来更好地理解场景图中的物体、概念和关系

Method: 提出Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method (OOTSM)：1) 使用LLM首先预测物体的出现和消失；2) 生成详细的人-物关系。基于纯文本进行场景图预测，与视觉模型解耦

Result: 在Action Genome基准测试中，短期mean-Recall(@10)提升3.4%，长期mean-Recall(@50)大幅提升21.9%。微调的开源LLM在LSGA任务上表现优于GPT-4o等零样本API

Conclusion: 纯文本的LSGA方法能有效利用常识知识，显著提升场景图预测性能，特别是在长期预测方面。该方法具有独立研究价值，超越了在SGA中的应用

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

Motivation: 当前视频对象分割方法在处理复杂组合描述时存在困难，主要挑战在于静态文本与动态视觉内容的对齐，特别是当相似外观对象具有不一致运动和姿态时。

Method: 1) 将自然语言查询解析为结构化语义命令；2) 时空定位模块生成所有候选轨迹；3) 分层识别模块通过两阶段推理（粗粒度运动推理和细粒度姿态验证）选择正确目标。

Result: 在Ref-YouTube-VOS、Ref-DAVIS17和MeViS三个主要基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS框架通过LLM驱动的分层推理有效解决了复杂语言描述下的视频对象分割问题，证明了训练免费方法的有效性。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

Conclusion: BTCChat通过专门设计的架构有效解决了双时相图像分析中的时空建模问题，显著提升了变化理解能力

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

Motivation: 传统图像压缩方法注重像素级重建，但新兴应用更关注语义保存和跨数据分布、下游任务的鲁棒性能，需要先进的语义压缩范式

Method: 利用多模态基础模型CLIP的零样本和表征能力，将CLIP特征嵌入压缩为最小比特，同时保持不同任务间的语义信息

Result: 在基准数据集上保持语义完整性，平均比特率约0.002-0.003 bpp，比主流图像压缩方法节省95%以上比特率，在极端压缩下仍展现跨数据分布和下游任务的零样本鲁棒性

Conclusion: 基于CLIP的语义压缩方法在极低比特率下有效保持语义信息，为图像压缩提供了新的语义导向范式

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

Conclusion: MedSeqFT建立了序列微调作为适应基础模型到演进临床任务的有效、知识保持范式

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Conclusion: PAML通过系统性地解决跨模态对齐、特征融合和原型利用问题，显著提升了开放词汇视觉定位的性能。

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.

minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official

Abstract: Grounding object affordance is fundamental to robotic manipulation as it
establishes the critical link between perception and action among interacting
objects. However, prior works predominantly focus on predicting single-object
affordance, overlooking the fact that most real-world interactions involve
relationships between pairs of objects. In this work, we address the challenge
of object-to-object affordance grounding under limited data contraints.
Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning with 2D vision foundation
models, we propose a novel one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learning
approach for robotic manipulation. Semantic features from vision foundation
models combined with point cloud representation for geometric understanding
enable our one-shot learning pipeline to generalize effectively to novel
objects and categories. We further integrate our 3D affordance representation
with large language models (LLMs) for robotics manipulation, significantly
enhancing LLMs' capability to comprehend and reason about object interactions
when generating task-specific constraint functions. Our experiments on 3D
object-to-object affordance grounding and robotic manipulation demonstrate that
our O$^3$Afford significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of both

Abstract: Vision foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable potential in
medical imaging despite their origin in natural image domains. However, their
design inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their
effectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical
fields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in
this setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with
missing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these
gaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the
pre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our
approach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation
models to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing
modalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to
learn robust cross-modality relationships. Furthermore, we leverage
semi-supervised learning to harness large unlabeled datasets, enhancing both
the accuracy and reliability of medical predictions. Applied to glioma subtype
classification from multi-sequence brain MRI, our method achieves a Matthews
Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.6 on an external test set, surpassing
state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%. Our work establishes a
scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging tasks, leveraging

Abstract: The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has
inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic
manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from
autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in
text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a
series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for
robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present
LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon
pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to
robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token
classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with
special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a
hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences
hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.

TL;DR: F1是一个预训练的视觉-语言-动作(VLA)框架，通过集成视觉前瞻生成到决策流程中，解决了动态视觉环境中语言条件任务的执行问题。

Motivation: 现有的VLA模型主要采用反应式的状态到动作映射，在动态场景中容易导致短视行为和鲁棒性差的问题。

Method: 采用混合Transformer架构，包含感知、前瞻生成和控制模块。核心是下一尺度预测机制，合成目标条件的视觉前瞻作为显式规划目标，将动作生成重新表述为前瞻引导的逆动力学问题。

Conclusion: F1框架通过视觉前瞻生成改进了VLA模型的决策能力，在动态环境中表现出更好的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a
central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to
short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,
we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual
foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a
Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,
foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,
and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to
synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By
forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation
as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that
implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable
capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset
comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training
scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual
foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive
evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1
consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in
both task success rate and generalization ability.

TL;DR: 提出Label Smoothing++方法，通过为非目标类别分配非零概率并考虑类别间关系，改进传统标签平滑技术，缓解过拟合和过度自信预测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标签平滑虽然能提高泛化能力，但为所有非目标类别分配相同权重，破坏了类别间的关系结构。需要一种能保持类别间关系的正则化方法。

Method: Label Smoothing++方法：为目标类别使用固定标签，同时让网络学习非目标类别的标签分布，考虑类别间的语义关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效缓解过度自信预测，同时促进类别间关系学习和泛化能力提升。

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++通过建模类别间关系，在保持正则化效果的同时改进了传统标签平滑方法的局限性。

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

Method: 构建合成数据集生成管道产生带4个线索标注的图像，对Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct进行参数高效监督微调，采用两阶段重思考推理机制

Result: 在隔离单个域偏移的鲁棒性基准测试中，RT-VLM持续超越强基线模型

Conclusion: 结构化多模态证据与显式自批判循环的结合是实现可靠和可迁移视觉理解的有前景途径

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly

Motivation: 现有的视频场景图生成方法通常针对特定粒度（边界框级别或像素级别）设计，需要任务特定的架构和多阶段训练流程。本文旨在开发一个统一的端到端框架，最小化任务特定修改，最大化参数共享，实现不同视觉粒度级别的泛化。

Method: 提出UNO框架：1）扩展槽注意机制将视觉特征分解为对象槽和关系槽；2）对象时间一致性学习确保跨帧的对象表示一致性；3）动态三元组预测模块将关系槽链接到对应的对象对，捕捉随时间演化的交互。

Result: 在标准边界框级别和像素级别VidSGG基准测试中，UNO在两个任务上都取得了有竞争力的性能，同时通过统一的以对象为中心的设计提高了效率。

Conclusion: UNO证明了统一的单阶段框架可以有效地处理不同粒度的视频场景图生成任务，为多粒度视觉内容分析提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Conclusion: RARL方法有效解决了增量开放集识别中的表示漂移和决策边界退化问题，为动态环境下的开放集识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Conclusion: VQA系统需要适应真实人类的不确定性，为盲人和低视力用户提供包容性支持。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

Conclusion: DVRF成功弥合了基于分数的扩散优化和基于速度的整流流优化，为FlowEdit等方法提供了理论解释，是文本到图像编辑的有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

Conclusion: 将视频摘要建模为语言引导的时空图问题能够有效捕捉细粒度语义关系，递归图网络策略在视频摘要任务中表现出色

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training

integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available

Main category: cs.CV

Relevance: 35.0

TL;DR: Probabilistic SAM是SAM的概率扩展版本，通过引入潜在变量空间和变分训练目标，能够生成反映人类标注变异性的多样化分割掩码，特别适用于医学图像中存在的标注不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可提示分割模型（如SAM）是确定性的，无法捕捉真实世界任务中固有的模糊性，特别是在医学成像中由于标注不确定性或专家间变异性导致的多重合理分割需求。

Method: 在SAM框架中集成先验和后验网络，通过潜在代码在推理过程中调制提示嵌入，使用变分目标训练模型学习分割分布。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI肺结节数据集上评估显示，Probabilistic SAM能够产生与专家分歧一致的多样化输出，在不确定性感知指标上优于现有概率基线方法。

Conclusion: Probabilistic SAM成功扩展了SAM的概率能力，为处理医学图像分割中的不确定性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

TL;DR: ConstStyle提出了一种新的领域泛化方法，通过将训练和测试数据映射到统一的领域来捕获领域不变特征，有效减少领域偏移的影响，在有限训练领域和大领域差距情况下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在测试数据分布与训练数据不同时性能下降，现有领域泛化方法在训练领域有限或训练-测试领域差距大时效果不佳。需要让模型在接近未见测试域的领域上训练，但由于缺乏未见域的先验知识而困难。

Method: 提出ConstStyle方法：1）构建统一领域捕获领域不变特征；2）训练时将样本映射到该统一领域进行优化；3）测试时类似投影未见域样本；4）通过理论分析桥接领域差距。

Result: 广泛实验表明ConstStyle在各种场景下一致优于现有方法。当只有有限训练领域时，相比次优方法准确率提升高达19.82%。

Conclusion: ConstStyle通过统一领域对齐有效减少领域偏移影响，即使在领域差距大或训练领域少的情况下也能显著提升领域泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

Conclusion: 整合运动信息的方法在航天器姿态估计任务中有效，能够提升性能并增强泛化能力

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了医学图像生物识别隐私问题，在保护隐私的同时保持了医疗诊断价值。

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench和Ego3D-VLM为推进真实世界多视角环境中的类人空间理解提供了有价值的工具

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we

reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with

Conclusion: Phantom-Insight通过结合SAM和MLLM的优势，并引入创新的解耦学习策略，有效解决了视频伪装目标检测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: TIDE框架有效解决了SDIG任务的核心挑战，为文本到图像扩散模型提供了新的训练范式。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

Abstract: Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D
understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications
such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor
robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the
process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part

feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling
interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly

Conclusion: 提出的混合架构结合对比学习在视频年龄分类任务上表现优异，已部署为实时MPAA评级分类的Web应用，为流媒体平台提供自动化内容合规解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating
classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance
across streaming platforms.

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and

Conclusion: 该轻量级架构为实时医学图像分割提供了实用替代方案，平衡了精度和效率

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models

million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,

wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at

Conclusion: 维持完整姿态序列是不必要的，少量代表性帧的姿态token即可实现高效准确的估计

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are

Abstract: Large transformer-based models have made significant progress in
generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, generating
novel viewpoints without the need for test-time optimization. However, these
models are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene
datasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To
overcome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion
models, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic
data offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data
generation as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address
this, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer
architecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective
learning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over
standard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data.
As a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and
cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs. Project page:

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机虽然能提供高时间分辨率的运动信息，但其固有的阈值机制导致事件流不完整，限制了运动先验的完整性和事件引导去模糊的效果

Method: 1. 鲁棒性导向扰动策略(RPS)：对事件进行随机掩码，增强对不完整模式的鲁棒性；2. 解耦全注意力机制：显式建模运动内、运动间和跨模态相关性；3. 两个交互模块：增强模糊图像中的运动敏感区域，并向不完整事件表示注入语义上下文

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，RED在准确性和鲁棒性方面均达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了事件流不完整性问题，为事件引导的运动去模糊提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

Motivation: 当前AIGC技术快速发展使得人脸伪造越来越逼真，对社会安全构成威胁。但现有Deepfake检测方法受限于数据集缺乏真实世界场景的多样性，特别是在未知伪造技术、面部场景变化、真实数据丰富度和现实传播退化等方面存在不足。

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform

Motivation: 传统单图像超分辨率方法假设空间不变的退化模型，但真实成像系统存在距离依赖效应（大气散射、景深变化等），需要空间自适应重建策略来结合几何场景理解。

Method: 提出变分框架将超分辨率建模为空间变化逆问题，使用伪微分算子描述距离依赖的光谱特性。神经网络架构通过深度条件卷积核实现离散梯度流动力学，结合学习到的距离自适应正则化项。

Conclusion: 建立了首个理论基础的深度自适应超分辨率框架，在深度变化场景中显著提升性能，同时在传统基准上保持竞争力。

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these

yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised

defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative

destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的细粒度动态感知（FDP）框架用于面部微表情识别，通过排序帧级特征来编码动态信息，结合局部-全局特征感知Transformer和动态图像构建任务，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Motivation: 面部微表情识别面临瞬态性、细微性和动态性的挑战，现有方法要么需要手工特征和关键帧，要么受限于小规模和低多样性的训练数据。

Method: 提出FDP框架：1）使用局部-全局特征感知Transformer进行帧表示学习；2）通过排序器计算帧级特征的排序分数；3）时间维度池化捕获动态表示；4）联合微表情分类和动态图像构建任务。

Result: 在CASME II、SAMM、CAS(ME)^2和CAS(ME)^3数据集上，F1分数分别比之前最佳结果提高了4.05%、2.50%、7.71%和2.11%。

Conclusion: FDP框架通过动态特征排序和联合学习策略，有效解决了微表情识别的挑战，在性能和动态图像构建方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time

Conclusion: 通过整合细节保留下采样、边缘敏感表示、双域注意力和难度自适应回归，为基于无人机的小缺陷检测提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D有效解决了多光谱到高光谱图像生成中的空间-光谱权衡问题，在重建质量和下游应用中都表现出色。

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

Conclusion: 球坐标量化方案能够有效处理3DGS在3DoF+场景下的坐标量化问题，减小投影误差，提高重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

Conclusion: 强调了训练设计在跨模态检索任务中的关键作用，以及需要改进场景级SBIR评估场景的必要性。

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models, which are capable of generating full object
shapes from just a few images, now open up new opportunities in robotics. In
this work, we show that 3D generative models can be used to augment a dataset
from a single real-world demonstration, after which an omnidirectional policy
can be learned within this imagined dataset. We found that this enables a robot
to perform a task when initialised from states very far from those observed
during the demonstration, including starting from the opposite side of the
object relative to the real-world demonstration, significantly reducing the
number of demonstrations required for policy learning. Through several
real-world experiments across tasks such as grasping objects, opening a drawer,
and placing trash into a bin, we study these omnidirectional policies by
investigating the effect of various design choices on policy behaviour, and we
show superior performance to recent baselines which use alternative methods for
data augmentation.

Abstract: Mars exploration requires precise and reliable terrain models to ensure safe
rover navigation across its unpredictable and often hazardous landscapes.
Stereoscopic vision serves a critical role in the rover's perception, allowing
scene reconstruction by generating precise depth maps through stereo matching.
State-of-the-art Martian planetary exploration uses traditional local
block-matching, aggregates cost over square windows, and refines disparities
via smoothness constraints. However, this method often struggles with
low-texture images, occlusion, and repetitive patterns because it considers
only limited neighbouring pixels and lacks a wider understanding of scene
context. This paper uses Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with superpixel-based
refinement to mitigate the inherent block artefacts and recover lost details.
The approach balances the efficiency and accuracy of SGM and adds context-aware
segmentation to support more coherent depth inference. The proposed method has
been evaluated in three datasets with successful results: In a Mars analogue,
the terrain maps obtained show improved structural consistency, particularly in
sloped or occlusion-prone regions. Large gaps behind rocks, which are common in
raw disparity outputs, are reduced, and surface details like small rocks and
edges are captured more accurately. Another two datasets, evaluated to test the
method's general robustness and adaptability, show more precise disparity maps
and more consistent terrain models, better suited for the demands of autonomous
navigation on Mars, and competitive accuracy across both non-occluded and
full-image error metrics. This paper outlines the entire terrain modelling
process, from finding corresponding features to generating the final 2D
navigation maps, offering a complete pipeline suitable for integration in
future planetary exploration missions.

We compared FL with centralized (CL) and local learning (LL) for tooth

scenarios. Methods: An Attention U-Net was trained on 2066 radiographs from six
institutions across four settings: baseline (unaltered data); label

(additive Gaussian noise); and exclusion of a faulty client with corrupted
data. FL was implemented via the Flower AI framework. Per-client training- and

From these metrics significance results were reported through Wilcoxon

TL;DR: 该研究系统分析了YOLOv8和YOLOv10在不同层冻结配置下的性能表现，发现最优冻结策略取决于数据集特性，可减少28% GPU内存使用并有时超越全微调精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源受限环境（如无人机）中部署YOLO架构时，不同冻结配置对当代YOLOv8和YOLOv10架构影响不明确的问题，特别是在冻结深度、数据集特性和训练动态之间的相互作用方面

Method: 使用四个关键基础设施监控数据集，系统研究YOLOv8和YOLOv10变体的多种冻结配置，结合梯度行为分析（L2范数）和可视化解释（Grad-CAM）来深入理解不同冻结策略下的训练动态

Result: 结果显示不存在通用的最优冻结策略，而是取决于数据特性：冻结主干网络有效保留通用特征，浅层冻结更适合处理极端类别不平衡。这些配置相比全微调减少28% GPU内存消耗，在某些情况下mAP@50甚至超过全微调

Conclusion: 研究提供了选择冻结策略的经验发现和实践指南，为资源受限场景中的目标检测提供了实用、基于证据的平衡迁移学习方法

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique

Conclusion: 该框架成功克服了PointPillars的局限性，实现了基于伪图像表示的高效两阶段3D检测，为实时3D感知提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

Motivation: 脑肿瘤MRI分割是医学图像分析的关键挑战，准确的肿瘤边界划分对临床决策、放疗规划和疾病监测至关重要。研究旨在比较硬聚类和软聚类两种主要分割范式的性能差异。

Method: 使用BraTS2020数据集，采用高斯滤波和CLAHE进行预处理，比较K-Means（硬聚类）和Fuzzy C-Means（软聚类）算法，评估指标包括Dice相似系数和处理时间。

Result: K-Means平均运行时间0.3秒/图像，FCM为1.3秒/图像；FCM分割精度更高，平均DSC为0.67，而K-Means为0.43。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了计算效率与分割精度之间的权衡关系，K-Means在速度上优势明显，而FCM在边界精度方面表现更佳。

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Method: 提出MeshMetrics框架，采用基于网格的方法而非传统的基于网格的方法来计算距离度量指标，通过理论分析和实证验证来确保更高的准确性和精度。

Result: MeshMetrics在Hausdorff距离和归一化表面距离等指标上比现有工具更准确，受离散化伪影（如距离量化）的影响显著减小。

Conclusion: MeshMetrics提供了一个更可靠的距离度量计算框架，有助于提高医学图像分割研究的可重复性和准确性。

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T保持了即插即用的模态融合能力，同时显著增强了时间稳定性，提升了SLAM的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along

These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this

These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine

in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat

Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

Motivation: 低剂量CT和PET成像虽然减少了辐射暴露，但会导致噪声和伪影增加，影响诊断准确性。需要开发有效的去噪方法来提升图像质量同时保持辐射安全。

Method: 提出混合Swin注意力网络(HSANet)，包含高效全局注意力(EGA)模块增强空间和通道交互，以及混合上采样模块防止过拟合噪声。

Result: 在公开LDCT/PET数据集上的实验表明，HSANet相比现有方法具有更优越的去噪性能，同时保持轻量级模型大小，适合标准内存GPU部署。

Conclusion: HSANet为低剂量医学影像去噪提供了一种高效实用的解决方案，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

Motivation: 随着长航时海底自主水下航行器（AUV）能力增强，需要实时解释海底图像以支持自适应任务和优化通信效率。传统离线方法依赖完整数据集和人工标注，无法满足实时需求。

Method: 在线聚类框架（OCF），通过识别和维持一组代表性样本来捕获演化特征分布，支持动态聚类合并和分割，在恒定时间内高效回顾和整合整个数据历史中的常见模式。

Result: 在三个不同海底图像数据集上评估，OCF在所有比较的在线聚类方法中获得了最高的平均F1分数0.68，标准差为3%，计算时间随数据量增加保持较低且有界。

Conclusion: OCF具有优越的聚类能力和对轨迹变化的鲁棒性，有利于生成调查数据摘要和支持长期持久自主海洋探测中的信息路径规划。

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited

particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we

access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors

  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable

design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in
real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1)
CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to
the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2)
learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object
categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset
mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.

extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to

existing algorithms under both controlled and adverse conditions, paving the

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

Abstract: The bioinspired event camera, distinguished by its exceptional temporal
resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, has been extensively
studied in recent years for motion estimation, robotic perception, and object
detection. In ego-motion estimation, the visual-inertial setup is commonly
adopted due to complementary characteristics between sensors (e.g., scale
perception and low drift). For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion,
accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In
this work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator
for event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid
board. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in
eKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and
efficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be
accurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization
is conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The
results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can
achieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The
implementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an invaluable tool for clinical and
research applications. Yet, variations in scanners and acquisition parameters
cause inconsistencies in image contrast, hindering data comparability and
reproducibility across datasets and clinical studies. Existing scanner
harmonization methods, designed to address this challenge, face limitations,
such as requiring traveling subjects or struggling to generalize to unseen
domains. We propose a novel approach using a conditioned diffusion autoencoder
with a contrastive loss and domain-agnostic contrast augmentation to harmonize
MR images across scanners while preserving subject-specific anatomy. Our method
enables brain MRI synthesis from a single reference image. It outperforms
baseline techniques, achieving a +7% PSNR improvement on a traveling subjects
dataset and +18% improvement on age regression in unseen. Our model provides
robust, effective harmonization of brain MRIs to target scanners without
requiring fine-tuning. This advancement promises to enhance comparability,
reproducibility, and generalizability in multi-site and longitudinal clinical
studies, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.

Motivation: 现有的人体模型（如SMPL）具有简化的运动学结构，与真实人体骨骼系统的关节位置和关节结构不符，限制了其在生物力学中的应用。而传统的生物力学准确骨骼运动估计方法通常依赖于复杂的运动捕捉系统和昂贵的优化方法。

Abstract: Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from
images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters
of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have
simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint
locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their
potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating
biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion
capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a
parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure
that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL
body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data
of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.
  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons
inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL
mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we
re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting
SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and
biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more
biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside
the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes
we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include
biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in
the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better
constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code,

ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

Motivation: 在医学成像中，点分布模型常用于重建和完成部分形状，但训练数据和目标形状之间的姿态对齐差异会导致有偏的解决方案，特别是在观察小部分形状时。

Method: 提出一种高效的方法来调整现有模型以适应特定目标姿态，保持线性模型的计算效率，无需访问原始训练数据，通过简单的预处理步骤实现。

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements
in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark
algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions,
showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

Abstract: Directed energy deposition (DED), a metal additive manufacturing process, is
highly susceptible to process-induced defects such as geometric deviations,
lack of fusion, and poor surface finish. This work presents a
build-height-synchronized fringe projection system for in-situ, layer-wise
surface reconstruction of laser-DED components, achieving a reconstruction
accuracy of ${\pm}$46 ${\mu}$m. From the reconstructed 3D morphology, two
complementary geometry-based point cloud metrics are introduced: local point
density, which highlights poor surface finish, and normal-change rate, which
identifies lack-of-fusion features. These methods enable automated,
annotation-free identification of common deposition anomalies directly from
reconstructed surfaces, without the need for manual labeling. By directly
linking geometric deviation to defect formation, the approach enables precise
anomaly localization and advances the feasibility of closed-loop process
control. This work establishes fringe projection as a practical tool for
micrometer-scale monitoring in DED, bridging the gap between process signatures
and part geometry for certifiable additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Due to distribution shift, the performance of deep learning-based method for
image dehazing is adversely affected when applied to real-world hazy images. In
this paper, we find that such deviation in dehazing task between real and
synthetic domains may come from the imperfect collection of clean data. Owing
to the complexity of the scene and the effect of depth, the collected clean
data cannot strictly meet the ideal conditions, which makes the atmospheric
physics model in the real domain inconsistent with that in the synthetic
domain. For this reason, we come up with a synthetic-to-real dehazing method
based on domain unification, which attempts to unify the relationship between
the real and synthetic domain, thus to let the dehazing model more in line with
the actual situation. Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively
demonstrate that the proposed dehazing method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on real-world images.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new

Motivation: 虽然RLHF、DPO等方法在语言模型对齐中有效，但存在奖励黑客、奉承、标注者漂移和错误泛化等重复性失败模式，需要统一的理论框架来理解这些结构性限制。

Result: 建立了对齐差距的统一理论视角，识别了优化强度、价值捕获和泛化之间的根本性权衡，提出了MAPS（错误设定、标注、压力、偏移）实用设计框架。

Conclusion: 对齐存在结构性限制而非完全可解决，需要围绕权衡进行设计而非追求完美对齐，MAPS框架为未来对齐方法提供了更清晰的指导原则。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly aligned to human preferences through
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related methods such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI, and RLAIF. While
effective, these methods exhibit recurring failure patterns i.e., reward
hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, and misgeneralization. We introduce the
concept of the Alignment Gap, a unifying lens for understanding recurring
failures in feedback-based alignment. Using a KL-tilting formalism, we
illustrate why optimization pressure tends to amplify divergence between proxy
rewards and true human intent. We organize these failures into a catalogue of
Murphys Laws of AI Alignment, and propose the Alignment Trilemma as a way to
frame trade-offs among optimization strength, value capture, and
generalization. Small-scale empirical studies serve as illustrative support.
Finally, we propose the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure,
Shift) as practical design levers. Our contribution is not a definitive
impossibility theorem but a perspective that reframes alignment debates around
structural limits and trade-offs, offering clearer guidance for future design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and
demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural
language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding,
text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world
data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein
networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and
linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively
learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from
these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area.
Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures,
hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity
as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across
domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we
provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in
LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance
semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the
paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs
(HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log
maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4)
hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications
and outline future research directions. A repository of key papers, models,

Abstract: Patients must possess the knowledge necessary to actively participate in
their care. We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes
patient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built
on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL)
setup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight
LLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on
conversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation
strategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding
assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which
includes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates
that NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient
education, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it
received no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that
even simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can
successfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn
interactions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced
communication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot
surpasses non-expert human. Although our current focus is on healthcare, the
framework we present illustrates the feasibility and promise of applying
low-cost, PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains,
broadening the applicability of RL-based alignment methods.

Motivation: 现有的基于规则的奖励函数只评估答案格式和正确性，无法判断推理链是否真正改善答案，且任务特定训练对逻辑深度的控制有限

Method: DRER框架包含：(1)推理质量奖励 - 为那些确实提高正确答案可能性的推理链分配细粒度信用；(2)动态长度优势 - 对偏离验证阈值的响应长度进行优势衰减

Result: 7B模型在400训练步数下达到GPT-3-mini水平，CoT增强答案的平均置信度提升30%，在多个逻辑推理数据集和AIME24数学基准上表现出泛化能力

Conclusion: RL能够有效塑造CoT行为，为增强大语言模型的形式推理能力提供了实用路径

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for
strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the
rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming
benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to
whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer.
Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical
depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We
propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward
framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning
Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that
demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising
the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage
decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a
validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous
assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive
reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a
comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B
model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing
steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The
model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning
datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how
RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing
formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are

Motivation: 传统强化学习和指令蒸馏方法在开放域创造性生成中存在奖励信号不明确、奖励模型质量不高、训练成本昂贵等问题，需要新的深度推理范式来解决这些挑战。

Conclusion: REER范式为开放域创造性任务中的深度推理提供了新的解决方案，证明了逆向工程方法在解决复杂推理挑战方面的有效性。

Abstract: While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in
verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative
generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for
instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction
distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear
reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is
prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a
new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a
reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works
``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,
step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this
scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a
large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.
Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong
open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at
times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

Conclusion: EDIT方法有效解决了LRMs的过度思考问题，通过测试时缩放实现了推理效率的显著提升。

Abstract: O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward
over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to
generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide
range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are
prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple
problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted
reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we
conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set
of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple
generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery,
we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference
Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct
reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while
jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints,
allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between
conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency,
producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user
experience.

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM驱动的形式验证硬件合成提供了稳健、可扩展的自动化流水线，连接了自然语言规范和硅实现

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal
verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical
domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed
PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that
iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically
steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly
fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis
framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the
generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural
language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's
verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring
Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs
into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3)
employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a
challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization
consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by
up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis
success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis
flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for
LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language

Conclusion: TableMind通过自主工具调用和强化学习优化，有效解决了表格推理中的计算精度和自适应性问题。

Abstract: Table reasoning is crucial for leveraging structured data in domains such as
finance, healthcare, and scientific research. While large language models
(LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often
struggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations
inherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves
computational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems
frequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true
autonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven
table reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool
invocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox
environment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii)
exhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt
strategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning
paradigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool
usage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize
multi-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy
Optimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality
trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of
low-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and
more accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks
demonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to
competitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy
and computational precision.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning
and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research,
especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models.
Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One
such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and
reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development
of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling
and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up
pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an
autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on
context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training
recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement
learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills
while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL
recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source
LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam
benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose reasoning, showing
strong performance across diverse tasks. However, existing methods often rely
on implicit exploration, where the model follows stochastic and unguided
reasoning paths-like walking without a map. This leads to unstable reasoning
paths, lack of error correction, and limited learning from past experience. To
address these issues, we propose a framework that shifts from implicit
exploration to structured reasoning through guideline and refinement. First, we
extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and
reflective signals from failures. During inference, the model follows these
guidelines step-by-step, with refinement applied after each step to correct
errors and stabilize the reasoning process. Experiments on BBH and four
additional benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks.
Structured reasoning with stepwise execution and refinement improves stability
and generalization, while guidelines transfer well across domains and flexibly
support cross-model collaboration, matching or surpassing supervised
fine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling
long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where
information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized.
Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key
information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention
dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a
multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed
by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents
dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along
tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders
for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and
reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate
prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant
performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that
TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple
baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger

Abstract: With the growing demand for applying large language models to downstream
tasks, improving model alignment performance and efficiency has become crucial.
Such a process involves selecting informative instructions from a candidate
pool. However, due to the complexity of instruction set distributions, the key
factors driving the performance of aligned models remain unclear. As a result,
current instruction set refinement methods fail to improve performance as the
instruction pool expands continuously. To address this issue, we first
investigate the key factors that influence the relationship between instruction
dataset distribution and aligned model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a novel instruction data selection method. We identify that the depth
of instructions and the coverage of the semantic space are the crucial factors
determining downstream performance, which could explain over 70\% of the model
loss on the development set. We then design an instruction selection algorithm
to simultaneously maximize the depth and semantic coverage of the selected
instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to
state-of-the-art baseline methods, it can sustainably improve model performance
at a faster pace and thus achieve \emph{``Accelerated Scaling''}.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem
proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by
challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and
inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system
designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary
innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for
continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This
framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage
expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and
periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail
long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced
multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference
time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level
planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler
subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,
enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by
leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to
scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics
benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F
and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal
mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of
broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon
multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

Abstract: The cycle of scientific discovery is frequently bottlenecked by the slow,
manual creation of software to support computational experiments. To address
this, we present an AI system that creates expert-level scientific software
whose goal is to maximize a quality metric. The system uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) and Tree Search (TS) to systematically improve the quality metric
and intelligently navigate the large space of possible solutions. The system
achieves expert-level results when it explores and integrates complex research
ideas from external sources. The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated
across a wide range of benchmarks. In bioinformatics, it discovered 40 novel
methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed
methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated 14 models that
outperformed the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting
COVID-19 hospitalizations. Our method also produced state-of-the-art software
for geospatial analysis, neural activity prediction in zebrafish, time series
forecasting and numerical solution of integrals. By devising and implementing
novel solutions to diverse tasks, the system represents a significant step
towards accelerating scientific progress.

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by
coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool
use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,
and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains
impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such
as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers
from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.
Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,
off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective
trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human
defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled
comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction
research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,
recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence
on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations
of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three
axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research
covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit
design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)
agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture
and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,
VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We
distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer
practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with
RL.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多轮工作流中广泛应用，但缺乏系统方法来衡量迭代何时有益、何时有害，需要建立可量化的评估框架。

Method: 设计12轮控制对话实验，使用从模糊"改进它"到针对性引导的各种提示策略，通过领域特定的评估指标（单元测试、答案等价性、原创性等）和三个指标家族（语义移动、轮次间变化、输出大小增长）进行分析。

Result: 发现收益具有领域依赖性：创意和代码早期轮次收益明显，数学则需要后期详细阐述；模糊反馈容易导致性能停滞或倒退，针对性提示能可靠提升特定质量维度。

Conclusion: 该框架使迭代过程可测量和跨模型比较，为何时引导、停止或切换策略提供了信号，揭示了不同领域的迭代模式差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in multi-turn workflows, but we
still lack a clear way to measure when iteration helps and when it hurts. We
present an evaluation framework for iterative refinement that spans ideation,
code, and math. Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task,
utilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to
targeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with
domain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus
reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and
track turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement
across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and
tasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in
math late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns,
vague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts
reliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation;
speed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and
drives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation
moves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little
semantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late,
elaborative iteration.Together, the framework and metrics make iteration
measurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or
switch strategies.

TL;DR: RAFFLES是一个用于评估长时程多组件LLM智能体系统的迭代式评估架构，通过推理和迭代精化来识别系统故障点和原因，在Who&When基准测试中显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体系统的评估方法（如单次LLM-as-a-judge）存在局限性，只能关注单个指标或端到端结果，无法深入分析长时程多组件系统中的复杂逻辑和故障原因。需要能够推理、探测、迭代和理解系统复杂逻辑的评估框架。

Method: RAFFLES采用迭代式多组件流水线架构，使用中心Judge系统性地调查故障，并配备专门的Evaluators来评估系统组件质量和Judge自身的推理质量，构建假设历史记录。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，RAFFLES在算法生成数据集上达到43%以上的agent-step故障对准确率（相比之前最佳16.6%有显著提升），在手工制作数据集上达到20%以上（超越之前最佳8.8%）。

Conclusion: RAFFLES展示了为自主系统引入自动化故障检测的重要进展，相比劳动密集型人工审查具有明显优势，是朝着自动化故障检测方向的关键一步。

Abstract: We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of
long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to
identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that
currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that
they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,
and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match
the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,
probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems
over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation
architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.
Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using
a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized
Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of
the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We
tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark
designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure.
RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair
accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial
increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the
Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These
results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection
for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.

Motivation: 研究测试时扩展（test-time scaling）在知识密集型任务中的有效性，特别是在需要高事实准确性和低幻觉率的情况下

Method: 使用12个推理模型在两个知识密集型基准上进行全面评估，分析扩展推理对幻觉行为的影响

Result: 增加测试时计算并不能一致提高准确性，反而在很多情况下导致更多幻觉；模型选择弃答而非改善事实回忆来减少幻觉

Conclusion: 尽管有局限性，启用思考相比不思考仍然有益，但需要更谨慎地应用测试时扩展方法

Abstract: Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to
generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many
domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective
for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low
hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive
benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not
consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more
hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination
behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model
choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual
recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on
previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case
studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to
overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that
compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have undergone safety alignment efforts to
mitigate harmful outputs. However, as LLMs become more sophisticated in
reasoning, their intelligence may introduce new security risks. While
traditional jailbreak attacks relied on singlestep attacks, multi-turn
jailbreak strategies that adapt dynamically to context remain underexplored. In
this work, we introduce TRIAL (Trolley-problem Reasoning for Interactive Attack
Logic), a framework that leverages LLMs ethical reasoning to bypass their
safeguards. TRIAL embeds adversarial goals within ethical dilemmas modeled on
the trolley problem. TRIAL demonstrates high jailbreak success rates towards
both open and close-source models. Our findings underscore a fundamental
limitation in AI safety: as models gain advanced reasoning abilities, the
nature of their alignment may inadvertently allow for more covert security
vulnerabilities to be exploited. TRIAL raises an urgent need in reevaluating
safety alignment oversight strategies, as current safeguards may prove
insufficient against context-aware adversarial attack.

Conclusion: 伪装越狱攻击暴露了LLMs的安全脆弱性，迫切需要更细致和自适应的安全策略来确保LLM在现实应用中的负责任和稳健部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to a sophisticated
form of adversarial prompting known as camouflaged jailbreaking. This method
embeds malicious intent within seemingly benign language to evade existing
safety mechanisms. Unlike overt attacks, these subtle prompts exploit
contextual ambiguity and the flexible nature of language, posing significant
challenges to current defense systems. This paper investigates the construction
and impact of camouflaged jailbreak prompts, emphasizing their deceptive
characteristics and the limitations of traditional keyword-based detection
methods. We introduce a novel benchmark dataset, Camouflaged Jailbreak Prompts,
containing 500 curated examples (400 harmful and 100 benign prompts) designed
to rigorously stress-test LLM safety protocols. In addition, we propose a
multi-faceted evaluation framework that measures harmfulness across seven
dimensions: Safety Awareness, Technical Feasibility, Implementation Safeguards,
Harmful Potential, Educational Value, Content Quality, and Compliance Score.
Our findings reveal a stark contrast in LLM behavior: while models demonstrate
high safety and content quality with benign inputs, they exhibit a significant
decline in performance and safety when confronted with camouflaged jailbreak
attempts. This disparity underscores a pervasive vulnerability, highlighting
the urgent need for more nuanced and adaptive security strategies to ensure the
responsible and robust deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

Result: 虽然可以成功注入分解式后门毒药，但可靠地激活这些后门来改变最终答案（而不仅仅是推理链）异常困难。模型经常能够从其思维过程中被激活的后门中恢复。

Conclusion: 先进大语言模型的推理能力以及推理与最终答案生成之间的架构分离，产生了一种新兴的后门鲁棒性形式，使得针对推理链的投毒攻击难以影响最终输出。

Abstract: Early research into data poisoning attacks against Large Language Models
(LLMs) demonstrated the ease with which backdoors could be injected. More
recent LLMs add step-by-step reasoning, expanding the attack surface to include
the intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) and its inherent trait of decomposing
problems into subproblems. Using these vectors for more stealthy poisoning, we
introduce ``decomposed reasoning poison'', in which the attacker modifies only
the reasoning path, leaving prompts and final answers clean, and splits the
trigger across multiple, individually harmless components.
  Fascinatingly, while it remains possible to inject these decomposed poisons,
reliably activating them to change final answers (rather than just the CoT) is
surprisingly difficult. This difficulty arises because the models can often
recover from backdoors that are activated within their thought processes.
Ultimately, it appears that an emergent form of backdoor robustness is
originating from the reasoning capabilities of these advanced LLMs, as well as
from the architectural separation between reasoning and final answer
generation.

Abstract: LLM-based agentic systems leverage large language models to handle user

domains like chatbots, customer service, and software engineering. A critical
component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines
tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and
correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been
largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks,
revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are
vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service
(DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate
external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also
propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into web-based

attacks remains a pressing concern. In this study, we explore how non-visible
HTML elements such as <meta>, aria-label, and alt attributes can be exploited
to embed adversarial instructions without altering the visible content of a
webpage. We introduce a novel dataset comprising 280 static web pages, evenly
divided between clean and adversarial injected versions, crafted using diverse
HTML-based strategies. These pages are processed through a browser automation
pipeline to extract both raw HTML and rendered text, closely mimicking
real-world LLM deployment scenarios. We evaluate two state-of-the-art
open-source models, Llama 4 Scout (Meta) and Gemma 9B IT (Google), on their
ability to summarize this content. Using both lexical (ROUGE-L) and semantic
(SBERT cosine similarity) metrics, along with manual annotations, we assess the
impact of these covert injections. Our findings reveal that over 29% of
injected samples led to noticeable changes in the Llama 4 Scout summaries,
while Gemma 9B IT showed a lower, yet non-trivial, success rate of 15%. These
results highlight a critical and largely overlooked vulnerability in LLM driven
web pipelines, where hidden adversarial content can subtly manipulate model
outputs. Our work offers a reproducible framework and benchmark for evaluating
HTML-based prompt injection and underscores the urgent need for robust
mitigation strategies in LLM applications involving web content.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption in recent years, with
industries increasingly relying on them to maintain a competitive advantage.
These models excel at interpreting user instructions and generating human-like
responses, leading to their integration across diverse domains, including
consulting and information retrieval. However, their widespread deployment also
introduces substantial security risks, most notably in the form of prompt
injection and jailbreak attacks.
  To systematically evaluate LLM vulnerabilities -- particularly to external
prompt injection -- we conducted a series of experiments on eight commercial
models. Each model was tested without supplementary sanitization, relying
solely on its built-in safeguards. The results exposed exploitable weaknesses
and emphasized the need for stronger security measures. Four categories of
attacks were examined: direct injection, indirect (external) injection,
image-based injection, and prompt leakage. Comparative analysis indicated that
Claude 3 demonstrated relatively greater robustness; nevertheless, empirical
findings confirm that additional defenses, such as input normalization, remain
necessary to achieve reliable protection.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used to simulate human opinion
dynamics, yet the effect of genuine interaction is often obscured by systematic
biases. We present a Bayesian framework to disentangle and quantify three such
biases: (i) a topic bias toward prior opinions in the training data; (ii) an
agreement bias favoring agreement irrespective of the question; and (iii) an
anchoring bias toward the initiating agent's stance. Applying this framework to
multi-step dialogues reveals that opinion trajectories tend to quickly converge
to a shared attractor, with the influence of the interaction fading over time,
and the impact of biases differing between LLMs. In addition, we fine-tune an
LLM on different sets of strongly opinionated statements (incl. misinformation)
and demonstrate that the opinion attractor shifts correspondingly. Exposing
stark differences between LLMs and providing quantitative tools to compare them
to human subjects in the future, our approach highlights both chances and
pitfalls in using LLMs as proxies for human behavior.

empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task that

answers to ten questions of mixed formats with correctness labels, each LLM is
required to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components,
(ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance

Method: 使用自相关分析方法，在语义嵌入空间中分析两种prompt生成策略：系统枚举（1,024个prompts）和新颖多样化（1,000个prompts），并在10个错误检测类别上进行任务特异性分析

Result: 系统化prompt生成产生平滑衰减的自相关，而多样化生成呈现非单调模式，在中间语义距离处出现相关峰值，表明地形曲折、具有层次结构。不同错误类型呈现不同程度的地形曲折性

Conclusion: 研究揭示了prompt工程优化地形的复杂结构，为设计更有效的prompt优化算法提供了理论基础，对理解LLM在prompt优化中的行为有重要意义

Abstract: While prompt engineering has emerged as a crucial technique for optimizing
large language model performance, the underlying optimization landscape remains
poorly understood. Current approaches treat prompt optimization as a black-box
problem, applying sophisticated search algorithms without characterizing the
landscape topology they navigate. We present a systematic analysis of fitness
landscape structures in prompt engineering using autocorrelation analysis
across semantic embedding spaces. Through experiments on error detection tasks
with two distinct prompt generation strategies -- systematic enumeration (1,024
prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts) -- we reveal
fundamentally different landscape topologies. Systematic prompt generation
yields smoothly decaying autocorrelation, while diversified generation exhibits
non-monotonic patterns with peak correlation at intermediate semantic
distances, indicating rugged, hierarchically structured landscapes.
Task-specific analysis across 10 error detection categories reveals varying
degrees of ruggedness across different error types. Our findings provide an
empirical foundation for understanding the complexity of optimization in prompt
engineering landscapes.

Conclusion: 该研究强调了元认知知识编辑的重要性，提出的CogEdit基准和MIND框架为提升MLLMs的知识更新能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a
focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge
editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing,
assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary
Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended
interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of
uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND
(Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that
constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic
interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement
for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly
outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance
on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Conclusion: MapAgent通过分层设计和专用工具集有效解决了地理空间推理的挑战，降低了认知负担，提高了工具选择准确性。

Abstract: Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most
existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web
automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,
multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,
we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with
customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial
reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools
uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different
geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level
planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to
specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then
design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs
adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the
query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)
operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces
cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise
coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse
geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and
MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented
and agentic baselines. We open-source our framwork at

enriched with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, and retrieves
adaptable plan schemas to generate tailored action plans. A Large Language

metrics for personalization and explainability, including Personalization
Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy, to rigorously assess its
performance. Results indicate that CSM based agents can provide more context

Abstract: Questionnaire-based surveys are foundational to social science research and
public policymaking, yet traditional survey methods remain costly,
time-consuming, and often limited in scale. This paper explores a new paradigm:
simulating virtual survey respondents using Large Language Models (LLMs). We
introduce two novel simulation settings, namely Partial Attribute Simulation
(PAS) and Full Attribute Simulation (FAS), to systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate accurate and demographically coherent responses. In
PAS, the model predicts missing attributes based on partial respondent
profiles, whereas FAS involves generating complete synthetic datasets under
both zero-context and context-enhanced conditions. We curate a comprehensive
benchmark suite, LLM-S^3 (Large Language Model-based Sociodemographic Survey
Simulation), that spans 11 real-world public datasets across four sociological
domains. Our evaluation of multiple mainstream LLMs (GPT-3.5/4 Turbo, LLaMA

failure modes, and demonstrates how context and prompt design impact simulation
fidelity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for LLM-driven survey

Conclusion: 该框架为结构化异构数据的RAG提供了可扩展且隐私合规的解决方案，在敏感和多样化数据环境中释放了LLM的潜力。

Abstract: Centralized RAG pipelines struggle with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive
data, especially in distributed healthcare settings where patient data spans
SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties
retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of
traditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge
devices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient
Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an
edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across
diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are:
(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which
supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and
unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into
standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs
integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate
lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three
anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,
de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize
response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier
caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,
and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate
that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality,
generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable
and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data,
unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments.

Abstract: Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding
in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper
proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like
cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a
plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and
Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select"
cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to
guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves
cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering.
Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional
entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing
unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and
Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with
their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields
consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline
combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points,
demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch"
reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research
papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive
artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and
discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial
effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own

challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a
knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the
associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol
(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify
the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat
agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through
natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We
demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper
agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that
leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy
and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We
validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and
can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into

Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on
selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves
near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range
dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we
embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth
images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact
tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse
these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and
memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and
providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the
policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and
appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact
state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We
evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and
moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art
baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great potential for autonomous
decision-making in the cybersecurity domain, enabling agents to learn through
direct environment interaction. However, RL agents in Autonomous Cyber
Operations (ACO) typically learn from scratch, requiring them to execute
undesirable actions to learn their consequences. In this study, we integrate
external knowledge in the form of a Large Language Model (LLM) pretrained on
cybersecurity data that our RL agent can directly leverage to make informed
decisions. By guiding initial training with an LLM, we improve baseline
performance and reduce the need for exploratory actions with obviously negative
outcomes. We evaluate our LLM-integrated approach in a simulated cybersecurity
environment, and demonstrate that our guided agent achieves over 2x higher
rewards during early training and converges to a favorable policy approximately

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has pushed their
boundaries to many applications in various domains. Recently, the research
community has started to evaluate their potential adoption in autonomous
vehicles and especially as complementary modules in the perception and planning
software stacks. However, their evaluation is limited in synthetic datasets or
manually driving datasets without the ground truth knowledge and more
precisely, how the current perception and planning algorithms would perform in
the cases under evaluation. For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on
real-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to
fail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector
coupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning.
We evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide

Abstract: The use of unvetted third-party and internet data renders pre-trained models
susceptible to backdoor attacks. Detecting backdoor samples is critical to
prevent backdoor activation during inference or injection during training.
However, existing detection methods often require the defender to have access
to the poisoned models, extra clean samples, or significant computational
resources to detect backdoor samples, limiting their practicality. To address
this limitation, we propose a backdoor sample detection method based on
perturbatio\textbf{N} discr\textbf{E}pancy consis\textbf{T}ency
\textbf{E}valuation (\NETE). This is a novel detection method that can be used
both pre-training and post-training phases. In the detection process, it only
requires an off-the-shelf pre-trained model to compute the log probability of
samples and an automated function based on a mask-filling strategy to generate
perturbations. Our method is based on the interesting phenomenon that the
change in perturbation discrepancy for backdoor samples is smaller than that
for clean samples. Based on this phenomenon, we use curvature to measure the
discrepancy in log probabilities between different perturbed samples and input
samples, thereby evaluating the consistency of the perturbation discrepancy to
determine whether the input sample is a backdoor sample. Experiments conducted
on four typical backdoor attacks and five types of large language model
backdoor attacks demonstrate that our detection strategy outperforms existing
zero-shot black-box detection methods.

TL;DR: BinaryShield是一个隐私保护的威胁情报系统，通过PII脱敏、语义嵌入、二进制量化和随机响应机制生成不可逆指纹，实现跨合规边界的安全攻击指纹共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业部署多个LLM服务处理数十亿查询，但监管合规边界阻止了服务间共享提示注入攻击的威胁情报，导致攻击在一个服务中被检测到后，在其他服务中可能数月未被发现。

Method: 结合PII脱敏、语义嵌入、二进制量化和随机响应机制的独特流水线，生成保留攻击模式但提供隐私保护的非可逆指纹。

Result: BinaryShield达到0.94的F1分数，显著优于隐私保护基线SimHash（0.77），同时实现64倍存储减少和38倍更快的相似性搜索。

Conclusion: BinaryShield有效解决了LLM服务间威胁情报共享的隐私合规问题，在保持高检测性能的同时大幅提升了效率和存储效率。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLMs across enterprise services has created a
critical security blind spot. Organizations operate multiple LLM services
handling billions of queries daily, yet regulatory compliance boundaries
prevent these services from sharing threat intelligence about prompt injection
attacks, the top security risk for LLMs. When an attack is detected in one
service, the same threat may persist undetected in others for months, as
privacy regulations prohibit sharing user prompts across compliance boundaries.
  We present BinaryShield, the first privacy-preserving threat intelligence
system that enables secure sharing of attack fingerprints across compliance
boundaries. BinaryShield transforms suspicious prompts through a unique
pipeline combining PII redaction, semantic embedding, binary quantization, and
randomized response mechanism to potentially generate non-invertible
fingerprints that preserve attack patterns while providing privacy. Our
evaluations demonstrate that BinaryShield achieves an F1-score of 0.94,
significantly outperforming SimHash (0.77), the privacy-preserving baseline,
while achieving 64x storage reduction and 38x faster similarity search compared
to dense embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的源代码安全补丁检测方法无法应用于闭源软件的二进制补丁检测，而代码LLMs在二进制分析任务中表现出色但在此关键安全任务中尚未探索。

Method: 构建包含19,448个样本的二进制补丁数据集（汇编代码和伪代码两种表示），系统评估19个不同规模的代码LLM，并研究微调策略来注入二进制安全补丁检测的领域知识。

Result: 直接提示普通代码LLMs难以准确识别二进制安全补丁，即使使用最先进的提示技术也无法弥补领域知识缺乏。微调后的LLMs表现出色，在伪代码表示上获得最佳结果。

Conclusion: 代码LLMs通过适当的微调可以有效地用于二进制安全补丁检测任务，伪代码表示比汇编代码表示更有效。

Abstract: Security patch detection (SPD) is crucial for maintaining software security,
as unpatched vulnerabilities can lead to severe security risks. In recent
years, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising
results on source code. However, these approaches typically cannot be applied
to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a
significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with
binary files, and the source code is inaccessible. Given the impressive
performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and
binary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their
potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a
significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code
understanding capabilities and this critical security task. To address this
gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \textbf{19,448}
samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and
systematically evaluate \textbf{19} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate
their capability in binary SPD tasks. Our initial exploration demonstrates that
directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security
patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques
fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla
models. Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning
strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two
levels of representation. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs
achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the
pseudo-code representation.

Result: 在ARC Prize 2025数据集上达到96%准确率，显著优于Transformer基线(1.3%)、Grok-4(15.9%)和SOAR(52%)等模型，仅使用150万参数。消融研究表明边缘投影是最关键组件。

Conclusion: TreeGPT通过结合注意力机制和树结构建模，在程序合成任务中表现出色，证明了混合架构在处理层次化数据结构方面的优势。

Abstract: We introduce TreeGPT, a novel neural architecture that combines
transformer-based attention mechanisms with global parent-child aggregation for
processing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in neural program synthesis tasks.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on sequential processing or
graph neural networks, TreeGPT employs a hybrid design that leverages both
self-attention for capturing local dependencies and a specialized Tree
Feed-Forward Network (TreeFFN) for modeling hierarchical tree structures
through iterative message passing.
  The core innovation lies in our Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism,
formalized as: $$h_i^{(t+1)} = \sigma \Big( h_i^{(0)} + W_{pc} \sum_{(p,c) \in
E_i} f(h_p^{(t)}, h_c^{(t)}) + b \Big)$$ where $h_i^{(t)}$ represents the
hidden state of node $i$ at iteration $t$, $E_i$ denotes all parent-child edges
involving node $i$, and $f(h_p, h_c)$ is an edge aggregation function. This
formulation enables each node to progressively aggregate information from the
entire tree structure through $T$ iterations.
  Our architecture integrates optional enhancements including gated aggregation
with learnable edge weights, residual connections for gradient stability, and
bidirectional propagation for capturing both bottom-up and top-down
dependencies. We evaluate TreeGPT on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset, a challenging
visual reasoning benchmark requiring abstract pattern recognition and rule
inference. Experimental results demonstrate that TreeGPT achieves 96\%
accuracy, significantly outperforming transformer baselines (1.3\%),
large-scale models like Grok-4 (15.9\%), and specialized program synthesis
methods like SOAR (52\%) while using only 1.5M parameters. Our comprehensive
ablation study reveals that edge projection is the most critical component,
with the combination of edge projection and gating achieving optimal

Method: 提出OccVLA框架，将密集3D占据既作为预测输出又作为监督信号，使模型能够直接从2D视觉输入学习细粒度空间结构。占据预测被视为隐式推理过程，在推理时可跳过而不影响性能。

Conclusion: OccVLA通过创新的3D占据表示方法，成功提升了多模态模型在3D空间理解方面的能力，为自动驾驶等需要精确空间推理的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language
reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is
critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges:
(1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations
without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial
details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language
pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework
that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal
reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs,
OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory
signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly
from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit
reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance
degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and
demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks,
offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for
autonomous driving.

Motivation: 传统的建筑能源改造决策方法存在泛化性有限和可解释性低的问题，阻碍了在不同住宅环境中的采用。随着智能和连接社区的发展，生成式AI特别是大型语言模型可能通过处理上下文信息来生成从业人员可读的建议。

Method: 评估了7种LLM（ChatGPT、DeepSeek、Gemini、Grok、Llama和Claude）在住宅改造决策中的表现，使用包含49个美国州400个住宅的数据集，从准确性、一致性、敏感性和推理四个维度进行评估。

Result: LLMs在许多情况下能生成有效的建议，技术目标表现更强，模型间一致性较低，高性能模型往往与其他模型不同。模型对位置和建筑几何形状敏感，但对技术和居住者行为不太敏感。大多数模型展示逐步的工程式推理，但往往简化且缺乏深度上下文意识。

Conclusion: LLMs在能源改造决策中是有前景的助手，但在准确性、一致性和上下文处理方面需要改进才能可靠应用。

Abstract: Conventional approaches to building energy retrofit decision making suffer
from limited generalizability and low interpretability, hindering adoption in
diverse residential contexts. With the growth of Smart and Connected
Communities, generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), may help
by processing contextual information and producing practitioner readable
recommendations. We evaluate seven LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok,
Llama, and Claude) on residential retrofit decisions under two objectives:
maximizing CO2 reduction (technical) and minimizing payback period
(sociotechnical). Performance is assessed on four dimensions: accuracy,
consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning, using a dataset of 400 homes across 49
US states. LLMs generate effective recommendations in many cases, reaching up
to 54.5 percent top 1 match and 92.8 percent within top 5 without fine tuning.
Performance is stronger for the technical objective, while sociotechnical
decisions are limited by economic trade offs and local context. Agreement
across models is low, and higher performing models tend to diverge from others.
LLMs are sensitive to location and building geometry but less sensitive to
technology and occupant behavior. Most models show step by step, engineering
style reasoning, but it is often simplified and lacks deeper contextual
awareness. Overall, LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision
making, but improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling are
needed for reliable practice.

Conclusion: ProtSAE通过语义引导的稀疏自编码方法有效解决了蛋白质语言模型中的特征纠缠问题，为机制可解释性提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) has emerged as a powerful tool for mechanistic
interpretability of large language models. Recent works apply SAE to protein
language models (PLMs), aiming to extract and analyze biologically meaningful
features from their latent spaces. However, SAE suffers from semantic
entanglement, where individual neurons often mix multiple nonlinear concepts,
making it difficult to reliably interpret or manipulate model behaviors. In
this paper, we propose a semantically-guided SAE, called ProtSAE. Unlike
existing SAE which requires annotation datasets to filter and interpret
activations, we guide semantic disentanglement during training using both
annotation datasets and domain knowledge to mitigate the effects of entangled
attributes. We design interpretability experiments showing that ProtSAE learns
more biologically relevant and interpretable hidden features compared to
previous methods. Performance analyses further demonstrate that ProtSAE
maintains high reconstruction fidelity while achieving better results in
interpretable probing. We also show the potential of ProtSAE in steering PLMs
for downstream generation tasks.

Conclusion: 这是首个将实时诈骗诱捕、联邦隐私保护和校准安全监管统一到主动防御范式中的框架，表明可以在不牺牲性能的情况下实现强大的隐私保护。

Abstract: Scams exploiting real-time social engineering -- such as phishing,
impersonation, and phone fraud -- remain a persistent and evolving threat
across digital platforms. Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering
limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving,
AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam
conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial
intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with
harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model
updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system
produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement
$\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism,
safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models
trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement
($\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage
($\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain
stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing
performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3,
MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce
the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the
model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer
and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of
higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify
real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety
moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.

Abstract: Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences
presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in
understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships
between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that
incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code
generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence,
which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal
coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code
generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code
reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness
and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly
enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and
code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and
spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce
LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action
sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial
complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that
existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework
establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.

Conclusion: 需要提高透明度和问责制，解决用户缺乏同意、数据安全问题和儿童数据使用等问题，为政策制定者和开发者提供建议以应对LLM聊天机器人带来的数据隐私挑战。

Abstract: Hundreds of millions of people now regularly interact with large language
models via chatbots. Model developers are eager to acquire new sources of
high-quality training data as they race to improve model capabilities and win
market share. This paper analyzes the privacy policies of six U.S. frontier AI
developers to understand how they use their users' chats to train models.
Drawing primarily on the California Consumer Privacy Act, we develop a novel
qualitative coding schema that we apply to each developer's relevant privacy
policies to compare data collection and use practices across the six companies.
We find that all six developers appear to employ their users' chat data to
train and improve their models by default, and that some retain this data
indefinitely. Developers may collect and train on personal information
disclosed in chats, including sensitive information such as biometric and
health data, as well as files uploaded by users. Four of the six companies we
examined appear to include children's chat data for model training, as well as
customer data from other products. On the whole, developers' privacy policies
often lack essential information about their practices, highlighting the need
for greater transparency and accountability. We address the implications of
users' lack of consent for the use of their chat data for model training, data
security issues arising from indefinite chat data retention, and training on
children's chat data. We conclude by providing recommendations to policymakers
and developers to address the data privacy challenges posed by LLM-powered
chatbots.

TL;DR: 该研究使用Claude Sonnet 3.7 LLM动态合成包含1%内部威胁指标的系统日志，并比较了Claude Sonnet 3.7和GPT-4o在内部威胁检测中的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内部威胁研究依赖静态和访问受限的数据集，限制了自适应检测模型的发展。需要一种新的方法来生成动态的合成数据以支持更好的威胁检测。

Method: 使用Claude Sonnet 3.7 LLM动态合成高度不平衡（1%内部威胁）的系统日志消息，然后使用Claude Sonnet 3.7和GPT-4o分析这些日志中的内部威胁，并通过精确率、召回率、MCC和ROC AUC等统计指标评估性能。

Result: Claude Sonnet 3.7在几乎所有指标上都优于GPT-4o，特别是在减少误报和提高检测准确性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: LLM在合成数据集生成和内部威胁检测方面显示出强大潜力，Claude Sonnet 3.7在此任务中表现优于GPT-4o。

Abstract: Insider threats are a growing organizational problem due to the complexity of
identifying their technical and behavioral elements. A large research body is
dedicated to the study of insider threats from technological, psychological,
and educational perspectives. However, research in this domain has been
generally dependent on datasets that are static and limited access which
restricts the development of adaptive detection models. This study introduces a
novel, ethically grounded approach that uses the large language model (LLM)
Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages, some of which
contain indicators of insider threat scenarios. The messages reflect real-world
data distributions by being highly imbalanced (1% insider threats). The syslogs
were analyzed for insider threats by both Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o, with
their performance evaluated through statistical metrics including precision,
recall, MCC, and ROC AUC. Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across
nearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving
detection accuracy. The results show strong promise for the use of LLMs in
synthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决REST API测试的复杂性挑战，包括分布式系统的固有复杂性、多种可能场景以及有限的测试设计时间，避免未检测到的故障和高手动工作量。

Method: 结合测试规范语言(TSL)和大型语言模型(LLMs)，通过提示工程技术和自动化流水线，从OpenAPI规范生成测试用例，评估不同LLM的性能。

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet在所有指标上表现最佳，其次是Deepseek R1、Qwen 2.5 32b和Sabia 3，这些模型能够生成健壮且上下文连贯的REST API测试。

Conclusion: LLMs在基于API规范自动化生成测试方面具有巨大潜力，Claude 3.5 Sonnet被证明是最适合此任务的模型。

Abstract: The effective execution of tests for REST APIs remains a considerable
challenge for development teams, driven by the inherent complexity of
distributed systems, the multitude of possible scenarios, and the limited time
available for test design. Exhaustive testing of all input combinations is
impractical, often resulting in undetected failures, high manual effort, and
limited test coverage. To address these issues, we introduce RestTSLLM, an
approach that uses Test Specification Language (TSL) in conjunction with Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test cases for REST APIs.
The approach targets two core challenges: the creation of test scenarios and
the definition of appropriate input data. The proposed solution integrates
prompt engineering techniques with an automated pipeline to evaluate various
LLMs on their ability to generate tests from OpenAPI specifications. The
evaluation focused on metrics such as success rate, test coverage, and mutation
score, enabling a systematic comparison of model performance. The results
indicate that the best-performing LLMs - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic),
Deepseek R1 (Deepseek), Qwen 2.5 32b (Alibaba), and Sabia 3 (Maritaca) -
consistently produced robust and contextually coherent REST API tests. Among
them, Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed all other models across every metric,
emerging in this study as the most suitable model for this task. These findings
highlight the potential of LLMs to automate the generation of tests based on
API specifications.

interaction, Orchestrator mitigates the effects of partial observability and
enables agents to approximate global task solutions more efficiently. We
evaluate the framework on a series of maze puzzles of increasing complexity,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing coordination and performance in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在自动化地理空间分析方面的应用日益增多，但对其实际能力缺乏严谨评估。作者呼吁在声称完全自动化GIS工作流之前，需要对LLMs在明确定义的地理处理任务上进行严格评估。

Method: 开发了GeoAnalystBench基准测试，包含50个基于Python的真实地理空间任务，每个任务都配有最小交付产品。评估包括工作流有效性、结构对齐、语义相似性和代码质量（CodeBLEU）。使用该基准评估了专有和开源模型。

Result: 专有模型如ChatGPT-4o-mini表现优异（95%有效性，CodeBLEU 0.39），而较小的开源模型如DeepSeek-R1-7B经常生成不完整或不一致的工作流（48.5%有效性，CodeBLEU 0.272）。需要深度空间推理的任务（如空间关系检测或最优选址）对所有模型都最具挑战性。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在GIS自动化方面既有前景也有局限性，研究提供了一个可复现的框架来推进GeoAI研究，并强调需要人机协同支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have fueled growing interest
in automating geospatial analysis and GIS workflows, yet their actual
capabilities remain uncertain. In this work, we call for rigorous evaluation of
LLMs on well-defined geoprocessing tasks before making claims about full GIS
automation. To this end, we present GeoAnalystBench, a benchmark of 50
Python-based tasks derived from real-world geospatial problems and carefully
validated by GIS experts. Each task is paired with a minimum deliverable
product, and evaluation covers workflow validity, structural alignment,
semantic similarity, and code quality (CodeBLEU). Using this benchmark, we
assess both proprietary and open source models. Results reveal a clear gap:
proprietary models such as ChatGPT-4o-mini achieve high validity 95% and
stronger code alignment (CodeBLEU 0.39), while smaller open source models like
DeepSeek-R1-7B often generate incomplete or inconsistent workflows (48.5%
validity, 0.272 CodeBLEU). Tasks requiring deeper spatial reasoning, such as
spatial relationship detection or optimal site selection, remain the most
challenging across all models. These findings demonstrate both the promise and
limitations of current LLMs in GIS automation and provide a reproducible
framework to advance GeoAI research with human-in-the-loop support.

Motivation: 现有针对RAG系统的成员推理攻击忽略了非成员检索文档对输出的干扰，导致攻击效果有限。RAG系统在处理敏感数据时存在隐私泄露风险

Method: 提出DCMI方法，利用查询扰动生成校准查询，隔离成员检索文档的贡献，最小化非成员检索文档的干扰

Result: 在逐步放宽假设的实验条件下，DCMI始终优于基线方法，例如在Flan-T5 RAG系统中达到97.42% AUC和94.35%准确率，比MBA基线提高40%以上。在真实RAG平台Dify和MaxKB上保持10%-20%的优势

Conclusion: RAG系统存在显著的隐私风险，需要更强的保护机制。呼吁社区对快速发展的RAG系统中的数据泄露风险进行更深入的研究

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively reduces hallucinations
by integrating external knowledge bases, it introduces vulnerabilities to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), particularly in systems handling sensitive
data. Existing MIAs targeting RAG's external databases often rely on model
responses but ignore the interference of non-member-retrieved documents on RAG
outputs, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose DCMI, a
differential calibration MIA that mitigates the negative impact of
non-member-retrieved documents. Specifically, DCMI leverages the sensitivity
gap between member and non-member retrieved documents under query perturbation.
It generates perturbed queries for calibration to isolate the contribution of
member-retrieved documents while minimizing the interference from
non-member-retrieved documents. Experiments under progressively relaxed
assumptions show that DCMI consistently outperforms baselines--for example,
achieving 97.42% AUC and 94.35% Accuracy against the RAG system with Flan-T5,
exceeding the MBA baseline by over 40%. Furthermore, on real-world RAG
platforms such as Dify and MaxKB, DCMI maintains a 10%-20% advantage over the
baseline. These results highlight significant privacy risks in RAG systems and
emphasize the need for stronger protection mechanisms. We appeal to the
community's consideration of deeper investigations, like ours, against the data
leakage risks in rapidly evolving RAG systems. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DreamAudio成功实现了定制化文本到音频生成，能够精确控制特定音频事件的生成，为个性化音频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the development of large-scale diffusion-based and
language-modeling-based generative models, impressive progress has been
achieved in text-to-audio generation. Despite producing high-quality outputs,
existing text-to-audio models mainly aim to generate semantically aligned sound
and fall short on precisely controlling fine-grained acoustic characteristics
of specific sounds. As a result, users that need specific sound content may
find it challenging to generate the desired audio clips. In this paper, we
present DreamAudio for customized text-to-audio generation (CTTA).
Specifically, we introduce a new framework that is designed to enable the model
to identify auditory information from user-provided reference concepts for
audio generation. Given a few reference audio samples containing personalized
audio events, our system can generate new audio samples that include these
specific events. In addition, two types of datasets are developed for training
and testing the customized systems. The experiments show that the proposed
model, DreamAudio, generates audio samples that are highly consistent with the
customized audio features and aligned well with the input text prompts.
Furthermore, DreamAudio offers comparable performance in general text-to-audio
tasks. We also provide a human-involved dataset containing audio events from
real-world CTTA cases as the benchmark for customized generation tasks.

Abstract: Agentic Software Engineering (SE 3.0) represents a new era where intelligent
agents are tasked not with simple code generation, but with achieving complex,
goal-oriented SE objectives. To harness these new capabilities while ensuring
trustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in
the Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE
for Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational
pillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest
differently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to
support this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command
center where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such
as Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The
Agent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform
tasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex
trade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated
human callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering
activities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating
the practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering. This
paper presents the Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision,
outlining several of the foundational pillars for the future of SE. The paper
culminates in a research roadmap that identifies a few key challenges and
opportunities while briefly discussing the resulting impact of this future on
SE education. Our goal is not to offer a definitive solution, but to provide a
conceptual scaffold with structured vocabulary to catalyze a community-wide
dialogue, pushing the SE community to think beyond its classic, human-centric
tenets toward a disciplined, scalable, and trustworthy agentic future.

Abstract: As on-device LLMs(e.g., Apple on-device Intelligence) are widely adopted to
reduce network dependency, improve privacy, and enhance responsiveness,
verifying the legitimacy of models running on local devices becomes critical.
Existing attestation techniques are not suitable for billion-parameter Large

algorithm/software/hardware co-design approach to embed robust watermarking
signatures onto the activation distributions of LLM building blocks. It also
optimizes the attestation protocol within the Trusted Execution Environment

throughput. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations on LLMs from Llama, Qwen,

Abstract: We introduce Plantbot, a hybrid lifeform that connects a living plant with a
mobile robot through a network of large language model (LLM) modules. Each
module - responsible for sensing, vision, dialogue, or action - operates
asynchronously and communicates via natural language, enabling seamless
interaction across biological and artificial domains. This architecture
leverages the capacity of LLMs to serve as hybrid interfaces, where natural
language functions as a universal protocol, translating multimodal data (soil
moisture, temperature, visual context) into linguistic messages that coordinate
system behaviors. The integrated network transforms plant states into robotic
actions, installing normativity essential for agency within the sensor-motor
loop. By combining biological and robotic elements through LLM-mediated
communication, Plantbot behaves as an embodied, adaptive agent capable of
responding autonomously to environmental conditions. This approach suggests
possibilities for a new model of artificial life, where decentralized, LLM
modules coordination enable novel interactions between biological and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型作为新型软件依赖项(Software Dependencies 2.0)的广泛应用对软件系统的可维护性和可靠性构成潜在威胁，需要了解开发者在实际项目中如何集成和管理这些模型。

Method: 采用混合方法分析，从PeaTMOSS数据集的28,575个仓库中随机抽样401个GitHub仓库，定量分析PTM重用模式，定性研究开发者集成和管理实践。

Result: 研究发现开源项目在PTM依赖项的结构化、文档化方面存在特定模式，识别了PTM重用管道中的阶段和组织模式，以及不同学习组件在管道阶段的交互关系。

Conclusion: 预训练模型作为软件依赖项的集成实践需要更系统的管理方法，研究为理解Software Dependencies 2.0的实际应用提供了实证基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained models (PTMs) are machine learning models that have been trained
in advance, often on large-scale data, and can be reused for new tasks, thereby
reducing the need for costly training from scratch. Their widespread adoption
introduces a new class of software dependency, which we term Software
Dependencies 2.0, extending beyond conventional libraries to learned behaviors
embodied in trained models and their associated artifacts. The integration of
PTMs as software dependencies in real projects remains unclear, potentially
threatening maintainability and reliability of modern software systems that
increasingly rely on them. Objective: In this study, we investigate Software
Dependencies 2.0 in open-source software (OSS) projects by examining the reuse
of PTMs, with a focus on how developers manage and integrate these models.
Specifically, we seek to understand: (1) how OSS projects structure and
document their PTM dependencies; (2) what stages and organizational patterns
emerge in the reuse pipelines of PTMs within these projects; and (3) the
interactions among PTMs and other learned components across pipeline stages. We
conduct a mixed-methods analysis of a statistically significant random sample
of 401 GitHub repositories from the PeaTMOSS dataset (28,575 repositories
reusing PTMs from Hugging Face and PyTorch Hub). We quantitatively examine PTM
reuse by identifying patterns and qualitatively investigate how developers
integrate and manage these models in practice.

Abstract: In supply chain management, decision-making often involves balancing multiple
conflicting objectives, such as cost reduction, service level improvement, and
environmental sustainability. Traditional multi-objective optimization methods,
such as linear programming and evolutionary algorithms, struggle to adapt in
real-time to the dynamic nature of supply chains. In this paper, we propose an
approach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to address these challenges for dynamic
multi-objective optimization under uncertainty. Our method leverages MOEAs to
search the parameter space of policy neural networks, generating a Pareto front
of policies. This provides decision-makers with a diverse population of
policies that can be dynamically switched based on the current system
objectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in real-time decision-making.
We also introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to incorporate
risk-sensitive decision-making, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies,
showcasing its ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in an inventory management case study. The proposed
strategy not only improves decision-making efficiency but also offers a more
robust framework for managing uncertainty and optimizing performance in supply
chains.

Abstract: To enhance the efficiency of GUI agents on various platforms like smartphones
and computers, a hybrid paradigm that combines flexible GUI operations with
efficient shortcuts (e.g., API, deep links) is emerging as a promising
direction. However, a framework for systematically benchmarking these hybrid
agents is still underexplored. To take the first step in bridging this gap, we
introduce MAS-Bench, a benchmark that pioneers the evaluation of GUI-shortcut
hybrid agents with a specific focus on the mobile domain. Beyond merely using
predefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench assesses an agent's capability to autonomously
generate shortcuts by discovering and creating reusable, low-cost workflows. It
features 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world applications, a knowledge base
of 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation
metrics. The tasks are designed to be solvable via GUI-only operations, but can
be significantly accelerated by intelligently embedding shortcuts. Experiments
show that hybrid agents achieve significantly higher success rates and
efficiency than their GUI-only counterparts. This result also demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method for evaluating an agent's shortcut generation
capabilities. MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap, providing a
foundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and

Abstract: Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents,
requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical
task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches
operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build
environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited
error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment

with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information
during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle
agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic
analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function
calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose
State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit
system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve
target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly
outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy
and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了计算效率和在线适应性问题，为扩散模型的人类偏好对齐提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning
diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However,
they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with
gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,
thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often
need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired
aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address
the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that
predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time
steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are
interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids
over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic
Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as
text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in
response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the
reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model
with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its
human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.

Abstract: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is fundamental to modern cloud computing,
enabling teams to define and manage infrastructure through machine-readable
configuration files. However, different cloud service providers utilize diverse
IaC formats. The lack of a standardized format requires cloud architects to be
proficient in multiple IaC languages, adding complexity to cloud deployment.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating IaC creation and
maintenance, progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks
across multiple IaC formats. We present Multi-IaC-Bench, a novel benchmark
dataset for evaluating LLM-based IaC generation and mutation across AWS
CloudFormation, Terraform, and Cloud Development Kit (CDK) formats. The dataset
consists of triplets containing initial IaC templates, natural language
modification requests, and corresponding updated templates, created through a
synthetic data generation pipeline with rigorous validation. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art LLMs on Multi-IaC-Bench, demonstrating that while
modern LLMs can achieve high success rates (>95%) in generating syntactically
valid IaC across formats, significant challenges remain in semantic alignment
and handling complex infrastructure patterns. Our ablation studies highlight
the importance of prompt engineering and retry mechanisms in successful IaC
generation. We release Multi-IaC-Bench to facilitate further research in

Abstract: Data scarcity continues to be a major challenge in the field of robotic

generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D
trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this
work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating
plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the
text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a
reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along
with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D
first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and
then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length
while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create
video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory.
This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion
model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic
videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly
reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate
superior visual quality compared to existing methods.

Abstract: This position paper argues that machine learning for scientific discovery
should shift from inductive pattern recognition to axiom-based reasoning. We
propose a game design framework in which scientific inquiry is recast as a
rule-evolving system: agents operate within environments governed by axioms and
modify them to explain outlier observations. Unlike conventional ML approaches
that operate within fixed assumptions, our method enables the discovery of new
theoretical structures through systematic rule adaptation. We demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach through preliminary experiments in logic-based
games, showing that agents can evolve axioms that solve previously unsolvable
problems. This framework offers a foundation for building machine learning
systems capable of creative, interpretable, and theory-driven discovery.

Abstract: In the field of software traceability link recovery (TLR), textual similarity
has long been regarded as the core criterion. However, in tasks involving
natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on
textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted
a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing
the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific
auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models:
the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based
Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach
using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case
of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and

Abstract: The rise of synthetic media has blurred the boundary between reality and
fabrication under the evolving power of artificial intelligence, fueling an
infodemic that erodes public trust in cyberspace. For digital imagery, a
multitude of editing applications further complicates the forensic analysis,
including semantic edits that alter content, photometric adjustments that
recalibrate colour characteristics, and geometric projections that reshape
viewpoints. Collectively, these transformations manipulate and control
perceptual interpretation of digital imagery. This susceptibility calls for
forensic enquiry into reconstructing the chain of events, thereby revealing
deeper evidential insight into the presence or absence of criminal intent. This
study seeks to address an inverse problem of tracing the underlying generation
chain that gives rise to the observed synthetic media. A tell-tale watermarking
system is developed for explanatory reasoning over the nature and extent of
transformations across the lifecycle of synthetic media. Tell-tale watermarks
are tailored to different classes of transformations, responding in a manner
that is neither strictly robust nor fragile but instead interpretable. These
watermarks function as reference clues that evolve under the same
transformation dynamics as the carrier media, leaving interpretable traces when

Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning has emerged as a framework combining quantum
computation with sequential decision-making, and applications to the
multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem have been reported. The graph bandit problem
extends the MAB setting by introducing spatial constraints, yet quantum
approaches remain limited. We propose a quantum algorithm for best-arm
identification in graph bandits, termed Quantum Spatial Best-Arm Identification
(QSBAI). The method employs quantum walks to encode superpositions over
graph-constrained actions, extending amplitude amplification and generalizing
the Quantum BAI algorithm via Szegedy's walk framework. This establishes a link
between Grover-type search and reinforcement learning tasks with structural
restrictions. We analyze complete and bipartite graphs, deriving the maximal
success probability of identifying the best arm and the time step at which it
is achieved. Our results highlight the potential of quantum walks to accelerate
exploration in constrained environments and extend the applicability of quantum
algorithms for decision-making.

Abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms have transformed modern experimentation by
enabling real-time adaptation for personalized treatment and efficient use of
data. Yet these advantages create challenges for statistical inference due to
adaptivity. A fundamental property that supports valid inference is policy
convergence, meaning that action-selection probabilities converge in
probability given the context. Convergence ensures replicability of adaptive
experiments and stability of online algorithms. In this paper, we highlight a
previously overlooked issue: widely used algorithms such as LinUCB may fail to
converge when the reward model is misspecified, and such non-convergence
creates fundamental obstacles for statistical inference. This issue is
practically important, as misspecified models -- such as linear approximations
of complex dynamic system -- are often employed in real-world adaptive
experiments to balance bias and variance.
  Motivated by this insight, we propose and analyze a broad class of algorithms
that are guaranteed to converge even under model misspecification. Building on
this guarantee, we develop a general inference framework based on an
inverse-probability-weighted Z-estimator (IPW-Z) and establish its asymptotic
normality with a consistent variance estimator. Simulation studies confirm that
the proposed method provides robust and data-efficient confidence intervals,
and can outperform existing approaches that exist only in the special case of
offline policy evaluation. Taken together, our results underscore the
importance of designing adaptive algorithms with built-in convergence
guarantees to enable stable experimentation and valid statistical inference in
practice.

Abstract: Traditional RL-based locomotion controllers often suffer from low data
efficiency, requiring extensive interaction to achieve robust performance. We
present a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework that improves
sample efficiency for quadrupedal locomotion by appending synthetic data to the
end of standard rollouts in PPO-based controllers, following the Dyna-Style
paradigm. A predictive model, trained alongside the policy, generates
short-horizon synthetic transitions that are gradually integrated using a
scheduling strategy based on the policy update iterations. Through an ablation
study, we identified a strong correlation between sample efficiency and rollout
length, which guided the design of our experiments. We validated our approach
in simulation on the Unitree Go1 robot and showed that replacing part of the
simulated steps with synthetic ones not only mimics extended rollouts but also
improves policy return and reduces variance. Finally, we demonstrate that this
improvement transfers to the ability to track a wide range of locomotion
commands using fewer simulated steps.

Abstract: Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable
environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical
motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full
environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural
motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop
directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or
dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural
motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic
environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is
IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million
generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further
improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher
finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at
inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We
evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving
obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,
outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both
simulated and real-world settings. Video results and code available at

Abstract: In this study, we address the multimodal task of stereo sound event
localization and detection with source distance estimation (3D SELD) in regular
video content. 3D SELD is a complex task that combines temporal event
classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning across spatial,
temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the most challenging to
model. Traditional SELD approaches typically rely on multichannel input,
limiting their capacity to benefit from large-scale pre-training due to data
constraints. To overcome this, we enhance a standard SELD architecture with
semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned
models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are
incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion,
which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. We perform an ablation study on
the development set of the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset to assess the
individual contributions of the language-aligned models and benchmark against
the DCASE Task 3 baseline systems. Additionally, we detail the curation process
of large synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets used for model pre-training.
These datasets were further expanded through left-right channel swapping
augmentation. Our approach, combining extensive pre-training, model ensembling,

Thus, transparency and responsible adoption in Human Resource Management (HRM)

subjective perception and objective understanding of explainable AI (XAI)
elements in recruiting recommender dashboards. In an online experiment, 410
German-based HR managers compared baseline dashboards to versions enriched with
three XAI styles: important features, counterfactuals, and model criteria. Our
results show that the dashboards used in practice do not explain AI results and
even keep AI elements opaque. However, while adding XAI features improves
subjective perceptions of helpfulness and trust among users with moderate or
high AI literacy, it does not increase their objective understanding. It may
even reduce accurate understanding, especially with complex explanations. Only
overlays of important features significantly aided the interpretations of
high-literacy users. Our findings highlight that the benefits of XAI in
recruitment depend on users' AI literacy, emphasizing the need for tailored

Abstract: The inherent complexity of living cells as production units creates major
challenges for maintaining stable and optimal bioprocess conditions, especially
in open Photobioreactors (PBRs) exposed to fluctuating environments. To address
this, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) control approach, combined with
Behavior Cloning (BC), for pH regulation in open PBR systems. This represents,
to the best of our knowledge, the first application of an RL-based control
strategy to such a nonlinear and disturbance-prone bioprocess. Our method
begins with an offline training stage in which the RL agent learns from
trajectories generated by a nominal Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
controller, without direct interaction with the real system. This is followed
by a daily online fine-tuning phase, enabling adaptation to evolving process
dynamics and stronger rejection of fast, transient disturbances. This hybrid
offline-online strategy allows deployment of an adaptive control policy capable
of handling the inherent nonlinearities and external perturbations in open
PBRs. Simulation studies highlight the advantages of our method: the Integral
of Absolute Error (IAE) was reduced by 8% compared to PID control and by 5%
relative to standard off-policy RL. Moreover, control effort decreased
substantially-by 54% compared to PID and 7% compared to standard RL-an
important factor for minimizing operational costs. Finally, an 8-day
experimental validation under varying environmental conditions confirmed the
robustness and reliability of the proposed approach. Overall, this work
demonstrates the potential of RL-based methods for bioprocess control and paves
the way for their broader application to other nonlinear, disturbance-prone
systems.

Abstract: Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep
learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road
networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate
representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from
neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus
on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents
MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that
integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow
heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution
to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies
scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of
road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,
MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple
scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,
which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road
network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that
MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The
performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more
from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in
complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the
most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework
for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights
distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow
heterogeneity of spatial interactions.

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty in energy management is complicated by
unknown parameters hindering optimal strategies, particularly in Battery Energy
Storage System (BESS) operations. Predict-Then-Optimise (PTO) approaches treat
forecasting and optimisation as separate processes, allowing prediction errors
to cascade into suboptimal decisions as models minimise forecasting errors
rather than optimising downstream tasks. The emerging Decision-Focused Learning
(DFL) methods overcome this limitation by integrating prediction and
optimisation; however, they are relatively new and have been tested primarily
on synthetic datasets or small-scale problems, with limited evidence of their
practical viability. Real-world BESS applications present additional
challenges, including greater variability and data scarcity due to collection
constraints and operational limitations. Because of these challenges, this work
leverages Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) to extract richer representations
and improve the nascent approach of DFL. We propose an AFE-DFL framework
suitable for small datasets that forecasts electricity prices and demand while
optimising BESS operations to minimise costs. We validate its effectiveness on
a novel real-world UK property dataset. The evaluation compares DFL methods
against PTO, with and without AFE. The results show that, on average, DFL
yields lower operating costs than PTO and adding AFE further improves the
performance of DFL methods by 22.9-56.5% compared to the same models without
AFE. These findings provide empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability in
real-world settings, indicating that domain-specific AFE enhances DFL and
reduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimisation, yielding economic
benefits with broader implications for energy management systems facing similar
challenges.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on complex perception and communication
systems, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise
safety. While simulation offers a scalable and safe environment for robustness
testing, existing frameworks typically lack comprehensive supportfor modeling
multi-domain adversarial scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, open-source
integrated simulation framework designed to generate adversarial attacks
targeting both perception and communication layers of AVs. The framework
provides high-fidelity modeling of physical environments, traffic dynamics, and
V2X networking, orchestrating these components through a unified core that
synchronizes multiple simulators based on a single configuration file. Our
implementation supports diverse perception-level attacks on LiDAR sensor data,
along with communication-level threats such as V2X message manipulation and GPS
spoofing. Furthermore, ROS 2 integration ensures seamless compatibility with
third-party AV software stacks. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by
evaluating the impact of generated adversarial scenarios on a state-of-the-art
3D object detector, revealing significant performance degradation under
realistic conditions.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in bioethical, scientific, and
medical writing remains controversial. While there is broad agreement in some
circles that LLMs cannot count as authors, there is no consensus about whether
and how humans using LLMs can count as authors. In many fields, authorship is
distributed among large teams of researchers, some of whom, including
paradigmatic senior authors who guide and determine the scope of a project and
ultimately vouch for its integrity, may not write a single word. In this paper,
we argue that LLM use (under specific conditions) is analogous to a form of
senior authorship. On this view, the use of LLMs, even to generate complete
drafts of research papers, can be considered a legitimate form of authorship
according to the accepted criteria in many fields. We conclude that either such
use should be recognized as legitimate, or current criteria for authorship
require fundamental revision. AI use declaration: GPT-5 was used to help format

Motivation: 尽管脉冲神经网络在分类任务上取得进展，但在连续运动控制领域的应用仍然有限，研究旨在探索SNN在高维连续控制任务中的可行性。

Method: 采用预测控制框架，结合Leaky Integrate-and-Fire动力学和替代梯度方法，联合优化用于动力学预测的前向模型和用于目标导向动作的策略网络。

Result: SNN能够实现稳定训练和精确的扭矩控制，在高维运动任务中表现出可行性，但循环脉冲网络对超参数设置高度敏感。

Conclusion: 虽然可以实现稳定有效的控制，但循环脉冲网络对超参数高度敏感，强调了原则性设计选择的重要性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training spiking neural networks (SNNs) for
classification, their application to continuous motor control remains limited.
Here, we demonstrate that fully spiking architectures can be trained end-to-end
to control robotic arms with multiple degrees of freedom in continuous
environments. Our predictive-control framework combines Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire dynamics with surrogate gradients, jointly optimizing a
forward model for dynamics prediction and a policy network for goal-directed
action. We evaluate this approach on both a planar 2D reaching task and a
simulated 6-DOF Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that SNNs can achieve
stable training and accurate torque control, establishing their viability for
high-dimensional motor tasks. An extensive ablation study highlights the role
of initialization, learnable time constants, and regularization in shaping
training dynamics. We conclude that while stable and effective control can be
achieved, recurrent spiking networks remain highly sensitive to hyperparameter
settings, underscoring the importance of principled design choices.

Motivation: 解决代码转换场景下自动语音识别系统难以捕捉细微音位变化的问题，特别是针对越南语-英语这种具有不同音位特征和相似声音识别模糊性的语言对。

Method: 采用两阶段音素中心架构，基于扩展的越南语音素集作为中间表示，支持音素适应和语言转换来增强代码转换语音识别性能。

Result: TSPC在越南语-英语代码转换ASR中 consistently优于现有基线方法(包括PhoWhisper-base)，词错误率显著降低至20.8%，且训练资源需求更少。

Conclusion: 音素中心的两阶段架构能有效提升复杂代码转换场景下的语音识别性能，特别是在越南语-英语这种具有挑战性的语言对中。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) presents a significant challenge for general Auto-Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems. Existing methods often fail to capture the subtle
phonological shifts inherent in CS scenarios. The challenge is particularly
difficult for language pairs like Vietnamese and English, where both distinct
phonological features and the ambiguity arising from similar sound recognition
are present. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for
Vietnamese-English CS ASR, a Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC). The TSPC
employs a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme
set as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling.
Experimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing
baselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a
significantly lower word error rate of 20.8\% with reduced training resources.
Furthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme
adaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS
Vietnamese-English ASR scenarios.

Abstract: Eye-tracking technology can aid in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders
and tracing a person's identity. However, this technology poses a significant
risk to privacy, as it captures sensitive information about individuals and
increases the likelihood that data can be traced back to them. This paper
proposes a human-centered framework designed to prevent identity backtracking
while preserving the pedagogical benefits of AI-powered eye tracking in
interactive learning environments. We explore how real-time data anonymization,
ethical design principles, and regulatory compliance (such as GDPR) can be
integrated to build trust and transparency. We first demonstrate the potential
for backtracking student IDs and diagnoses in various scenarios using serious
game-based eye-tracking data. We then provide a two-stage privacy-preserving
framework that prevents participants from being tracked while still enabling
diagnostic classification. The first phase covers four scenarios: I) Predicting
disorder diagnoses based on different game levels. II) Predicting student IDs
based on different game levels. III) Predicting student IDs based on randomized
data. IV) Utilizing K-Means for out-of-sample data. In the second phase, we
present a two-stage framework that preserves privacy. We also employ Federated
Learning (FL) across multiple clients, incorporating a secure identity
management system with dummy IDs and administrator-only access controls. In the
first phase, the proposed framework achieved 99.3% accuracy for scenario 1, 63%
accuracy for scenario 2, and 99.7% accuracy for scenario 3, successfully
identifying and assigning a new student ID in scenario 4. In phase 2, we
effectively prevented backtracking and established a secure identity management
system with dummy IDs and administrator-only access controls, achieving an
overall accuracy of 99.40%.

safety officers, or policy makers to understand and analyze threats in public
safety systems. Instead of requiring deep cybersecurity expertise, it allows
users to simply describe the components of a system they are concerned about,
such as login systems, data storage, or communication networks. Then, with the
click of a button, users can choose how they want the system to be analyzed by
using popular frameworks such as STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, CVE reports, NIST, or

but rather it acts like a knowledgeable partner. Using few-shot learning, the
AI learns from examples and generates relevant smart threat models. It can
highlight what might go wrong, how attackers could take advantage, and what can
be done to prevent harm. Whether securing a city's infrastructure or a local
health service, this tool adapts to users' needs. In simple terms, ThreatGPT
brings together AI and human judgment to make our public systems safer. It is

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个整体、可扩展的端到端EduKG自动构建管道，适用于多样化教育场景，支持学习内容的改进语义表示。

Abstract: The automatic construction of Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) is
essential for domain knowledge modeling by extracting meaningful
representations from learning materials. Despite growing interest, identifying
a scalable and reliable approach for automatic EduKG generation remains a
challenge. In an attempt to develop a unified and robust pipeline for automatic
EduKG construction, in this study we propose a pipeline for automatic EduKG
construction from PDF learning materials. The process begins with generating
slide-level EduKGs from individual pages/slides, which are then merged to form
a comprehensive EduKG representing the entire learning material. We evaluate
the accuracy of the EduKG generated from the proposed pipeline in our MOOC
platform, CourseMapper. The observed accuracy, while indicative of partial
success, is relatively low particularly in the educational context, where the
reliability of knowledge representations is critical for supporting meaningful
learning. To address this, we introduce targeted optimizations across multiple
pipeline components. The optimized pipeline achieves a 17.5% improvement in
accuracy and a tenfold increase in processing efficiency. Our approach offers a
holistic, scalable and end-to-end pipeline for automatic EduKG construction,
adaptable to diverse educational contexts, and supports improved semantic
representation of learning content.

Conclusion: 该方法为CourseMapper中的序列感知学习提供可靠支持，能够有效自动推断概念间的先修关系

Abstract: Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) organize various learning entities and
their relationships to support structured and adaptive learning. Prerequisite
relationships (PRs) are critical in EduKGs for defining the logical order in
which concepts should be learned. However, the current EduKG in the MOOC
platform CourseMapper lacks explicit PR links, and manually annotating them is
time-consuming and inconsistent. To address this, we propose an unsupervised
method for automatically inferring concept PRs without relying on labeled data.
We define ten criteria based on document-based, Wikipedia hyperlink-based,
graph-based, and text-based features, and combine them using a voting algorithm
to robustly capture PRs in educational content. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show that our approach achieves higher precision than existing methods
while maintaining scalability and adaptability, thus providing reliable support
for sequence-aware learning in CourseMapper.

Motivation: 自动音素识别系统通常使用G2P系统生成的伪音素级标注进行训练，但G2P系统经常为每个单词输出多种可能发音，而标准CTC损失无法在训练中处理这种歧义。

Method: 将图时序分类(GTC)适应到APR设置中，GTC允许从替代音素序列图中进行训练，使模型能够将每个单词的多种发音视为有效监督。

Result: 在英语和荷兰语数据集上的实验表明，将每个单词的多种发音纳入训练损失相比使用CTC训练的基线持续改善了音素错误率。

Conclusion: 将发音变异整合到损失函数中是从噪声G2P监督训练APR系统的有前景策略。

Abstract: Automatic Phoneme Recognition (APR) systems are often trained using pseudo
phoneme-level annotations generated from text through Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P)
systems. These G2P systems frequently output multiple possible pronunciations
per word, but the standard Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss
cannot account for such ambiguity during training. In this work, we adapt Graph
Temporal Classification (GTC) to the APR setting. GTC enables training from a
graph of alternative phoneme sequences, allowing the model to consider multiple
pronunciations per word as valid supervision. Our experiments on English and
Dutch data sets show that incorporating multiple pronunciations per word into
the training loss consistently improves phoneme error rates compared to a
baseline trained with CTC. These results suggest that integrating pronunciation
variation into the loss function is a promising strategy for training APR
systems from noisy G2P-based supervision.

Abstract: The enormous energy demand of artificial intelligence is driving the
development of alternative hardware for deep learning. Physical neural networks
try to exploit physical systems to perform machine learning more efficiently.
In particular, optical systems can calculate with light using negligible
energy. While their computational capabilities were long limited by the
linearity of optical materials, nonlinear computations have recently been
demonstrated through modified input encoding. Despite this breakthrough, our
inability to determine if physical neural networks can learn arbitrary
relationships between data -- a key requirement for deep learning known as
universality -- hinders further progress. Here we present a fundamental theorem
that establishes a universality condition for physical neural networks. It
provides a powerful mathematical criterion that imposes device constraints,
detailing how inputs should be encoded in the tunable parameters of the
physical system. Based on this result, we propose a scalable architecture using
free-space optics that is provably universal and achieves high accuracy on
image classification tasks. Further, by combining the theorem with temporal
multiplexing, we present a route to potentially huge effective system sizes in
highly practical but poorly scalable on-chip photonic devices. Our theorem and
scaling methods apply beyond optical systems and inform the design of a wide
class of universal, energy-efficient physical neural networks, justifying
further efforts in their development.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming public-sector processes

coupled with a data-driven approach that utilizes a survey of 203 mid- and
senior-level government employees and advanced statistical techniques (K-Means
clustering, Principal Component Analysis, and Partial Least Squares Structural
Equation Modeling). By combining policy insights with empirical evidence, the
research develops and validates a novel AI Adoption Index specifically tailored
to the GCC public sector. Findings indicate that robust infrastructure and
clear policy mandates exert the strongest influence on successful AI
implementations, overshadowing organizational readiness in early adoption
stages. The combined model explains 70% of the variance in AI outcomes,
suggesting that resource-rich environments and top-down policy directives can
drive rapid but uneven technology uptake. By consolidating key dimensions

actionable guidance for policymakers seeking to harmonize large-scale
deployments with ethical and regulatory standards. Beyond advancing academic

Motivation: 解决开放环境中多样化物体抓取的挑战，传统开环方法在杂乱环境中表现不佳，而现有闭环方法局限于简单场景和有限物体，缺乏泛化能力

Method: 在大规模合成数据集（200万条抓取轨迹）上训练视觉价值函数，结合MPC框架，加入碰撞避免和平滑执行等成本项

Result: 在仿真中抓取成功率提升32.6%，在真实世界嘈杂条件下提升33.3%，优于开环方法、扩散策略、Transformer策略和IQL方法

Conclusion: Grasp-MPC展示了在杂乱环境中对新物体的鲁棒和反应式抓取能力，为机器人抓取提供了有效的闭环解决方案

Abstract: Grasping of diverse objects in unstructured environments remains a
significant challenge. Open-loop grasping methods, effective in controlled
settings, struggle in cluttered environments. Grasp prediction errors and
object pose changes during grasping are the main causes of failure. In
contrast, closed-loop methods address these challenges in simplified settings
(e.g., single object on a table) on a limited set of objects, with no path to
generalization. We propose Grasp-MPC, a closed-loop 6-DoF vision-based grasping
policy designed for robust and reactive grasping of novel objects in cluttered
environments. Grasp-MPC incorporates a value function, trained on visual
observations from a large-scale synthetic dataset of 2 million grasp
trajectories that include successful and failed attempts. We deploy this
learned value function in an MPC framework in combination with other cost terms
that encourage collision avoidance and smooth execution. We evaluate Grasp-MPC
on FetchBench and real-world settings across diverse environments. Grasp-MPC
improves grasp success rates by up to 32.6% in simulation and 33.3% in
real-world noisy conditions, outperforming open-loop, diffusion policy,
transformer policy, and IQL approaches. Videos and more at

Motivation: 传统恶意软件分类方法中，将二进制文件转换为2D图像会导致信息丢失（量化噪声和虚假的2D依赖关系），限制了分类性能。需要一种能够保留更多原始信息的新表示方法。

Method: 将恶意软件二进制文件重新调整为1D浮点信号，避免了启发式重塑和量化噪声。开发了基于ResNet架构和squeeze-and-excitation层的定制1D卷积神经网络来分类这些信号。

Result: 在MalNet数据集上实现了最先进的性能：二进制分类F1分数0.874，类型分类0.503，家族分类0.507。

Conclusion: 1D信号表示比传统2D图像方法更有效，为未来恶意软件分类模型提供了新的信号模态处理方式。

Abstract: Malware classification is a contemporary and ongoing challenge in
cyber-security: modern obfuscation techniques are able to evade traditional
static analysis, while dynamic analysis is too resource intensive to be
deployed at a large scale. One prominent line of research addresses these
limitations by converting malware binaries into 2D images by heuristically
reshaping them into a 2D grid before resizing using Lanczos resampling. These
images can then be classified based on their textural information using
computer vision approaches. While this approach can detect obfuscated malware
more effectively than static analysis, the process of converting files into 2D
images results in significant information loss due to both quantisation noise,
caused by rounding to integer pixel values, and the introduction of 2D
dependencies which do not exist in the original data. This loss of signal
limits the classification performance of the downstream model. This work
addresses these weaknesses by instead resizing the files into 1D signals which
avoids the need for heuristic reshaping, and additionally these signals do not
suffer from quantisation noise due to being stored in a floating-point format.
It is shown that existing 2D CNN architectures can be readily adapted to
classify these 1D signals for improved performance. Furthermore, a bespoke 1D
convolutional neural network, based on the ResNet architecture and
squeeze-and-excitation layers, was developed to classify these signals and
evaluated on the MalNet dataset. It was found to achieve state-of-the-art
performance on binary, type, and family level classification with F1 scores of
0.874, 0.503, and 0.507, respectively, paving the way for future models to
operate on the proposed signal modality.

Motivation: 解决现有音频合成方法在合成质量和推理效率之间的固有权衡问题，特别是基于流匹配的模型需要迭代采样过程导致推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 引入MeanFlow加速模型，使用平均速度表征流场，实现一步生成；采用标量重缩放机制平衡条件和非条件预测，缓解CFG引起的失真；联合训练多模态条件的音频合成网络。

Result: 实验结果表明，MeanFlow显著提高了推理速度，同时在VTA和TTA合成任务上不损害感知质量。

Conclusion: MeanFlow方法有效解决了音频合成中的效率瓶颈问题，实现了高质量的一步生成。

Abstract: A key challenge in synthesizing audios from silent videos is the inherent
trade-off between synthesis quality and inference efficiency in existing
methods. For instance, flow matching based models rely on modeling
instantaneous velocity, inherently require an iterative sampling process,
leading to slow inference speeds. To address this efficiency bottleneck, we
introduce a MeanFlow-accelerated model that characterizes flow fields using
average velocity, enabling one-step generation and thereby significantly
accelerating multimodal video-to-audio (VTA) synthesis while preserving audio
quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Furthermore, a
scalar rescaling mechanism is employed to balance conditional and unconditional
predictions when classifier-free guidance (CFG) is applied, effectively
mitigating CFG-induced distortions in one step generation. Since the audio
synthesis network is jointly trained with multimodal conditions, we further
evaluate it on text-to-audio (TTA) synthesis task. Experimental results
demonstrate that incorporating MeanFlow into the network significantly improves
inference speed without compromising perceptual quality on both VTA and TTA
synthesis tasks.

Abstract: The EU AI Act provides a rulebook for all AI systems being put on the market
or into service in the European Union. This article investigates the
requirement under the AI Act that Member States establish national AI
regulatory sandboxes for testing and validation of innovative AI systems under
regulatory supervision to assist with fostering innovation and complying with
regulatory requirements. Against the backdrop of the EU objective that AI
regulatory sandboxes would both foster innovation and assist with compliance,
considerable challenges are identified for Member States around
capacity-building and design of regulatory sandboxes. While Member States are
early movers in laying the ground for national AI regulatory sandboxes, the
article contends that there is a risk that differing approaches being taken by
individual national sandboxes could jeopardise a uniform interpretation of the
AI Act and its application in practice. This could motivate innovators to play
sandbox arbitrage. The article therefore argues that the European Commission
and the AI Board need to act decisively in developing rules and guidance to
ensure a cohesive, coordinated approach in national AI regulatory sandboxes.
With sandbox participation being voluntary, the possibility that AI regulatory
sandboxes may prove unattractive to innovators on their compliance journey is
also explored. Confidentiality concerns, the inability to relax legal rules
during the sandbox, and the inability of sandboxes to deliver a presumption of
conformity with the AI Act are identified as pertinent concerns for innovators
contemplating applying to AI regulatory sandboxes as compared with other direct
compliance routes provided to them through application of harmonised standards
and conformity assessment procedures.

Conclusion: 双流处理机制能有效捕捉不同分辨率特征，在手术场景分割任务中表现出色，为手术训练提供了更好的场景理解能力

Abstract: The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep
learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough
understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic
segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on
surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level
contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive
Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple
levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level
Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream,
for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and
surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark
datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model
achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy
segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU
of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation,
respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class
SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for
anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing

Abstract: Modern zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) systems, essential for privacy and
verifiable computation, suffer from a fundamental limitation: the prover
typically uses memory that scales linearly with the computation's trace length
T, making them impractical for resource-constrained devices and prohibitively
expensive for large-scale tasks. This paper overcomes this barrier by
constructing, to our knowledge, the first sublinear-space ZKP prover. Our core
contribution is an equivalence that reframes proof generation as an instance of
the classic Tree Evaluation problem. Leveraging a recent space-efficient
tree-evaluation algorithm, we design a streaming prover that assembles the
proof without ever materializing the full execution trace. The approach reduces
prover memory from linear in T to O(sqrt(T)) (up to O(log T) lower-order terms)
while preserving proof size, verifier time, and the transcript/security
guarantees of the underlying system. This enables a shift from specialized,
server-bound proving to on-device proving, opening applications in
decentralized systems, on-device machine learning, and privacy-preserving
technologies.

Abstract: Residential buildings contribute significantly to energy use, health
outcomes, and carbon emissions. In New Zealand, housing quality has
historically been poor, with inadequate insulation and inefficient heating
contributing to widespread energy hardship. Recent reforms, including the
Warmer Kiwi Homes program, Healthy Homes Standards, and H1 Building Code
upgrades, have delivered health and comfort improvements, yet challenges
persist. Many retrofits remain partial, data on household performance are
limited, and decision-making support for homeowners is fragmented. This study
presents the design and evaluation of an AI-powered decision-support tool for
residential energy efficiency in New Zealand. The prototype, developed using
Python and Streamlit, integrates data ingestion, anomaly detection, baseline
modeling, and scenario simulation (e.g., LED retrofits, insulation upgrades)
into a modular dashboard. Fifteen domain experts, including building
scientists, consultants, and policy practitioners, tested the tool through
semi-structured interviews. Results show strong usability (M = 4.3), high value
of scenario outputs (M = 4.5), and positive perceptions of its potential to
complement subsidy programs and regulatory frameworks. The tool demonstrates
how AI can translate national policies into personalized, household-level
guidance, bridging the gap between funding, standards, and practical
decision-making. Its significance lies in offering a replicable framework for
reducing energy hardship, improving health outcomes, and supporting climate
goals. Future development should focus on carbon metrics, tariff modeling,
integration with national datasets, and longitudinal trials to assess
real-world adoption.

Abstract: Autonomous regolith excavation is a cornerstone of in-situ resource
utilization for a sustained human presence beyond Earth. However, this task is
fundamentally hindered by the complex interaction dynamics of granular media
and the operational need for robots to use diverse tools. To address these
challenges, this work introduces a framework where a model-based reinforcement
learning agent learns within a parallelized simulation. This environment
leverages high-fidelity particle physics and procedural generation to create a
vast distribution of both lunar terrains and excavation tool geometries. To
master this diversity, the agent learns an adaptive interaction strategy by
dynamically modulating its own stiffness and damping at each control step
through operational space control. Our experiments demonstrate that training
with a procedural distribution of tools is critical for generalization and
enables the development of sophisticated tool-aware behavior. Furthermore, we
show that augmenting the agent with visual feedback significantly improves task
success. These results represent a validated methodology for developing the
robust and versatile autonomous systems required for the foundational tasks of
future space missions.

Abstract: Autonomous microrobots in blood vessels could enable minimally invasive
therapies, but navigation is challenged by dense, moving obstacles. We propose
a real-time path planning framework that couples an analytic geometry global
planner (AGP) with two reactive local escape controllers, one based on rules
and one based on reinforcement learning, to handle sudden moving obstacles.
Using real-time imaging, the system estimates the positions of the microrobot,
obstacles, and targets and computes collision-free motions. In simulation, AGP
yields shorter paths and faster planning than weighted A* (WA*), particle swarm
optimization (PSO), and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), while maintaining
feasibility and determinism. We extend AGP from 2D to 3D without loss of speed.
In both simulations and experiments, the combined global planner and local
controllers reliably avoid moving obstacles and reach targets. The average
planning time is 40 ms per frame, compatible with 25 fps image acquisition and
real-time closed-loop control. These results advance autonomous microrobot
navigation and targeted drug delivery in vascular environments.

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) attacks have resulted in significant losses,
often orchestrated through Adversarial Exploiter Contracts (AECs) that exploit
vulnerabilities in victim smart contracts. To proactively identify such
threats, this paper targets the explainable detection of AECs.
  Existing detection methods struggle to capture semantic dependencies and lack
interpretability, limiting their effectiveness and leaving critical knowledge
gaps in AEC analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce SEASONED, an
effective, self-explanatory, and robust framework for AEC detection.
  SEASONED extracts semantic information from contract bytecode to construct a
semantic relation graph (SRG), and employs a self-counterfactual explainable
detector (SCFED) to classify SRGs and generate explanations that highlight the
core attack logic. SCFED further enhances robustness, generalizability, and
data efficiency by extracting representative information from these
explanations. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of SEASONED, which showcases outstanding detection
performance, robustness, generalizability, and data efficiency learning
ability. To support further research, we also release a new dataset of 359
AECs.

Abstract: Modeling and simulation of High Power Microwave (HPM) breakdown, a multiscale
phenomenon, is computationally expensive and requires solving Maxwell's
equations (EM solver) coupled with a plasma continuity equation (plasma
solver). In this work, we present a hybrid modeling approach that combines the
accuracy of a differential equation-based plasma fluid solver with the
computational efficiency of FNO (Fourier Neural Operator) based EM solver.
Trained on data from an in-house FDTD-based plasma-fluid solver, the FNO
replaces computationally expensive EM field updates, while the plasma solver
governs the dynamic plasma response. The hybrid model is validated on microwave
streamer formation, due to diffusion ionization mechanism, in a 2D scenario for
unseen incident electric fields corresponding to entirely new plasma streamer
simulations not included in model training, showing excellent agreement with
FDTD based fluid simulations in terms of streamer shape, velocity, and temporal
evolution. This hybrid FNO based strategy delivers significant acceleration of
the order of 60X compared to traditional simulations for the specified problem
size and offers an efficient alternative for computationally demanding
multiscale and multiphysics simulations involved in HPM breakdown. Our work
also demonstrate how such hybrid pipelines can be used to seamlessly to
integrate existing C-based simulation codes with Python-based machine learning
frameworks for simulations of plasma science and engineering problems.

Conclusion: 该架构利用固有高并行性和全光编码方法，推动了高维光子计算系统在超高分辨率、高通量应用中的发展

Abstract: Diffractive neural networks leverage the high-dimensional characteristics of
electromagnetic (EM) fields for high-throughput computing. However, the
existing architectures face challenges in integrating large-scale
multidimensional metasurfaces with precise network training and haven't
utilized multidimensional EM field coding scheme for super-resolution sensing.
Here, we propose diffractive meta-neural networks (DMNNs) for accurate EM field
modulation through metasurfaces, which enable multidimensional multiplexing and
coding for multi-task learning and high-throughput super-resolution direction
of arrival estimation. DMNN integrates pre-trained mini-metanets to
characterize the amplitude and phase responses of meta-atoms across different
polarizations and frequencies, with structure parameters inversely designed
using the gradient-based meta-training. For wide-field super-resolution angle
estimation, the system simultaneously resolves azimuthal and elevational angles
through x and y-polarization channels, while the interleaving of
frequency-multiplexed angular intervals generates spectral-encoded optical
super-oscillations to achieve full-angle high-resolution estimation.
Post-processing lightweight electronic neural networks further enhance the
performance. Experimental results validate that a three-layer DMNN operating at
27 GHz, 29 GHz, and 31 GHz achieves $\sim7\times$ Rayleigh diffraction-limited
angular resolution (0.5$^\circ$), a mean absolute error of 0.048$^\circ$ for
two incoherent targets within a $\pm 11.5^\circ$ field of view, and an angular
estimation throughput an order of magnitude higher (1917) than that of existing
methods. The proposed architecture advances high-dimensional photonic computing
systems by utilizing inherent high-parallelism and all-optical coding methods
for ultra-high-resolution, high-throughput applications.

Abstract: Interfacing quantum and classical processors is an important subroutine in
full-stack quantum algorithms. The so-called "classical shadow" method
efficiently extracts essential classical information from quantum states,
enabling the prediction of many properties of a quantum system from only a few
measurements. However, for a small number of highly non-local observables, or
when classical post-processing power is limited, the classical shadow method is
not always the most efficient choice. Here, we address this issue
quantitatively by performing a full-stack resource analysis that compares
classical shadows with ``quantum footage," which refers to direct quantum
measurement. Under certain assumptions, our analysis illustrates a boundary of
download efficiency between classical shadows and quantum footage. For
observables expressed as linear combinations of Pauli matrices, the classical
shadow method outperforms direct measurement when the number of observables is
large and the Pauli weight is small. For observables in the form of large
Hermitian sparse matrices, the classical shadow method shows an advantage when
the number of observables, the sparsity of the matrix, and the number of qubits
fall within a certain range. The key parameters influencing this behavior
include the number of qubits $n$, observables $M$, sparsity $k$, Pauli weight
$w$, accuracy requirement $\epsilon$, and failure tolerance $\delta$. We also
compare the resource consumption of the two methods on different types of
quantum computers and identify break-even points where the classical shadow
method becomes more efficient, which vary depending on the hardware. This paper
opens a new avenue for quantitatively designing optimal strategies for hybrid
quantum-classical tomography and provides practical insights for selecting the
most suitable quantum measurement approach in real-world applications.

Abstract: The accurate long-term forecasting of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
is still one of the biggest challenges in climate science. While it is true
that short-to medium-range performance has been improved significantly using
the advances in deep learning, statistical dynamical hybrids, most operational
systems still use the simple mean of all ensemble members, implicitly assuming
equal skill across members. In this study, we demonstrate, through a strictly
a-posteriori evaluation , for any large enough ensemble of ENSO forecasts,
there is a subset of members whose skill is substantially higher than that of
the ensemble mean. Using a state-of-the-art ENSO forecast system
cross-validated against the 1986-2017 observed Nino3.4 index, we identify two
Top-5 subsets one ranked on lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and another on
highest Pearson correlation. Generally across all leads, these outstanding
members show higher correlation and lower RMSE, with the advantage rising
enormously with lead time. Whereas at short leads (1 month) raises the mean
correlation by about +0.02 (+1.7%) and lowers the RMSE by around 0.14 {\deg}C
or by 23.3% compared to the All-40 mean, at extreme leads (23 months) the
correlation is raised by +0.43 (+172%) and RMSE by 0.18 {\deg}C or by 22.5%
decrease. The enhancements are largest during crucial ENSO transition periods
such as SON and DJF, when accurate amplitude and phase forecasting is of
greatest socio-economic benefit, and furthermore season-dependent e.g.,
mid-year months such as JJA and MJJ have incredibly large RMSE reductions. This
study provides a solid foundation for further investigations to identify
reliable clues for detecting high-quality ensemble members, thereby enhancing
forecasting skill.

Abstract: Timed regular expressions serve as a formalism for specifying real-time
behaviors of Cyber-Physical Systems. In this paper, we consider the synthesis
of timed regular expressions, focusing on generating a timed regular expression
consistent with a given set of system behaviors including positive and negative
examples, i.e., accepting all positive examples and rejecting all negative
examples. We first prove the decidability of the synthesis problem through an
exploration of simple timed regular expressions. Subsequently, we propose our
method of generating a consistent timed regular expression with minimal length,
which unfolds in two steps. The first step is to enumerate and prune candidate
parametric timed regular expressions. In the second step, we encode the
requirement that a candidate generated by the first step is consistent with the
given set into a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formula, which is
consequently solved to determine a solution to parametric time constraints.
Finally, we evaluate our approach on benchmarks, including randomly generated
behaviors from target timed models and a case study.

Abstract: Computational models are critical to advance our understanding of how neural,
biomechanical, and physical systems interact to orchestrate animal behaviors.
Despite the availability of near-complete reconstructions of the Drosophila
melanogaster central nervous system, musculature, and exoskeleton, anatomically
and physically grounded models of fly leg muscles are still missing. These
models provide an indispensable bridge between motor neuron activity and joint
movements. Here, we introduce the first 3D, data-driven musculoskeletal model
of Drosophila legs, implemented in both OpenSim and MuJoCo simulation
environments. Our model incorporates a Hill-type muscle representation based on
high-resolution X-ray scans from multiple fixed specimens. We present a
pipeline for constructing muscle models using morphological imaging data and
for optimizing unknown muscle parameters specific to the fly. We then combine
our musculoskeletal models with detailed 3D pose estimation data from behaving
flies to achieve muscle-actuated behavioral replay in OpenSim. Simulations of
muscle activity across diverse walking and grooming behaviors predict
coordinated muscle synergies that can be tested experimentally. Furthermore, by
training imitation learning policies in MuJoCo, we test the effect of different
passive joint properties on learning speed and find that damping and stiffness
facilitate learning. Overall, our model enables the investigation of motor
control in an experimentally tractable model organism, providing insights into
how biomechanics contribute to generation of complex limb movements. Moreover,
our model can be used to control embodied artificial agents to generate
naturalistic and compliant locomotion in simulated environments.

Estimation Problem approach which allows, to automatically compute exact

several available performance guarantees are very conservative, sometimes by

Moreover, at least in terms of worst-case performance, some algorithms appear
not to benefit from inter-agent communications for a significant period of
time. We show how to improve classical methods by tuning their step-sizes, and
find that we can save up to 20% on their actual worst-case performance regret.

Abstract: Detection and tracking are the basic tasks of radar systems. Current joint
detection tracking methods, which focus on dynamically adjusting detection
thresholds from tracking results, still present challenges in fully utilizing
the potential of radar signals. These are mainly reflected in the limited
capacity of the constant false-alarm rate model to accurately represent
information, the insufficient depiction of complex scenes, and the limited
information acquired by the tracker. We introduce the Integrated Detection and
Tracking based on radar feature (InDT) method, which comprises a network
architecture for radar signal detection and a tracker that leverages detection
assistance. The InDT detector extracts feature information from each
Range-Doppler (RD) matrix and then returns the target position through the
feature enhancement module and the detection head. The InDT tracker adaptively
updates the measurement noise covariance of the Kalman filter based on
detection confidence. The similarity of target RD features is measured by
cosine distance, which enhances the data association process by combining
location and feature information. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method
was validated through testing on both simulated data and publicly available
datasets.

Abstract: A conventional LLM Unlearning setting consists of two subsets -"forget" and
"retain", with the objectives of removing the undesired knowledge from the
forget set while preserving the remaining knowledge from the retain. In
privacy-focused unlearning research, a retain set is often further divided into
neighbor sets, containing either directly or indirectly connected to the forget
targets; and augmented by a general-knowledge set. A common practice in
existing benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general
knowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and
relationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic
iteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto
standards have not been critically examined. In this study, we systematically
evaluate these common practices. Our findings reveal that relying on a single
neighbor set is suboptimal and that a standard sampling approach can obscure
performance trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we propose and validate an
initial set of best practices: (1) Incorporation of diverse neighbor sets to
balance forget efficacy and model utility, (2) Standard 1:1 sampling methods
are inefficient and yield poor results, (3) Our proposed Modular Entity-Level
Unlearning (MELU) strategy as an alternative to cyclic sampling. We demonstrate
that this modular approach, combined with robust algorithms, provides a clear
and stable path towards effective unlearning.

Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID)
performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a
pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this,
most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights,
features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve
OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD
robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input
information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor
proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we
propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and
pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming
to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further
enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an
additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of
perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could
consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD
robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing
regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: 提出自对齐奖励(SAR)方法，通过相对困惑度差异来同时提升LLM推理的准确性和效率，在保持准确性的同时减少30%推理成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可验证奖励信号过于粗糙（只有二元正确性反馈），导致推理过程冗长、计算成本高，且现有解决方案往往牺牲准确性

Method: SAR定义为答案在查询条件下与独立答案的相对困惑度差异，偏好简洁且查询特定的响应。与PPO、GRPO等RL算法结合使用

Result: 在4个模型和7个基准测试中，SAR将准确率提高4%，推理成本降低30%，在正确性和效率之间实现帕累托最优权衡

Conclusion: SAR作为可验证奖励的细粒度补充，能够在不丢失关键推理的情况下抑制不必要的阐述，为更高效的LLM训练铺平道路

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but such signals remain coarse,
offering only binary correctness feedback. This limitation often results in
inefficiencies, including overly verbose reasoning and high computational cost,
while existing solutions often compromise accuracy. To address this, we
introduce self-aligned reward (SAR), a self-guided signal that complements
verifiable rewards to encourage both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. SAR is
defined as the relative perplexity difference between an answer conditioned on
the query and the standalone answer, thereby favoring responses that are
concise and query-specific. Quantitative analysis reveals that SAR reliably
distinguishes answer quality: concise, correct answers score higher than
redundant ones, and partially correct answers score higher than entirely
incorrect ones. Evaluation on 4 models across 7 benchmarks shows that
integrating SAR with prevalent RL algorithms like PPO and GRPO improves
accuracy by 4%, while reducing inference cost by 30%. Further analysis
demonstrates that SAR achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between correctness
and efficiency compared to reward signals based on length or self-confidence.
We also show that SAR shortens responses while preserving advanced reasoning
behaviors, demonstrating its ability to suppress unnecessary elaboration
without losing critical reasoning. These results highlight the promise of
self-aligned reward as a fine-grained complement to verifiable rewards, paving
the way for more efficient and effective LLM training.

Motivation: 基础模型面临日益增长的计算和内存瓶颈，阻碍了在资源受限平台上的部署。现有的压缩技术大多采用统一启发式方法，忽略了架构和运行时异质性。

Method: 使用大型语言模型构建模块化多智能体系统，分析静态指标（MACs、参数量）和动态信号（延迟、内存）来设计特定架构的剪枝和量化策略。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，剪枝保持竞争力或提升精度（ImageNet-1K约1%下降，ViT-B/16在小数据集上提升2%），量化实现高达74%内存节省和<0.5%精度损失，推理速度提升1.74倍。

Conclusion: 智能体系统可作为可扩展的解决方案，用于基于性能分析的模型优化，LLM推理质量对迭代剪枝至关重要。

Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering
deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as
pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that
ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose
per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into
automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic
approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via
structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular
multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and
dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.
Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with
ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive
or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on
smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with
<0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups
of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo
highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These
results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided
model optimization.

We survey five major generative model families: autoregressive models,

emphasizes the distinction between density estimation and generation. We review
a game-theoretic framework with a two-player adversary-learner setup to study
generation. We discuss post-training modifications that prepare generative
models for deployment. We end by highlighting some important topics in socially

generation is as a machine learning problem, rather than only on how models

Abstract: Routing incoming queries to the most cost-effective LLM while maintaining
response quality poses a fundamental challenge in optimizing performance-cost
trade-offs for large-scale commercial systems. We present IPR\, a
quality-constrained Intelligent Prompt Routing framework that dynamically
selects optimal models based on predicted response quality and user-specified
tolerance levels. IPR introduces three key innovations: (1) a modular
architecture with lightweight quality estimators trained on 1.5M prompts
annotated with calibrated quality scores, enabling fine-grained quality
prediction across model families; (2) a user-controlled routing mechanism with
tolerance parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$ that provides explicit control over
quality-cost trade-offs; and (3) an extensible design using frozen encoders
with model-specific adapters, reducing new model integration from days to
hours. To rigorously train and evaluate IPR, we curate an industrial-level
dataset IPRBench\footnote{IPRBench will be released upon legal approval.}, a
comprehensive benchmark containing 1.5 million examples with response quality
annotations across 11 LLM candidates. Deployed on a major cloud platform, IPR
achieves 43.9\% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型系列上验证，LoaQ在权重量化和权重激活联合量化中表现有效，能进一步提升整体量化质量

Conclusion: LoaQ方法更好地符合量化直觉，有潜力推动后训练量化技术前沿发展

Abstract: A natural and intuitive idea in model quantization is to approximate each
component's quantized output to match its original. Layer-wise post-training
quantization (PTQ), though based on this idea, adopts a strictly local view and
can achieve, at best, only activation-aware approximations of weights. As a
result, it often leads to insufficient approximations and practical deviations
from this guiding intuition. Recent work has achieved a more accurate
approximation of linear-layer outputs within the framework of layer-wise PTQ,
but such refinements remain inadequate for achieving alignment with the full
model output. Based on a deeper understanding of the structural characteristics
of mainstream LLMs, we propose $LoaQ$, an output-approximation method for
layer-wise PTQ that explicitly targets output-level consistency. It better
aligns with this intuition and can feature a simple closed-form solution,
making it orthogonal to existing techniques and readily integrable into
existing quantization pipelines. Experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen model
families demonstrate that LoaQ performs effectively in both weight-only and
weight-activation joint quantization. By integrating seamlessly with existing
quantization strategies, it further enhances overall quantization quality and
shows strong potential to advance the frontier of post-training quantization.

Conclusion: LLMs展现出强大的数值数据处理能力，其上下文学习遵循可预测的神经缩放规律，为理解LLMs内部处理机制提供了新视角

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent in-context learning
(ICL) capabilities across a range of tasks, including zero-shot time-series
forecasting. We show that text-trained foundation models can accurately
extrapolate spatiotemporal dynamics from discretized partial differential
equation (PDE) solutions without fine-tuning or natural language prompting.
Predictive accuracy improves with longer temporal contexts but degrades at
finer spatial discretizations. In multi-step rollouts, where the model
recursively predicts future spatial states over multiple time steps, errors
grow algebraically with the time horizon, reminiscent of global error
accumulation in classical finite-difference solvers. We interpret these trends
as in-context neural scaling laws, where prediction quality varies predictably
with both context length and output length. To better understand how LLMs are
able to internally process PDE solutions so as to accurately roll them out, we
analyze token-level output distributions and uncover a consistent ICL
progression: beginning with syntactic pattern imitation, transitioning through
an exploratory high-entropy phase, and culminating in confident, numerically
grounded predictions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent
capabilities, yet the robustness of their numerical reasoning remains an open
question. While standard benchmarks evaluate LLM reasoning on complex problem
sets using aggregated metrics, they often obscure foundational weaknesses. In
this work, we probe LLM mathematical numeracy by evaluating performance on
problems of escalating complexity, from constituent operations to combinatorial
puzzles. We test several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem
challenge comprising four categories: (1) basic arithmetic, (2) advanced
operations, (3) primality checking, and (4) the Game of 24 number puzzle. Our
results show that while the agents achieved high accuracy on the first three
categories, which require deterministic algorithmic execution, they
consistently failed at the number puzzle, underlining its demand for a
heuristic search over a large combinatorial space to be a significant
bottleneck. These findings reveal that the agents' proficiency is largely
confined to recalling and executing known algorithms, rather than performing
generative problem-solving. This suggests their apparent numerical reasoning is
more akin to sophisticated pattern-matching than flexible, analytical thought,
limiting their potential for tasks that require novel or creative numerical

Conclusion: Ban&Pick无需重新训练或架构修改即可为MoE-LLM带来免费性能提升和推理加速，证明了后训练路由优化的重要性。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a key architecture for scaling
large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Recent fine-grained MoE designs
introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per
token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers
are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely
and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance
and efficiency. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few
highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced
routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per
token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or
redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&Pick, a post-training,
plug-and-play strategy for smarter MoE routing. Pick discovers and reinforces
key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to
notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban complements this by dynamically
pruning redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering
faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained
MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that Ban&Pick delivers free performance gains and inference
acceleration without retraining or architectural changes. For instance, on
Qwen3-30B-A3B, it improves accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from
65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, while accelerating inference by 1.25x under the

Abstract: The mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes language-model
computations remain poorly understood. We study lightweight steering vectors
inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a
reinforcement-learning objective, which can match full fine-tuning performance
while retaining the interpretability of small, additive interventions. Using
logit-lens readouts, path patching, and circuit analyses, we analyze two models
and find: (i) the last-layer steering vector behaves like a token-substitution
bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens
such as "To" and "Step"; and (ii) the penultimate-layer steering vector leaves
attention patterns largely unchanged and instead acts through the MLP and
unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols.
These results establish a principled framework for interpreting the behavioral
changes induced by reasoning training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL,
which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields
substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation
diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is
critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL
post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce
effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our
study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,
where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and
(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a
limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose
outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final
outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,
which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch
exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time
diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models
demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity
collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based
exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these
contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning
without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.

Abstract: We develop a theory of intelligent agency grounded in probabilistic modeling
for neural models. Agents are represented as outcome distributions with
epistemic utility given by log score, and compositions are defined through
weighted logarithmic pooling that strictly improves every member's welfare. We
prove that strict unanimity is impossible under linear pooling or in binary
outcome spaces, but possible with three or more outcomes. Our framework admits
recursive structure via cloning invariance, continuity, and openness, while
tilt-based analysis rules out trivial duplication. Finally, we formalize an
agentic alignment phenomenon in LLMs using our theory: eliciting a benevolent
persona ("Luigi'") induces an antagonistic counterpart ("Waluigi"), while a
manifest-then-suppress Waluigi strategy yields strictly larger first-order
misalignment reduction than pure Luigi reinforcement alone. These results
clarify how developing a principled mathematical framework for how subagents
can coalesce into coherent higher-level entities provides novel implications
for alignment in agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or multimodal large language models
represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, enabling
systems to understand and generate content across both visual and textual
modalities. While large-scale pretraining has driven substantial progress,
fine-tuning these models for aligning with human values or engaging in specific
tasks or behaviors remains a critical challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offer promising frameworks for
this aligning process. While DRL enables models to optimize actions using
reward signals instead of relying solely on supervised preference data, DPO
directly aligns the policy with preferences, eliminating the need for an
explicit reward model. This overview explores paradigms for fine-tuning LVLMs,
highlighting how DRL and DPO techniques can be used to align models with human
preferences and values, improve task performance, and enable adaptive
multimodal interaction. We categorize key approaches, examine sources of
preference data, reward signals, and discuss open challenges such as
scalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety.
The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how DRL and DPO contribute to
the evolution of robust and human-aligned LVLMs.

AI capabilities and lagging safety progress. Existing paradigms divide into
``Make AI Safe'', which applies post-hoc alignment and guardrails but remains
brittle and reactive, and ``Make Safe AI'', which emphasizes intrinsic safety
but struggles to address unforeseen risks in open-ended environments. We
therefore propose \textit{safe-by-coevolution} as a new formulation of the
``Make Safe AI'' paradigm, inspired by biological immunity, in which safety
becomes a dynamic, adversarial, and ongoing learning process. To operationalize
this vision, we introduce \texttt{R$^2$AI} -- \textit{Resistant and Resilient
AI} -- as a practical framework that unites resistance against known threats
with resilience to unforeseen risks. \texttt{R$^2$AI} integrates \textit{fast
and slow safe models}, adversarial simulation and verification through a
\textit{safety wind tunnel}, and continual feedback loops that guide safety and
capability to coevolve. We argue that this framework offers a scalable and
proactive path to maintain continual safety in dynamic environments, addressing
both near-term vulnerabilities and long-term existential risks as AI advances
toward AGI and ASI.

Conclusion: 通过实例级实时难度调整，SEELE能够有效对齐问题难度与模型能力演化，显著提升强化学习训练的探索效率

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable
success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration
inefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the
model's capability. LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems
are overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are
too simple. In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by
quantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy.
Building on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR
framework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the
high-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint
(part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous
hint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint
length for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the
optimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In
each round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs
collected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next
round. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem
difficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration
efficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5
points, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided
approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI系统在科学、商业和政府领域的普及，理解其失败模式（如幻觉）对于高风险应用中的信任和采用至关重要。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器捕获概念表示，在输入空间具有实验控制不确定性的场景下，系统分析预训练Transformer模型中幻觉的产生机制。

Result: 研究发现随着输入信息变得非结构化，模型使用的语义概念数量增加；在纯噪声输入下，中间激活中识别出多种有意义的概念；幻觉输出可以从Transformer层激活中的概念模式可靠预测。

Abstract: As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science,
business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an
acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity
of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI
solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when
hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept
representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with
experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic
experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer
model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the
face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes
prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to
hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide
variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate
activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we
confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the
output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept
patterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights
on transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for
aligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for
potential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic
quantification of a model's hallucination risk.

Abstract: Motivated by the need for rigorous and scalable evaluation of large language
models, we study contextual preference inference for pairwise comparison
functionals of context-dependent preference score functions across domains.
Focusing on the contextual Bradley-Terry-Luce model, we develop a
semiparametric efficient estimator that automates the debiased estimation
through aggregating weighted residual balancing terms across the comparison
graph. We show that the efficiency is achieved when the weights are derived
from a novel strategy called Fisher random walk. We also propose a
computationally feasible method to compute the weights by a potential
representation of nuisance weight functions. We show our inference procedure is
valid for general score function estimators accommodating the practitioners'
need to implement flexible deep learning methods. We extend the procedure to
multiple hypothesis testing using a Gaussian multiplier bootstrap that controls
familywise error and to distributional shift via a cross-fitted
importance-sampling adjustment for target-domain inference. Numerical studies,
including language model evaluations under diverse contexts, corroborate the
accuracy, efficiency, and practical utility of our method.

Motivation: 量化LLM虽然能提高吞吐量和减少内存使用，但存在KV块大小较小导致内存碎片化的问题，且量化与非量化模型的资源使用模式不同，需要高效的调度机制来最大化吞吐量。

Conclusion: FineServe通过精确感知的内存管理和自适应调度，有效解决了混合精度LLM推理服务中的内存碎片和资源调度问题，显著提升了服务效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques have
significantly increased demand for serving quantized large language models
(LLMs), enabling higher throughput and substantially reduced memory usage with
minimal accuracy loss. Quantized models address memory constraints in LLMs and
enhance GPU resource utilization through efficient GPU sharing. However,
quantized models have smaller KV block sizes than non-quantized models, causing
limited memory efficiency due to memory fragmentation. Also, distinct resource
usage patterns between quantized and non-quantized models require efficient
scheduling to maximize throughput. To address these challenges, we propose
FineServe, an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs. FineServe's
key contributions include: (1) KV Slab, a precision-aware adaptive memory
management technique dynamically allocating KV cache based on model
quantization characteristics, significantly reducing GPU memory fragmentation,
and (2) a two-level scheduling framework comprising a global scheduler that
places models to GPUs based on request rates, latency SLOs, and memory
constraints and efficiency, and a local scheduler that adaptively adjusts batch
sizes according to real-time request fluctuations. Experimental results
demonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x
higher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing
systems.

Conclusion: 揭示了LLM部署安全的关键疏忽，强调未来LLM防御策略中迫切需要嵌入层完整性检查

Abstract: The widespread distribution of Large Language Models (LLMs) through public
platforms like Hugging Face introduces significant security challenges. While
these platforms perform basic security scans, they often fail to detect subtle
manipulations within the embedding layer. This work identifies a novel class of
deployment phase attacks that exploit this vulnerability by injecting
imperceptible perturbations directly into the embedding layer outputs without
modifying model weights or input text. These perturbations, though
statistically benign, systematically bypass safety alignment mechanisms and
induce harmful behaviors during inference. We propose Search based Embedding
Poisoning(SEP), a practical, model agnostic framework that introduces carefully
optimized perturbations into embeddings associated with high risk tokens. SEP
leverages a predictable linear transition in model responses, from refusal to
harmful output to semantic deviation to identify a narrow perturbation window
that evades alignment safeguards. Evaluated across six aligned LLMs, SEP
achieves an average attack success rate of 96.43% while preserving benign task
performance and evading conventional detection mechanisms. Our findings reveal
a critical oversight in deployment security and emphasize the urgent need for
embedding level integrity checks in future LLM defense strategies.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) reveal whether specific data was used to
train machine learning models, serving as important tools for privacy auditing
and compliance assessment. Recent studies have reported that MIAs perform only
marginally better than random guessing against large language models,
suggesting that modern pre-training approaches with massive datasets may be
free from privacy leakage risks. Our work offers a complementary perspective to
these findings by exploring how examining LLMs' internal representations,
rather than just their outputs, may provide additional insights into potential
membership inference signals. Our framework, \emph{memTrace}, follows what we
call \enquote{neural breadcrumbs} extracting informative signals from
transformer hidden states and attention patterns as they process candidate
sequences. By analyzing layer-wise representation dynamics, attention
distribution characteristics, and cross-layer transition patterns, we detect
potential memorization fingerprints that traditional loss-based approaches may
not capture. This approach yields strong membership detection across several
model families achieving average AUC scores of 0.85 on popular MIA benchmarks.
Our findings suggest that internal model behaviors can reveal aspects of
training data exposure even when output-based signals appear protected,
highlighting the need for further research into membership privacy and the
development of more robust privacy-preserving training techniques for large
language models.

Abstract: Data collection is crucial for learning robust world models in model-based
reinforcement learning. The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect
trajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or
training on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning
task-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for
effective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on
world models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been
thoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both
paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different
environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline
counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of
offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This
issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,
offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between
the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We
demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online
interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of
online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that
incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of
offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data
when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on
expert data alone.

Conclusion: DCV-ROOD框架为OOD检测模型提供了可靠的评估方法，能够有效整合ID和OOD数据并考虑其不同特性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a key role in enhancing the
robustness of artificial intelligence systems by identifying inputs that differ
significantly from the training distribution, thereby preventing unreliable
predictions and enabling appropriate fallback mechanisms. Developing reliable
OOD detection methods is a significant challenge, and rigorous evaluation of
these techniques is essential for ensuring their effectiveness, as it allows
researchers to assess their performance under diverse conditions and to
identify potential limitations or failure modes. Cross-validation (CV) has
proven to be a highly effective tool for providing a reasonable estimate of the
performance of a learning algorithm. Although OOD scenarios exhibit particular
characteristics, an appropriate adaptation of CV can lead to a suitable
evaluation framework for this setting. This work proposes a dual CV framework
for robust evaluation of OOD detection models, aimed at improving the
reliability of their assessment. The proposed evaluation framework aims to
effectively integrate in-distribution (ID) and OOD data while accounting for
their differing characteristics. To achieve this, ID data are partitioned using
a conventional approach, whereas OOD data are divided by grouping samples based
on their classes. Furthermore, we analyze the context of data with class
hierarchy to propose a data splitting that considers the entire class hierarchy
to obtain fair ID-OOD partitions to apply the proposed evaluation framework.
This framework is called Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution
Detection (DCV-ROOD). To test the validity of the evaluation framework, we
selected a set of state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, both with and without
outlier exposure. The results show that the method achieves very fast
convergence to the true performance.

Abstract: While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine
patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as
market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be
leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To
investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal
intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments
of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period)
during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts:
injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm
semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we
find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent
vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks.
Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and
Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically
grounded representations are a robust property of large time series
transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that
governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution
to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for
strategic stress-testing.

Abstract: With Large Language Models' (LLMs) emergent abilities on code generation

Despite the strong results of multiple recent LLM-based Text-to-SQL frameworks,

information for generating high-quality SQL queries. We find that such schema
information plays a significant or even dominant role in the Text-to-SQL task.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel database schema expert with two
components. We first introduce X-Linking, an LLM Supervised Finetuning
(SFT)-based method that achieves superior Schema Linking results compared to
existing open-source Text-to-SQL methods. In addition, we innovatively propose
an X-Admin component that focuses on Schema Understanding by bridging the gap
between abstract schema information and the user's natural language question.
Aside from better learning with schema information, we experiment with
Multi-LLMs for different components within the system to further boost its
performance. By incorporating these techniques into our end-to-end framework,
X-SQL, we have achieved Execution Accuracies of 84.9% on the Spider-Dev dataset
and 82.5% on the Spider-Test dataset. This outstanding performance establishes
X-SQL as the leading Text-to-SQL framework based on open-source models.

Method: 采用复合标记化原则，将每个多属性事件视为单个语义连贯单元，学习用户行为的底层"语法"，感知完整交互而非离散数据流

Result: 该架构不仅更准确，而且代表了创建更适应性和智能预测系统的根本性进步

Conclusion: UIFM是真正行为理解的基础模型，能够更好地理解复杂演化的事件序列

Abstract: A central goal of artificial intelligence is to build systems that can
understand and predict complex, evolving sequences of events. However, current
foundation models, designed for natural language, fail to grasp the holistic
nature of structured interactions found in domains like telecommunications,
e-commerce and finance. By serializing events into text, they disassemble them
into semantically fragmented parts, losing critical context. In this work, we
introduce the Unified Interaction Foundation Model (UIFM), a foundation model
engineered for genuine behavioral understanding. At its core is the principle
of composite tokenization, where each multi-attribute event is treated as a
single, semantically coherent unit. This allows UIFM to learn the underlying
"grammar" of user behavior, perceiving entire interactions rather than a
disconnected stream of data points. We demonstrate that this architecture is
not just more accurate, but represents a fundamental step towards creating more
adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.

TL;DR: PolicyEvolve是一个多智能体强化学习框架，利用LLMs生成可解释的程序化策略，通过迭代进化过程减少对环境交互的依赖，提高策略性能和可解释性。

Motivation: 传统MARL方法需要大量计算资源和样本，且策略缺乏可解释性，限制了实际部署。受LLMs在单智能体任务中成功生成程序化策略的启发，希望将其扩展到多玩家游戏中。

Method: 提出四模块框架：全局池保存精英策略，局部池存储临时策略，策略规划器作为核心生成模块，轨迹批评器分析交互数据并提出改进方向。通过迭代采样、生成、精炼策略的过程。

Result: 显著减少了对人工编写策略代码的依赖，以最少的环境交互实现了高性能策略，提高了策略的可解释性和执行效率。

Conclusion: PolicyEvolve为多玩家游戏中的程序化策略生成提供了一个通用框架，结合了LLMs的优势和进化算法，在性能和可解释性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant progress
in solving complex multi-player games through self-play. However, training
effective adversarial policies requires millions of experience samples and
substantial computational resources. Moreover, these policies lack
interpretability, hindering their practical deployment. Recently, researchers
have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
programmatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based
policies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.
Inspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating
programmatic policies in multi-player games. PolicyEvolve significantly reduces
reliance on manually crafted policy code, achieving high-performance policies
with minimal environmental interactions. The framework comprises four modules:
Global Pool, Local Pool, Policy Planner, and Trajectory Critic. The Global Pool
preserves elite policies accumulated during iterative training. The Local Pool
stores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently
high-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The
Policy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top
three policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the
current iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy
using feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited
into the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves
a sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it
is integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction
data from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes
directional improvements to guide the Policy Planner

Conclusion: 跨视图对齐的必要性得到验证，门控融合优于后期融合和纯LLM变体，语言模型在冷/长尾场景占主导，图结构在其他场景稳定排序

Abstract: Personalization is a core capability across consumer technologies, streaming,
shopping, wearables, and voice, yet it remains challenged by sparse
interactions, fast content churn, and heterogeneous textual signals. We present
RecMind, an LLM-enhanced graph recommender that treats the language model as a
preference prior rather than a monolithic ranker. A frozen LLM equipped with
lightweight adapters produces text-conditioned user/item embeddings from
titles, attributes, and reviews; a LightGCN backbone learns collaborative
embeddings from the user-item graph. We align the two views with a symmetric
contrastive objective and fuse them via intra-layer gating, allowing language
to dominate in cold/long-tail regimes and graph structure to stabilize rankings
elsewhere. On Yelp and Amazon-Electronics, RecMind attains the best results on
all eight reported metrics, with relative improvements up to +4.53\%
(Recall@40) and +4.01\% (NDCG@40) over strong baselines. Ablations confirm both
the necessity of cross-view alignment and the advantage of gating over late

Conclusion: 该框架作为催化剂加速MCP生态系统发展，通过高度自动化方式解决LLM工具集成难题，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a significant
integration challenge in the AI agent ecosystem, often called the "$N \times M$
problem," where N models require custom integrations for M tools. This
fragmentation stifles innovation and creates substantial development overhead.
While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard to resolve
this, its adoption is hindered by the manual effort required to convert the
vast universe of existing software into MCP-compliant services. This is
especially true for the millions of open-source repositories on GitHub, the
world's largest collection of functional code. This paper introduces Code2MCP,
a highly automated, agentic framework designed to transform any GitHub
repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Our
system employs a multi-stage workflow that automates the entire process, from
code analysis and environment configuration to service generation and
deployment. A key innovation of our framework is an LLM-driven, closed-loop
"Run--Review--Fix" cycle, which enables the system to autonomously debug and
repair the code it generates. Code2MCP produces not only deployable services
but also comprehensive technical documentation, acting as a catalyst to
accelerate the MCP ecosystem by systematically unlocking the world's largest
open-source code repository and automating the critical last mile of tool
integration. The code is open-sourced at

Conclusion: 该方法为NAS提供了一种有效的端到端优化解决方案，通过空间重构实现了高效的梯度搜索，在多个领域和任务中展现出优异性能

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a hard computationally expensive
optimization problem with a discrete, vast, and spiky search space. One of the
key research efforts dedicated to this space focuses on accelerating NAS via
certain proxy evaluations of neural architectures. Different from the prevalent
predictor-based methods using surrogate models and differentiable architecture
search via supernetworks, we propose an optimization proxy to streamline the
NAS as an end-to-end optimization framework, named OptiProxy-NAS. In
particular, using a proxy representation, the NAS space is reformulated to be
continuous, differentiable, and smooth. Thereby, any differentiable
optimization method can be applied to the gradient-based search of the relaxed
architecture parameters. Our comprehensive experiments on $12$ NAS tasks of $4$
search spaces across three different domains including computer vision, natural
language processing, and resource-constrained NAS fully demonstrate the
superior search results and efficiency. Further experiments on low-fidelity
scenarios verify the flexibility.

Conclusion: SimPEL能够有效弥合模拟到现实的差距，在复杂现实环境中实现数据高效学习和控制。

Abstract: How do we enable AI systems to efficiently learn in the real-world?
First-principles models are widely used to simulate natural systems, but often
fail to capture real-world complexity due to simplifying assumptions. In
contrast, deep learning approaches can estimate complex dynamics with minimal
assumptions but require large, representative datasets. We propose SimPEL, a
method that efficiently combines first-principles models with data-driven
learning by using low-fidelity simulators as priors in Bayesian deep learning.
This enables SimPEL to benefit from simulator knowledge in low-data regimes and
leverage deep learning's flexibility when more data is available, all the while
carefully quantifying epistemic uncertainty. We evaluate SimPEL on diverse
systems, including biological, agricultural, and robotic domains, showing
superior performance in learning complex dynamics. For decision-making, we
demonstrate that SimPEL bridges the sim-to-real gap in model-based
reinforcement learning. On a high-speed RC car task, SimPEL learns a highly
dynamic parking maneuver involving drifting with substantially less data than
state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the potential of SimPEL for
data-efficient learning and control in complex real-world environments.

Conclusion: 在更现实的假设下扩展了AMOO的理论基础，为多任务学习提供了更实用的优化框架。

Abstract: It is widely recognized in modern machine learning practice that access to a
diverse set of tasks can enhance performance across those tasks. This
observation suggests that, unlike in general multi-objective optimization, the
objectives in many real-world settings may not be inherently conflicting. To
address this, prior work introduced the Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization
(AMOO) framework and proposed gradient-based algorithms with provable
convergence guarantees. However, existing analysis relies on strong
assumptions, particularly strong convexity, which implies the existence of a
unique optimal solution. In this work, we relax this assumption and study
gradient-descent algorithms for convex AMOO under standard smoothness or
Lipschitz continuity conditions-assumptions more consistent with those used in
deep learning practice. This generalization requires new analytical tools and
metrics to characterize convergence in the convex AMOO setting. We develop such
tools, propose scalable algorithms for convex AMOO, and establish their
convergence guarantees. Additionally, we prove a novel lower bound that
demonstrates the suboptimality of naive equal-weight approaches compared to our
methods.

Abstract: Accurate risk assessment in lung cancer screening is critical for enabling
early cancer detection and minimizing unnecessary invasive procedures. The Lung
CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) has been widely used as the
standard framework for patient management and follow-up. Nevertheless,
Lung-RADS faces trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, as it
stratifies risk solely based on lung nodule characteristics without
incorporating various risk factors. Here we propose a reasoning language model
(RLM) to integrate radiology findings with longitudinal medical records for
individualized lung cancer risk assessment. Through a systematic study
including dataset construction and distillation, supervised fine-tuning,
reinforcement learning, and comprehensive evaluation, our model makes
significant improvements in risk prediction performance on datasets in the
national lung screening trial. Notably, RLM can decompose the risk evaluation
task into sub-components, analyze the contributions of diverse risk factors,
and synthesize them into a final risk score computed using our data-driven
system equation. Our approach improves both predictive accuracy and
monitorability through the chain of thought reasoning process, thereby
facilitating clinical translation into lung cancer screening.

Motivation: 深度网络经常产生冗余的潜在空间，多个坐标编码重叠信息，降低了有效容量并阻碍泛化。标准指标如准确率或重构损失只能提供间接证据，无法直接隔离冗余问题。

Method: 引入冗余指数rho(C)，通过分析从潜在表示导出的耦合矩阵，并通过能量距离将其离对角线统计量与正态分布进行比较。

Result: 在MNIST变体、Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上的实验验证表明，低rho(C)可靠地预测高分类准确率或低重构误差，而高冗余与性能崩溃相关。

Conclusion: rho(C)提供了一个理论视角和实用工具，用于评估和改进学习表示的效率，可以指导神经架构搜索并作为冗余感知的正则化目标。

Abstract: A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent
embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks
often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode
overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering
generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss
provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a
failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly
quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices
derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics
against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,
interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.
We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST
variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple
architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low
rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction
error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.
Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower
bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen
Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)
can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware
regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across
models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool
for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time
device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data
distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The
prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,

knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter
changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and
recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and

highlight four interconnected challenges: community dysfunction, research
priorities misaligned with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and
infrastructure inequities. We argue that their roots lie in cultural and
organizational practices. Addressing them requires not only technical
innovation but also intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary
education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for

Conclusion: HAO和TBFact为分子肿瘤委员会提供了可靠且可扩展的支持基础，解决了医疗摘要生成和评估的关键挑战。

Abstract: Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) are multidisciplinary forums where oncology
specialists collaboratively assess complex patient cases to determine optimal
treatment strategies. A central element of this process is the patient summary,
typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon,
or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records
into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is
often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical
information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent
Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that
coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and
comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient
summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic
variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate
the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these
evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework
designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated
summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board
discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results
show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including
partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict
entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free
evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing
sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation
for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs.

denoising step-by-step in diffusion models. This enables models to learn
complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we
investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD)
methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value
functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq
(flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function
using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching,
typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow
is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced
by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical
integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling
of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately
setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline
RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly
1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures,
highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.

Method: 将词操作学习问题重构为学习特定的3-张量，分析其低秩特性。通过分解到群的基本自共轭表示三元组，利用融合结构排除冗余组件。研究网络在梯度下降下找到低秩实现的过程。

Result: 证明简单两层网络能够学习任意有限群中的词操作，并表现出grokking。网络通过低秩实现来近似词张量，在简单乘法词的情况下实现了类似Strassen矩阵乘法的效率。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够发现并利用数学结构中的低秩特性来实现高效的代数运算，这解释了grokking现象并揭示了网络学习复杂数学运算的内在机制。

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a simple two-layer neural network with
standard activation functions can learn an arbitrary word operation in any
finite group, provided sufficient width is available and exhibits grokking
while doing so. To explain the mechanism by which this is achieved, we reframe
the problem as that of learning a particular $3$-tensor, which we show is
typically of low rank. A key insight is that low-rank implementations of this
tensor can be obtained by decomposing it along triplets of basic self-conjugate
representations of the group and leveraging the fusion structure to rule out
many components. Focusing on a phenomenologically similar but more tractable
surrogate model, we show that the network is able to find such low-rank
implementations (or approximations thereof), thereby using limited width to
approximate the word-tensor in a generalizable way. In the case of the simple
multiplication word, we further elucidate the form of these low-rank
implementations, showing that the network effectively implements efficient
matrix multiplication in the sense of Strassen. Our work also sheds light on
the mechanism by which a network reaches such a solution under gradient
descent.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in 6G vehicular networks
promises unprecedented advancements in intelligent transportation systems.
However, offloading LLM computations from vehicles to edge infrastructure poses
significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive user data. This paper
presents a novel privacy-preserving offloading framework for LLM-integrated
vehicular networks. We introduce a hybrid approach combining federated learning
(FL) and differential privacy (DP) techniques to protect user data while
maintaining LLM performance. Our framework includes a privacy-aware task
partitioning algorithm that optimizes the trade-off between local and edge
computation, considering both privacy constraints and system efficiency. We
also propose a secure communication protocol for transmitting model updates and
aggregating results across the network. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach achieves 75\% global accuracy with only a 2-3\% reduction compared
to non-privacy-preserving methods, while maintaining DP guarantees with an
optimal privacy budget of $\varepsilon = 0.8$. The framework shows stable
communication overhead of approximately 2.1MB per round with computation
comprising over 90\% of total processing time, validating its efficiency for
resource-constrained vehicular environments.

Conclusion: 这项工作为AI反歧视案件中的LDA证明提供了实用的技术工具，降低了原告的举证门槛，有助于促进AI系统的公平性和问责制。

Abstract: AI audits play a critical role in AI accountability and safety. One branch of
the law for which AI audits are particularly salient is anti-discrimination
law. Several areas of anti-discrimination law implicate the "less
discriminatory alternative" (LDA) requirement, in which a protocol (e.g.,
model) is defensible if no less discriminatory protocol that achieves
comparable performance can be found with a reasonable amount of effort.
Notably, the burden of proving an LDA exists typically falls on the claimant
(the party alleging discrimination). This creates a significant hurdle in AI
cases, as the claimant would seemingly need to train a less discriminatory yet
high-performing model, a task requiring resources and expertise beyond most
litigants. Moreover, developers often shield information about and access to
their model and training data as trade secrets, making it difficult to
reproduce a similar model from scratch.
  In this work, we present a procedure enabling claimants to determine if an
LDA exists, even when they have limited compute, data, information, and model
access. We focus on the setting in which fairness is given by demographic
parity and performance by binary cross-entropy loss. As our main result, we
provide a novel closed-form upper bound for the loss-fairness Pareto frontier
(PF). We show how the claimant can use it to fit a PF in the "low-resource
regime," then extrapolate the PF that applies to the (large) model being
contested, all without training a single large model. The expression thus
serves as a scaling law for loss-fairness PFs. To use this scaling law, the
claimant would require a small subsample of the train/test data. Then, the
claimant can fit the context-specific PF by training as few as 7 (small)
models. We stress test our main result in simulations, finding that our scaling
law holds even when the exact conditions of our theory do not.

Abstract: Network log data analysis plays a critical role in detecting security threats
and operational anomalies. Traditional log analysis methods for anomaly
detection and root cause analysis rely heavily on expert knowledge or fully
supervised learning models, both of which require extensive labeled data and
significant human effort. To address these challenges, we propose ALPHA, the
first Active Learning Pipeline for Human-free log Analysis. ALPHA integrates
semantic embedding, clustering-based representative sampling, and large
language model (LLM)-assisted few-shot annotation to automate the anomaly
detection process. The LLM annotated labels are propagated across clusters,
enabling large-scale training of an anomaly detector with minimal supervision.
To enhance the annotation accuracy, we propose a two-step few-shot refinement
strategy that adaptively selects informative prompts based on the LLM's
observed error patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world log datasets
demonstrate that ALPHA achieves detection accuracy comparable to fully
supervised methods while mitigating human efforts in the loop. ALPHA also
supports interpretable analysis through LLM-driven root cause explanations in
the post-detection stage. These capabilities make ALPHA a scalable and
cost-efficient solution for truly automated log-based anomaly detection.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of training data distribution on the
performance of image classification models. By analyzing the embeddings of the
training set, we propose a framework to understand the confidence of model
predictions on unseen data without the need for retraining. Our approach
filters out low-confidence predictions based on their distance from the
training distribution in the embedding space, significantly improving
classification accuracy. We demonstrate this on the example of several
classification models, showing consistent performance gains across
architectures. Furthermore, we show that using multiple embedding models to
represent the training data enables a more robust estimation of confidence, as
different embeddings capture complementary aspects of the data. Combining these
embeddings allows for better detection and exclusion of out-of-distribution
samples, resulting in further accuracy improvements. The proposed method is
model-agnostic and generalizable, with potential applications beyond computer
vision, including domains such as Natural Language Processing where prediction
reliability is critical.

Abstract: Solving long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks remains a significant challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)
addresses this by decomposing tasks into more manageable sub-tasks, but the
automatic discovery of the hierarchy and the joint training of multi-level
policies often suffer from instability and can lack theoretical guarantees. In
this paper, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation (RLA), a
principled and potentially scalable framework designed to address these
limitations. The RLA agent learns two synergistic models: a low-level,
goal-conditioned policy that learns to reach specified subgoals, and a
high-level anticipation model that functions as a planner, proposing
intermediate subgoals on the optimal path to a final goal. The key feature of
RLA is the training of the anticipation model, which is guided by a principle
of value geometric consistency, regularized to prevent degenerate solutions. We
present proofs that RLA approaches the globally optimal policy under various
conditions, establishing a principled and convergent method for hierarchical
planning and execution in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task,
particularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal
dependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate
the lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training
discriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer
from two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly
knowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and
Anomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too
closely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting
classification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable
anomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a
CutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted
manner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision
strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly
shift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional
network to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and
ESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated
training data. The code is available at https://github.com/alsike22/CAPMix.

Abstract: Targeted data poisoning attacks pose an increasingly serious threat due to
their ease of deployment and high success rates. These attacks aim to
manipulate the prediction for a single test sample in classification models.
Unlike indiscriminate attacks that aim to decrease overall test performance,
targeted attacks present a unique threat to individual test instances. This
threat model raises a fundamental question: what factors make certain test
samples more susceptible to successful poisoning than others? We investigate
how attack difficulty varies across different test instances and identify key
characteristics that influence vulnerability. This paper introduces three
predictive criteria for targeted data poisoning difficulty: ergodic prediction
accuracy (analyzed through clean training dynamics), poison distance, and
poison budget. Our experimental results demonstrate that these metrics
effectively predict the varying difficulty of real-world targeted poisoning
attacks across diverse scenarios, offering practitioners valuable insights for
vulnerability assessment and understanding data poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have emerged as a principled framework
for auditing the privacy of synthetic data generated by tabular generative
models, where many diverse methods have been proposed that each exploit
different privacy leakage signals. However, in realistic threat scenarios, an
adversary must choose a single method without a priori guarantee that it will
be the empirically highest performing option. We study this challenge as a
decision theoretic problem under uncertainty and conduct the largest synthetic
data privacy benchmark to date. Here, we find that no MIA constitutes a
strictly dominant strategy across a wide variety of model architectures and
dataset domains under our threat model. Motivated by these findings, we propose
ensemble MIAs and show that unsupervised ensembles built on individual attacks
offer empirically more robust, regret-minimizing strategies than individual
attacks.

Abstract: Modern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple
robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although
individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation,
scheduling, and motion planning under spatio-temporal constraints remain
computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales.
Existing multi-arm systems deployed in the industry rely on human intuition and
experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive
process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an
obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a
shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our
approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on
procedurally-generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot
configurations, and task distributions. It employs a graph representation of
scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through reinforcement learning
to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the sub-problems
of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly
generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen
settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We
further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its
use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and
scalability of our planner also open the door to new capabilities such as
fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based re-planning, where rapid
adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.

Conclusion: 基于熵的动态路由策略是简单有效的解决方案，能够平衡对话推荐系统中的探索和利用

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems promise rich interactions for e-commerce,
but balancing exploration (clarifying user needs) and exploitation (making
recommendations) remains challenging, especially when deploying large language
models (LLMs) with vast product catalogs. We address this challenge by modeling
the breadth of user interest via the entropy of retrieval score distributions.
Our method uses a neural retriever to fetch relevant items for a user query and
computes the entropy of the re-ranked scores to dynamically route the dialogue
policy: low-entropy (specific) queries trigger direct recommendations, whereas
high-entropy (ambiguous) queries prompt exploratory questions. This simple yet
effective strategy allows an LLM-driven agent to remain aware of an arbitrarily
large catalog in real-time without bloating its context window.

Conclusion: 高效的目标导向学习依赖于将复杂目标信息压缩为稳定的奖励函数，这一发现为人类动机的认知机制提供了新见解，对内在动机神经科学和行为技术改进有重要意义。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents learn from rewards, but humans can uniquely
assign value to novel, abstract outcomes in a goal-dependent manner. However,
this flexibility is cognitively costly, making learning less efficient. Here,
we propose that goal-dependent learning is initially supported by a
capacity-limited working memory system. With consistent experience, learners
create a "compressed" reward function (a simplified rule defining the goal)
which is then transferred to long-term memory and applied automatically upon
receiving feedback. This process frees up working memory resources, boosting
learning efficiency. We test this theory across six experiments. Consistent
with our predictions, our findings demonstrate that learning is parametrically
impaired by the size of the goal space, but improves when the goal space
structure allows for compression. We also find faster reward processing to
correlate with better learning performance, supporting the idea that as goal
valuation becomes more automatic, more resources are available for learning. We
leverage computational modeling to support this interpretation. Our work
suggests that efficient goal-directed learning relies on compressing complex
goal information into a stable reward function, shedding light on the cognitive
mechanisms of human motivation. These findings generate new insights into the
neuroscience of intrinsic motivation and could help improve behavioral
techniques that support people in achieving their goals.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了标签噪声下的OOD检测问题，为安全关键AI系统提供了更可靠的异常检测能力。

Abstract: Robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an indispensable component of
modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, especially in safety-critical
applications where models must identify inputs from unfamiliar classes not seen
during training. While OOD detection has been extensively studied in the
machine learning literature--with both post hoc and training-based
approaches--its effectiveness under noisy training labels remains
underexplored. Recent studies suggest that label noise can significantly
degrade OOD performance, yet principled solutions to this issue are lacking. In
this work, we demonstrate that directly combining existing label noise-robust
methods with OOD detection strategies is insufficient to address this critical
challenge. To overcome this, we propose a robust OOD detection framework that
integrates loss correction techniques from the noisy label learning literature
with low-rank and sparse decomposition methods from signal processing.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art OOD detection
techniques, particularly under severe noisy label settings.

Abstract: The rise of model-sharing through frameworks and dedicated hubs makes Machine
Learning significantly more accessible. Despite their benefits, these tools
expose users to underexplored security risks, while security awareness remains
limited among both practitioners and developers. To enable a more
security-conscious culture in Machine Learning model sharing, in this paper we
evaluate the security posture of frameworks and hubs, assess whether
security-oriented mechanisms offer real protection, and survey how users
perceive the security narratives surrounding model sharing. Our evaluation
shows that most frameworks and hubs address security risks partially at best,
often by shifting responsibility to the user. More concerningly, our analysis
of frameworks advertising security-oriented settings and complete model sharing
uncovered six 0-day vulnerabilities enabling arbitrary code execution. Through
this analysis, we debunk the misconceptions that the model-sharing problem is
largely solved and that its security can be guaranteed by the file format used
for sharing. As expected, our survey shows that the surrounding security
narrative leads users to consider security-oriented settings as trustworthy,
despite the weaknesses shown in this work. From this, we derive takeaways and
suggestions to strengthen the security of model-sharing ecosystems.

Method: 提出拓扑推理攻击(TIAs)来评估GNN的拓扑隐私风险；开发PGR防御框架，通过双层优化问题迭代生成合成训练图并使用元梯度更新GNN模型。

Result: 实验表明GNN对拓扑推理攻击高度脆弱，现有边级差分隐私机制不足；PGR能显著减少拓扑信息泄露且对模型精度影响最小。

Conclusion: 拓扑隐私是GNN中一个重要但被忽视的安全问题，PGR提供了有效的防御解决方案，在保护隐私的同时保持了模型实用性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning
from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised
serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on
edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology
privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work,
we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing
their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a
suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure
of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our
findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that
existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they
either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To
address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a
novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining
model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a
synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the
GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with
minimal impact on model accuracy. Our code is anonymously available at

music, making it challenging to deliver a balanced and personalized content
mix. Moreover, users' preference towards different content types may vary
depending on the time of day, the day of week, or even the device they use. We
propose a calibration method that leverages contextual bandits to dynamically
learn each user's optimal content type distribution based on their context and
preferences. Unlike traditional calibration methods that rely on historical
averages, our approach boosts engagement by adapting to how users interests in
different content types varies across contexts. Both offline and online results
demonstrate improved precision and user engagement with the Spotify Home page,
in particular with under-represented content types such as podcasts.

Conclusion: PLanTS通过显式建模不规则潜在状态及其转换，有效解决了多元时间序列表示学习中的周期性建模和动态演化捕捉问题。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) are ubiquitous in domains such as healthcare,
climate science, and industrial monitoring, but their high dimensionality,
limited labeled data, and non-stationary nature pose significant challenges for
conventional machine learning methods. While recent self-supervised learning
(SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time
point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure
of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose
PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly
models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a
period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive
loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across
multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design
a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to
encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS
across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label
classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS
consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and
demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.

Abstract: Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous
clinical data into unified patient representations to support predictive
modeling, which remains an essential yet challenging task in the medical data
mining community. However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from
missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints.
Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available
observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically
neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself.
In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization:
missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality
availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that
influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we
perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose
a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based
multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a
missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on
backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly
disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our
method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness and causal insights.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains
challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled
examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning
approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network
latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses
privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still
has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and
differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal
Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse
sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple
accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through
residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via
attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused
embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy
safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that
the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with
up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and
federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed
under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses
MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on
the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of
graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to
the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.

Abstract: Despite the notable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in solving complex
tasks, the training process still remains considerable challenges. A primary
obstacle is the substantial time required for training, particularly as high
performing DNNs tend to become increasingly deep (characterized by a larger
number of hidden layers) and require extensive training datasets. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a distributed training method that
integrates two prominent strategies for accelerating deep learning: data
parallelism and fully decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm. By
utilizing multiple computational units operating in parallel, the proposed
approach enhances the amount of training data processed in each iteration while
mitigating locking issues commonly associated with the backpropagation
algorithm. These features collectively contribute to significant improvements
in training efficiency. The proposed distributed training method is rigorously
proven to converge to critical points under certain conditions. Its
effectiveness is further demonstrated through empirical evaluations, wherein an
DNN is trained to perform classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Conclusion: 共形预测虽然能提供更高的真实类别覆盖率，但在捕捉偶然不确定性方面的能力有限，需要重新评估其预测集的有效性

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction
sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction
set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of
evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction
set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are
larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of
this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how
effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically
the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform
this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number
of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess
the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use
three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight
deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations
from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per
instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast
majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak
correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate
correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing
the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can
provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing
aleatoric uncertainty remains limited.

Abstract: While queueing network models are powerful tools for analyzing service
systems, they traditionally require substantial human effort and domain
expertise to construct. To make this modeling approach more scalable and
accessible, we propose a data-driven framework for queueing network modeling
and simulation based on autoregressive sequence models trained on event-stream
data. Instead of explicitly specifying arrival processes, service mechanisms,
or routing logic, our approach learns the conditional distributions of event
types and event times, recasting the modeling task as a problem of sequence
distribution learning. We show that Transformer-style architectures can
effectively parameterize these distributions, enabling automated construction
of high-fidelity simulators. As a proof of concept, we validate our framework
on event tables generated from diverse queueing networks, showcasing its
utility in simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactual
evaluation. Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence and the growing
availability of data, our framework takes a step toward more automated,
data-driven modeling pipelines to support broader adoption of queueing network
models across service domains.

harmful data, machine unlearning seeks to modify trained models so that they
effectively ``forget'' designated data. A key challenge in verifying unlearning
is forging -- adversarially crafting data that mimics the gradient of a target
point, thereby creating the appearance of unlearning without actually removing
information. To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data
points whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance
$\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a
framework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural
networks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small. It scales on
the order of $\epsilon$, and when $\epsilon$ is small enough, $\epsilon^d$.
More generally, under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that the forging
set measure decays as $\epsilon^{(d-r)/2}$, where $d$ is the data dimension and
$r<d$ is the nullity of a variation matrix defined by the model gradients.
Extensions to batch SGD and almost-everywhere smooth loss functions yield the
same asymptotic scaling. In addition, we establish probability bounds showing
that, under non-degenerate data distributions, the likelihood of randomly
sampling a forging point is vanishingly small. These results provide evidence
that adversarial forging is fundamentally limited and that false unlearning
claims can, in principle, be detected.

Conclusion: SOOTT框架为在线决策提供了新视角，BEST和CoRT算法在实际工作负载调度中展现出良好的性能平衡

Abstract: We introduce the Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking (SOOTT)
problem, a new framework that integrates three key objectives in online
decision-making under uncertainty: (1) tracking cost for following a
dynamically moving target, (2) adversarial perturbation cost for withstanding
unpredictable disturbances, and (3) switching cost for penalizing abrupt
changes in decisions. This formulation captures real-world scenarios such as
elastic and inelastic workload scheduling in AI clusters, where operators must
balance long-term service-level agreements (e.g., LLM training) against sudden
demand spikes (e.g., real-time inference). We first present BEST, a robust
algorithm with provable competitive guarantees for SOOTT. To enhance practical
performance, we introduce CoRT, a learning-augmented variant that incorporates
untrusted black-box predictions (e.g., from ML models) into its decision
process. Our theoretical analysis shows that CoRT strictly improves over BEST
when predictions are accurate, while maintaining robustness under arbitrary
prediction errors. We validate our approach through a case study on workload
scheduling, demonstrating that both algorithms effectively balance trajectory
tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to external disturbances.

Abstract: Time-inconsistent preferences, where agents favor smaller-sooner over

Quasi-Hyperbolic (QH) discounting provides a simple yet powerful model for this

precommitted agents with QH preferences. We make two primary contributions: (i)
we formally characterize the structure of the optimal policy, proving for the
first time that it reduces to a simple one-step non-stationary form; and (ii)
we design the first practical, model-free algorithms for both policy evaluation

Motivation: 神经算子(Neural Operators)需要大量训练数据且在数据稀缺时表现不佳，许多现有方法没有明确编码物理演化的因果性和时间局部性结构。自回归模型虽然保持因果性但存在误差累积问题。

Method: 采用图神经网络模拟器(GNS)框架，结合消息传递图神经网络和显式数值时间步进方案，通过建模瞬时时间导数来学习PDE解。引入了PCA+KMeans轨迹选择策略来提升低数据性能。

Result: 在三个典型PDE系统上，GNS仅使用3%的训练数据(30个样本)就能实现低于1%的相对L2误差，相比FNO和DeepONet等基线方法显著提高了数据效率。GNS将自回归误差平均降低了82.48%(相对FNO AR)和99.86%(相对DON AR)。

Conclusion: 将基于图的局部归纳偏置与传统时间积分器相结合，可以产生准确、物理一致且可扩展的时变PDE代理模型。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional
function spaces but require large datasets and struggle with scarce training
data. Many NO formulations don't explicitly encode causal, local-in-time
structure of physical evolution. While autoregressive models preserve causality
by predicting next time-steps, they suffer from rapid error accumulation. We
employ Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) - a message-passing graph neural network
framework - with explicit numerical time-stepping schemes to construct accurate
forward models that learn PDE solutions by modeling instantaneous time
derivatives. We evaluate our framework on three canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D
Burgers' scalar equation, (2) 2D coupled Burgers' vector equation, and (3) 2D
Allen-Cahn equation. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate GNS significantly
improves data efficiency, achieving higher generalization accuracy with
substantially fewer training trajectories compared to neural operator baselines
like DeepONet and FNO. GNS consistently achieves under 1% relative L2 errors
with only 30 training samples out of 1000 (3% of available data) across all
three PDE systems. It substantially reduces error accumulation over extended
temporal horizons: averaged across all cases, GNS reduces autoregressive error
by 82.48% relative to FNO AR and 99.86% relative to DON AR. We introduce a
PCA+KMeans trajectory selection strategy enhancing low-data performance.
Results indicate combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional
time integrators yields accurate, physically consistent, and scalable surrogate
models for time-dependent PDEs.

Abstract: High-quality wind power forecasting is crucial for the operation of modern
power grids. However, prevailing data-driven paradigms either train a
site-specific model which cannot generalize to other locations or rely on
fine-tuning of general-purpose time series foundation models which are
difficult to incorporate domain-specific data in the energy sector. This paper
introduces WindFM, a lightweight and generative Foundation Model designed
specifically for probabilistic wind power forecasting. WindFM employs a
discretize-and-generate framework. A specialized time-series tokenizer first
converts continuous multivariate observations into discrete, hierarchical
tokens. Subsequently, a decoder-only Transformer learns a universal
representation of wind generation dynamics by autoregressively pre-training on
these token sequences. Using the comprehensive WIND Toolkit dataset comprising
approximately 150 billion time steps from more than 126,000 sites, WindFM
develops a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between
atmospheric conditions and power output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our compact 8.1M parameter model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance on both deterministic and probabilistic tasks, outperforming
specialized models and larger foundation models without any fine-tuning. In
particular, WindFM exhibits strong adaptiveness under out-of-distribution data
from a different continent, demonstrating the robustness and transferability of
its learned representations. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at

Abstract: Typical financial risk management involves distinct phases for pre-service
risk assessment and in-service default detection, often modeled separately.
This paper proposes a novel framework, Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation
(abbreviated as MGKD), aimed at improving pre-service risk prediction through
the integration of in-service user behavior data. MGKD follows the idea of
knowledge distillation, where the teacher model, trained on historical
in-service data, guides the student model, which is trained on pre-service
data. By using soft labels derived from in-service data, the teacher model
helps the student model improve its risk prediction prior to service
activation. Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced,
including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the
representations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This
approach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also
enables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from
the teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of
pre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to
mitigate the model's bias towards the minority class. Experimental results on
large-scale real-world datasets from Tencent Mobile Payment demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach in both offline and online scenarios.

Abstract: Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational
immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure
methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific
binding sites on the antigens-a dual limitation in representation and
prediction. In this paper, we propose CAME-AB, a novel Cross-modality Attention
framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding
site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities,
including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained
language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined
biochemical graphs-into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance
adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an adaptive modality fusion module
that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance
and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE
module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We
additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to
explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and
generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive
experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB
consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including
Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of
multimodal feature integration. The model implementation details and the codes

Abstract: The wide spreading of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors generates vast
spatio-temporal data streams, but ensuring data credibility is a critical yet
unsolved challenge for applications like smart homes. While spatio-temporal
graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short
in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1)
their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical,
event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations
with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To
address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network
(DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis
in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven
dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect
physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware
representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the
research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive
experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming
the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of

Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown
distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been
widely applied in reinforcement and semisupervised learning as well as computer
vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search and
only a few selection methods can be proved to be theoretically optimal. One of
the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on
optimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)
setting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we
focus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG
setting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs
when the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian.
To extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein
framework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly
projected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original
(unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically
optimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data. Empirical studies show that our
closed-form WGAN parameters have good convergence behavior with data under both
Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Also, compared to the r principal component
analysis (r-PCA) solution, our proposed solution for sliced WGAN can achieve
the same performance while requiring less computational resources.

Abstract: Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in
intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence
of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms
or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited
generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task
transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel
multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to
acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is
pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second
waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track
architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality,
leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality
signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To
efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local
quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism
within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function,
which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect
reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation
of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models
with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy
and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks:
false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial
fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and
ECG signals.

Abstract: Network intrusion detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity.
While supervised machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance,
their reliance on large labelled datasets makes them impractical for many
real-world applications. Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on
benign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive
rates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques
have demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by
learning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In
particular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the
distance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it
between dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive
views through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In
contrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative
pairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented
samples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious
distributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This
approach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after
pretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and
anomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when
fine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves
superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing
self-supervised models.

Abstract: We propose a simple algorithm that needs only a few data samples from a
single graph for learning local routing policies that generalize across a rich
class of geometric random graphs in Euclidean metric spaces. We thus solve the
all-pairs near-shortest path problem by training deep neural networks (DNNs)
that let each graph node efficiently and scalably route (i.e., forward) packets
by considering only the node's state and the state of the neighboring nodes.
Our algorithm design exploits network domain knowledge in the selection of
input features and design of the policy function for learning an approximately
optimal policy. Domain knowledge also provides theoretical assurance that the
choice of a ``seed graph'' and its node data sampling suffices for
generalizable learning. Remarkably, one of these DNNs we train -- using
distance-to-destination as the only input feature -- learns a policy that
exactly matches the well-known Greedy Forwarding policy, which forwards packets
to the neighbor with the shortest distance to the destination. We also learn a
new policy, which we call GreedyTensile routing -- using both
distance-to-destination and node stretch as the input features -- that almost
always outperforms greedy forwarding. We demonstrate the explainability and
ultra-low latency run-time operation of Greedy Tensile routing by symbolically
interpreting its DNN in low-complexity terms of two linear actions.

Motivation: 车载自组织网络(VANETs)在智能交通系统中至关重要，但由于动态拓扑、不完全观测和边缘设备资源有限，路由问题具有挑战性。现有RL方法通常假设固定图结构，需要重新训练，不适合在受限硬件上部署。

Method: TrajAware框架包含三个组件：(1)动作空间剪枝，减少冗余邻居选项同时保持两跳可达性；(2)图交叉注意力，将剪枝邻居映射到全局图上下文；(3)轨迹感知预测，使用历史路由和路口信息估计实时位置。

Result: 在SUMO模拟器中使用真实城市地图进行评估，TrajAware实现了接近最短路径和高交付率，同时在完全和部分观测场景中都优于最先进的基线方法，保持了对受限边缘设备的高效性。

Conclusion: TrajAware为VANETs中的边缘AI部署提供了一个有效的RL框架，能够处理动态网络条件并适应不同的网络规模，适合在资源受限的边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a crucial component of intelligent
transportation systems; however, routing remains challenging due to dynamic
topologies, incomplete observations, and the limited resources of edge devices.
Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph
structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them
unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an
RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware
integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant
neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse
of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to
the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse
network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical
routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial
observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using
real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that
TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while
maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.

Conclusion: RT-HCP为解决机器人控制中的推理延迟问题提供了有效解决方案，在保持样本效率的同时显著改善推理时间

Abstract: Learning a controller directly on the robot requires extreme sample
efficiency. Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods are the most sample
efficient, but they often suffer from a too long inference time to meet the
robot control frequency requirements. In this paper, we address the sample
efficiency and inference time challenges with two contributions. First, we
define a general framework to deal with inference delays where the slow
inference robot controller provides a sequence of actions to feed the
control-hungry robotic platform without execution gaps. Then, we compare
several RL algorithms in the light of this framework and propose RT-HCP, an
algorithm that offers an excellent trade-off between performance, sample
efficiency and inference time. We validate the superiority of RT-HCP with
experiments where we learn a controller directly on a simple but high frequency
FURUTA pendulum platform. Code: github.com/elasriz/RTHCP

Method: 将小波滤波器分解为互补的局部和全局组件：局部聚合使用高效的低阶多项式处理，长距离交互通过灵活的谱域参数化捕获。这种混合设计在小波框架内统一了短距离和长距离信息流。

Conclusion: LR-GWN提供了一种原则性的小波框架，能够有效处理图数据中的长距离交互问题，统一了局部和全局信息传播。

Abstract: Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across
distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning.
Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a
principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing
wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial
approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range
propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which
decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local
aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range
interactions are captured through a flexible spectral domain parameterization.
This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a
principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves
state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range
benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

Motivation: 离线目标条件强化学习在实际应用中面临状态-动作空间覆盖有限和长时程任务泛化困难的挑战，需要更好的值函数学习方法。

Method: 基于Eikonal偏微分方程推导物理信息正则化损失，结合分层隐式Q学习(HIQL)，形成Pi-HIQL方法，在连续时间最优控制框架下优化值函数结构。

Result: Pi-HIQL在性能表现和泛化能力上均有显著提升，特别是在stitching机制和大规模导航任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 物理信息正则化为离线GCRL提供了有效的几何归纳偏置，能够显著改善值函数学习质量和任务泛化性能。

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) holds great promise
for domains such as autonomous navigation and locomotion, where collecting
interactive data is costly and unsafe. However, it remains challenging in
practice due to the need to learn from datasets with limited coverage of the
state-action space and to generalize across long-horizon tasks. To improve on
these challenges, we propose a Physics-informed (Pi) regularized loss for value
learning, derived from the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and
which induces a geometric inductive bias in the learned value function. Unlike
generic gradient penalties that are primarily used to stabilize training, our
formulation is grounded in continuous-time optimal control and encourages value
functions to align with cost-to-go structures. The proposed regularizer is
broadly compatible with temporal-difference-based value learning and can be
integrated into existing Offline GCRL algorithms. When combined with
Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL), the resulting method, Physics-informed
HIQL (Pi-HIQL), yields significant improvements in both performance and
generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale
navigation tasks.

Conclusion: AxelSMOTE通过智能体交互框架有效解决了类别不平衡问题，为机器学习中的不平衡数据处理提供了新思路

Abstract: Class imbalance in machine learning poses a significant challenge, as skewed
datasets often hinder performance on minority classes. Traditional oversampling
techniques, which are commonly used to alleviate class imbalance, have several
drawbacks: they treat features independently, lack similarity-based controls,
limit sample diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively. To
overcome these issues, we introduce AxelSMOTE, an innovative agent-based
approach that views data instances as autonomous agents engaging in complex
interactions. Based on Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, AxelSMOTE
implements four key innovations: (1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve
correlations; (2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for
meaningful interactions; (3) Beta distribution blending for realistic
interpolation; and (4) controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting.
Experiments on eight imbalanced datasets demonstrate that AxelSMOTE outperforms
state-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 现代自适应游戏需要细致的玩家理解，但现有模型使用简化的5-10类别分类法无法捕捉玩家多样性，行为聚类无法区分行为相似但动机不同的玩家。

Method: 使用19,413个AI控制的文本RPG游戏会话数据，比较纯行为基线方法与整合动作序列和语义描述的多模态方法，包括多模态LSTM处理动作-文本对。

Result: 传统聚类在36类别分类中仅达到10%准确率；多模态LSTM将准确率提升至21%；非中性玩家档案准确率达到42%（15倍于随机），中性玩家档案为25%（9倍于随机）。

Conclusion: 行为数据在36类别分类中准确率停滞在10%左右，多模态整合可实现25%准确率。基于个性的自适应需要对话交互，因为预定义选择无法捕捉意图。

Abstract: Modern adaptive games require nuanced player understanding, yet most models
use simplified 5-10 category taxonomies that fail to capture diversity.
Behavioral clustering cannot distinguish players with different motivations who
act similarly. We present a systematic evaluation of multi-modal classification
at scale, combining behavioral telemetry with semantic context to support 36
player profiles. Using 19,413 gameplay sessions from an AI-controlled
text-based RPG, we compared behavioral-only baselines with multi-modal
approaches that integrate action sequences and semantic descriptions.
Traditional clustering achieved only 10% accuracy for 36-category
classification, limited by semantic conflation where opposite actions produced
identical features. Our multi-modal LSTM processing action-text pairs improved
accuracy to 21%, showing both potential and limits of non-conversational data.
Analysis by behavioral complexity revealed that non-neutral profiles reached
42% accuracy (15x above random), while neutral profiles dropped to 25% (9x
above random). Identical actions such as "help the merchant" cannot reveal
whether a player is neutral or strategically waiting. Without access to
reasoning, even multi-modal models struggle, though above-baseline results
confirm a meaningful signal. Since prediction beyond 20 categories remains
unexplored, our findings establish benchmarks for complex player modeling.
Behavioral data alone plateaus near 10% for 36 categories, while multi-modal
integration enables 25%. For designers, this shows that personality-based
adaptation requires conversational interaction, as predefined choices cannot
capture intent. Our evaluation at 36-category scale offers guidance for
building adaptive games that better understand their players.

TL;DR: PLRV-O框架通过参数化噪声分布改进了DP-SGD，在严格隐私约束下显著提升模型性能，在CIFAR-10和SST-2任务上相比高斯噪声分别实现了10%和42%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DP-SGD方法使用高斯或拉普拉斯噪声，其单一参数维度同时控制隐私损失和效用下降，无法独立调节这两个因素。当训练轮数和批次大小变化时，这种耦合会导致隐私-效用权衡的task-dependent偏移，小幅度噪声参数变化可能对模型精度产生不成比例的影响。

Method: 提出PLRV-O框架，定义了一个广泛的参数化DP-SGD噪声分布搜索空间，其中隐私损失矩被严格表征但可以与效用损失更独立地优化。该框架支持针对特定任务需求（模型大小、训练时长、批次采样策略、裁剪阈值）系统性地调整噪声。

Result: 在严格隐私约束下显著提升效用：CIFAR-10上微调ViT在ε≈0.5时达到94.03%准确率（高斯噪声为83.93%）；SST-2上RoBERTa-large在ε≈0.2时达到92.20%准确率（高斯噪声为50.25%）。

Conclusion: PLRV-O框架通过解耦隐私损失和效用损失的优化，实现了对DP-SGD噪声分布的系统性调优，在多个基准任务上证明了其在严格隐私约束下显著提升模型性能的有效性。

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is a standard
method for enforcing privacy in deep learning, typically using the Gaussian
mechanism to perturb gradient updates. However, conventional mechanisms such as
Gaussian and Laplacian noise are parameterized only by variance or scale. This
single degree of freedom ties the magnitude of noise directly to both privacy
loss and utility degradation, preventing independent control of these two
factors. The problem becomes more pronounced when the number of composition
rounds T and batch size B vary across tasks, as these variations induce
task-dependent shifts in the privacy-utility trade-off, where small changes in
noise parameters can disproportionately affect model accuracy. To address this
limitation, we introduce PLRV-O, a framework that defines a broad search space
of parameterized DP-SGD noise distributions, where privacy loss moments are
tightly characterized yet can be optimized more independently with respect to
utility loss. This formulation enables systematic adaptation of noise to
task-specific requirements, including (i) model size, (ii) training duration,
(iii) batch sampling strategies, and (iv) clipping thresholds under both
training and fine-tuning settings. Empirical results demonstrate that PLRV-O
substantially improves utility under strict privacy constraints. On CIFAR-10, a
fine-tuned ViT achieves 94.03% accuracy at epsilon approximately 0.5, compared
to 83.93% with Gaussian noise. On SST-2, RoBERTa-large reaches 92.20% accuracy
at epsilon approximately 0.2, versus 50.25% with Gaussian.

Conclusion: RAS方法在多任务学习中有效处理污染任务，防止负迁移，并可以扩展到迁移学习场景

Abstract: Representation-based multi-task learning (MTL) improves efficiency by
learning a shared structure across tasks, but its practical application is
often hindered by contamination, outliers, or adversarial tasks. Most existing
methods and theories assume a clean or near-clean setting, failing when
contamination is significant. This paper tackles representation MTL with an
unknown and potentially large contamination proportion, while also allowing for
heterogeneity among inlier tasks. We introduce a Robust and Adaptive Spectral
method (RAS) that can distill the shared inlier representation effectively and
efficiently, while requiring no prior knowledge of the contamination level or
the true representation dimension. Theoretically, we provide non-asymptotic
error bounds for both the learned representation and the per-task parameters.
These bounds adapt to inlier task similarity and outlier structure, and
guarantee that RAS performs at least as well as single-task learning, thus
preventing negative transfer. We also extend our framework to transfer learning
with corresponding theoretical guarantees for the target task. Extensive
experiments confirm our theory, showcasing the robustness and adaptivity of
RAS, and its superior performance in regimes with up to 80\% task
contamination.

Conclusion: Dato通过将通信和分片作为一等公民，显著降低了编写优化代码的负担，同时实现了高性能，为数据流加速器提供了有效的编程抽象

Abstract: Recent deep learning workloads increasingly push computational demand beyond
what current memory systems can sustain, with many kernels stalling on data
movement rather than computation. While modern dataflow accelerators
incorporate on-chip streaming to mitigate off-chip bandwidth limitations,
existing programming models struggle to harness these capabilities effectively.
Low-level interfaces provide fine-grained control but impose significant
development overhead, whereas high-level tile-based languages abstract away
communication details, restricting optimization and forcing compilers to
reconstruct the intended dataflow. We present Dato, a Python-embedded,
task-based programming model for dataflow accelerators that elevates data
communication and sharding to first-class type constructs. Developers write
programs as a graph of tasks connected via explicit stream types, with sharded
inputs specified using layout types. These tasks are first mapped virtually
onto the accelerator's spatial fabric, and the compiler then generates a
physical mapping that respects hardware constraints. Experimental results on
both AMD Ryzen AI NPU and Alveo FPGA devices demonstrate that Dato achieves
high performance while significantly reducing the burden of writing optimized
code. On the NPU, Dato attains up to 84% hardware utilization for GEMM and
delivers a 2.81x speedup on attention kernels compared to a state-of-the-art

Abstract: Since their introduction by Kipf and Welling in $2017$, a primary use of
graph convolutional networks is transductive node classification, where missing
labels are inferred within a single observed graph and its feature matrix.
Despite the widespread use of the network model, the statistical foundations of
transductive learning remain limited, as standard inference frameworks
typically rely on multiple independent samples rather than a single graph. In
this work, we address these gaps by developing new concentration-of-measure
tools that leverage the geometric regularities of large graphs via
low-dimensional metric embeddings. The emergent regularities are captured using
a random graph model; however, the methods remain applicable to deterministic
graphs once observed. We establish two principal learning results. The first
concerns arbitrary deterministic $k$-vertex graphs, and the second addresses
random graphs that share key geometric properties with an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
graph $\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{G}(k,p)$ in the regime $p \in \mathcal{O}((\log
(k)/k)^{1/2})$. The first result serves as the basis for and illuminates the
second. We then extend these results to the graph convolutional network
setting, where additional challenges arise. Lastly, our learning guarantees
remain informative even with a few labelled nodes $N$ and achieve the optimal
nonparametric rate $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ as $N$ grows.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have
been significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series
properties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an
intrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing
benchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns,
restricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there
is no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost
expenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream
applications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing
relation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for
recommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we
construct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a
comprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct
an extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the
relationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our
experimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we
propose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing
interpretable suggestions for real-world time series. In summary, ARIES is the
first study to establish the relations between the properties of time series
data and modeling strategies, while also implementing a model recommendation
system. The code is available at: https://github.com/blisky-li/ARIES.

Abstract: While it is well-established that artificial neural networks are
\emph{universal approximators} for continuous functions on compact domains,
many modern approaches rely on deep or overparameterized architectures that
incur high computational costs. In this paper, a new type of \emph{small
shallow} neural network, called the \emph{Barycentric Neural Network} ($\BNN$),
is proposed, which leverages a fixed set of \emph{base points} and their
\emph{barycentric coordinates} to define both its structure and its parameters.
We demonstrate that our $\BNN$ enables the exact representation of
\emph{continuous piecewise linear functions} ($\CPLF$s), ensuring strict
continuity across segments. Since any continuous function over a compact domain
can be approximated arbitrarily well by $\CPLF$s, the $\BNN$ naturally emerges
as a flexible and interpretable tool for \emph{function approximation}. Beyond
the use of this representation, the main contribution of the paper is the
introduction of a new variant of \emph{persistent entropy}, a topological
feature that is stable and scale invariant, called the \emph{length-weighted
persistent entropy} ($\LWPE$), which is weighted by the lifetime of topological
features. Our framework, which combines the $\BNN$ with a loss function based
on our $\LWPE$, aims to provide flexible and geometrically interpretable
approximations of nonlinear continuous functions in resource-constrained
settings, such as those with limited base points for $\BNN$ design and few
training epochs. Instead of optimizing internal weights, our approach directly
\emph{optimizes the base points that define the $\BNN$}. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves \emph{superior and faster approximation
performance} compared to classical loss functions such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and
log-cosh.

Motivation: 解决图神经网络中的过度挤压(Oversquashing)问题，该问题限制了远距离节点间的消息传播，传统图重连方法会损害归纳偏置并导致信息损失

Method: 提出模型无关的异步更新框架，基于节点中心性值创建批次，在每层只更新批次内节点特征，避免同步消息传递中的信息压缩

Result: 在6个标准图数据集和2个长距离数据集上测试，在REDDIT-BINARY和Peptides-struct上分别获得5%和4%的性能提升

Conclusion: 异步消息传递框架能有效缓解过度挤压问题，保持更高的特征敏感度边界，且不增加模型参数复杂度

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from Oversquashing, which occurs when
tasks require long-range interactions. The problem arises from the presence of
bottlenecks that limit the propagation of messages among distant nodes.
Recently, graph rewiring methods modify edge connectivity and are expected to
perform well on long-range tasks. Yet, graph rewiring compromises the inductive
bias, incurring significant information loss in solving the downstream task.
Furthermore, increasing channel capacity may overcome information bottlenecks
but enhance the parameter complexity of the model. To alleviate these
shortcomings, we propose an efficient model-agnostic framework that
asynchronously updates node features, unlike traditional synchronous message
passing GNNs. Our framework creates node batches in every layer based on the
node centrality values. The features of the nodes belonging to these batches
will only get updated. Asynchronous message updates process information
sequentially across layers, avoiding simultaneous compression into
fixed-capacity channels. We also theoretically establish that our proposed
framework maintains higher feature sensitivity bounds compared to standard
synchronous approaches. Our framework is applied to six standard graph datasets
and two long-range datasets to perform graph classification and achieves
impressive performances with a $5\%$ and $4\%$ improvements on REDDIT-BINARY
and Peptides-struct, respectively.

Conclusion: HyGLAD提供了一种可解释且高效的异常检测替代方案，在性能和可解释性方面都优于深度学习方法

Abstract: We propose HyGLAD, a novel algorithm that automatically builds a set of
interpretable patterns that model event data. These patterns can then be used
to detect event-based anomalies in a stationary system, where any deviation
from past behavior may indicate malicious activity. The algorithm infers
equivalence classes of entities with similar behavior observed from the events,
and then builds regular expressions that capture the values of those entities.
As opposed to deep-learning approaches, the regular expressions are directly
interpretable, which also translates to interpretable anomalies. We evaluate
HyGLAD against all 7 unsupervised anomaly detection methods from DeepOD on five
datasets from real-world systems. The experimental results show that on average
HyGLAD outperforms existing deep-learning methods while being an order of
magnitude more efficient in training and inference (single CPU vs GPU).
Precision improved by 1.2x and recall by 1.3x compared to the second-best

Conclusion: 在实际应用中，查询策略的选择取决于标注专家的专业水平和愿意标注的样本数量。只要能够进行查询，推荐使用基于主动学习的阈值方法。

Abstract: Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in
the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which
hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be
unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is
often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning
with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying
the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the
threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query
strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to
maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between
anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance
of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of
mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings
indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others
appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real
world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and
the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query
strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of
mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an
active learning-based threshold is recommended.

the former, we previously introduced Precision-Recall Curve (PRC)

integrates PRC-RF with autoencoders, unsupervised machine learning methods that
learn compact latent representations, to confront both challenges
simultaneously. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the resulting Autoencoder-PRC-RF model achieves superior
accuracy, scalability, and interpretability relative to prior methods,
affirming its potential for high-stakes anomaly-detection tasks.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic
systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing
solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target
variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into
the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to
promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two
challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the
target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and
future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a
novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in
\underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select,
then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated
expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent
space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized
sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which
recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into
dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs
are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic
balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency
of our proposed framework.

Abstract: Deploying neural networks on edge devices entails a careful balance between
the energy required for inference and the accuracy of the resulting
classification. One technique for navigating this tradeoff is approximate
computing: the process of reducing energy consumption by slightly reducing the
accuracy of arithmetic operators. In this context, we propose a methodology to
reduce the area of the small arithmetic operators used in neural networks -
i.e., adders and multipliers - via a small loss in accuracy, and show that we
improve area savings for the same accuracy loss w.r.t. the state of the art. To
achieve our goal, we improve on a boolean rewriting technique recently
proposed, called XPAT, where the use of a parametrisable template to rewrite
circuits has proved to be highly beneficial. In particular, XPAT was able to
produce smaller circuits than comparable approaches while utilising a naive sum
of products template structure. In this work, we show that template parameters
can act as proxies for chosen metrics and we propose a novel template based on
parametrisable product sharing that acts as a close proxy to synthesised area.
We demonstrate experimentally that our methodology converges better to low-area
solutions and that it can find better approximations than both the original
XPAT and two other state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) systems require environment-aware communication, driven
by native artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC). Radio maps (RMs), providing spatially continuous channel information,
are key enablers. However, generating high-fidelity RM ground truth via
electromagnetic (EM) simulations is computationally intensive, motivating
machine learning (ML)-based RM construction. The effectiveness of these
data-driven methods depends on large-scale, high-quality training data. Current
public datasets often focus on single-input single-output (SISO) and limited
information, such as path loss, which is insufficient for advanced multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems requiring detailed channel state information (CSI).
To address this gap, this paper presents UrbanMIMOMap, a novel large-scale
urban MIMO CSI dataset generated using high-precision ray tracing. UrbanMIMOMap
offers comprehensive complex CSI matrices across a dense spatial grid, going
beyond traditional path loss data. This rich CSI is vital for constructing
high-fidelity RMs and serves as a fundamental resource for data-driven RM
generation, including deep learning. We demonstrate the dataset's utility
through baseline performance evaluations of representative ML methods for RM
construction. This work provides a crucial dataset and reference for research
in high-precision RM generation, MIMO spatial performance, and ML for 6G
environment awareness. The code and data for this work are available at:

a dataset of over 3000 meal records collected by 114 individuals from a
diverse, low income community in a major US city using a mobile app. Registered
dietitians provided expert judgement for meal to goal alignment, used as gold
standard for evaluation. Using text embeddings, including TFIDF and BERT, and
domain specific enrichment information, including ontologies, ingredient
parsers, and macronutrient contents as inputs, we evaluated the performance of
logistic regression and multilayer perceptron classifiers using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score against the gold standard and self assessment.
Even without enrichment, ML outperformed self assessments of individuals who
logged meals, and the best performing combination of ML classifier with
enrichment achieved even higher accuracies. In general, ML classifiers with
enrichment of Parsed Ingredients, Food Entities, and Macronutrients information
performed well across multiple nutritional goals, but there was variability in
the impact of enrichment and classification algorithm on accuracy of
classification for different nutritional goals. In conclusion, ML can utilize
unstructured free text meal logs and reliably classify whether meals align with
specific nutritional goals, exceeding self assessments, especially when
incorporating nutrition domain knowledge. Our findings highlight the potential
of ML analysis of patient generated health data to support patient centered
nutrition guidance in precision healthcare.

Abstract: Selecting key variables from high-dimensional data is increasingly important

purpose by promoting model simplicity and explainability. In this work, we
revisit a valuable yet underutilized method, the statistical physics-based
Variational Garrote (VG), which introduces explicit feature selection spin
variables and leverages variational inference to derive a tractable loss
function. We enhance VG by incorporating modern automatic differentiation
techniques, enabling scalable and efficient optimization. We evaluate VG on
both fully controllable synthetic datasets and complex real-world datasets. Our
results demonstrate that VG performs especially well in highly sparse regimes,
offering more consistent and robust variable selection than Ridge and LASSO
regression across varying levels of sparsity. We also uncover a sharp
transition: as superfluous variables are admitted, generalization degrades
abruptly and the uncertainty of the selection variables increases. This
transition point provides a practical signal for estimating the correct number
of relevant variables, an insight we successfully apply to identify key
predictors in real-world data. We expect that VG offers strong potential for
sparse modeling across a wide range of applications, including compressed
sensing and model pruning in machine learning.

they were trained. In this article we test a transformer designed for lane
change intention prediction on two datasets collected by LevelX in Germany and
Hong Kong. We found that the transformer's accuracy plummeted when tested on a
population different to the one it was trained on with accuracy values as low
as 39.43%, but that when trained on both populations simultaneously it could

Abstract: Objective: To develop and interpret a supervised variational autoencoder
(VAE) model for classifying cardiotocography (CTG) signals based on pregnancy
outcomes, addressing interpretability limits of current deep learning
approaches. Methods: The OxMat CTG dataset was used to train a VAE on
five-minute fetal heart rate (FHR) segments, labeled with postnatal outcomes.
The model was optimised for signal reconstruction and outcome prediction,
incorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation (TC)
constraints to structure the latent space. Performance was evaluated using area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and mean squared
error (MSE). Interpretability was assessed using coefficient of determination,
latent traversals and unsupervised component analyses. Results: The model
achieved an AUROC of 0.752 at the segment level and 0.779 at the CTG level,
where predicted scores were aggregated. Relaxing TC constraints improved both
reconstruction and classification. Latent analysis showed that baseline-related
features (e.g., FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned
with model scores, while metrics like short- and long-term variability were
less strongly encoded. Traversals revealed clear signal changes for baseline
features, while other properties were entangled or subtle. Unsupervised
decompositions corroborated these patterns. Findings: This work demonstrates
that supervised VAEs can achieve competitive fetal outcome prediction while
partially encoding clinically meaningful CTG features. The irregular,
multi-timescale nature of FHR signals poses challenges for disentangling
physiological components, distinguishing CTG from more periodic signals such as
ECG. Although full interpretability was not achieved, the model supports
clinically useful outcome prediction and provides a basis for future

Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and
dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for
data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in
structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity
bounds.
  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between
measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces
to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities
for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a
memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a
measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law
of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical
bounds based on the Second Law.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty
Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be
minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist
complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic
effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance
to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a
model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance
components are inherently easier to learn.
  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual
learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower
training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization
experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable,
theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.

Result: 为单层GCN推导了新颖的泛化边界，建立了节点数量增加时泛化差距收敛到零的充分条件。对双层GCN的分析表明需要更强的图拓扑假设来保证收敛

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解和改进动态图环境中GNN的泛化能力建立了理论基础

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in processing
graph-structured data across various applications. A critical aspect of
real-world graphs is their dynamic nature, where new nodes are continually
added and existing connections may change over time. Previous theoretical
studies, largely based on the transductive learning framework, fail to
adequately model such temporal evolution and structural dynamics. In this
paper, we presents a PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent
and non-identically distributed data points. We derive novel generalization
bounds for one-layer GCNs that explicitly incorporate the effects of data
dependency and non-stationarity, and establish sufficient conditions under
which the generalization gap converges to zero as the number of nodes
increases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to two-layer GCNs, and reveal
that it requires stronger assumptions on graph topology to guarantee
convergence. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding
and improving GNN generalization in dynamic graph environments.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted increasing attention in recent
years for identifying malicious samples in a wide range of graph-based
applications, such as social media and e-commerce. However, most GAD methods
assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to
specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios such
as shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications.
To address the limitations, recent work has focused on improving the
generalization capability of GAD models through transfer learning that
leverages knowledge from related domains to enhance detection performance, or
developing "one-for-all" GAD foundation models that generalize across multiple
applications. Since a systematic understanding of generalization in GAD is
still lacking, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of
generalization in GAD. We first trace the evolution of generalization in GAD
and formalize the problem settings, which further leads to our systematic
taxonomy. Rooted in this fine-grained taxonomy, an up-to-date and comprehensive
review is conducted for the existing generalized GAD methods. Finally, we
identify current open challenges and suggest future directions to inspire
future research in this emerging field.

Conclusion: gcGAIL模型能够预测任何时间点的个体行为响应，为个性化激励措施提供基础，以引导可持续行为变化

Abstract: Understanding and modeling individual travel behavior responses is crucial
for urban mobility regulation and policy evaluation. The Markov decision
process (MDP) provides a structured framework for dynamic travel behavior
modeling at the individual level. However, solving an MDP in this context is
highly data-intensive and faces challenges of data quantity, spatial-temporal
coverage, and situational diversity. To address these, we propose a
group-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) model
that improves the individual behavior modeling efficiency by leveraging shared
behavioral patterns among passenger groups. We validate the gcGAIL model using
a public transport fare-discount case study and compare against
state-of-the-art benchmarks, including adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL), baseline GAIL, and conditional GAIL. Experimental results
demonstrate that gcGAIL outperforms these methods in learning individual travel
behavior responses to incentives over time in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Notably, gcGAIL is robust
to spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, maintaining
strong performance even with partial expert demonstrations and underrepresented
passenger groups. The gcGAIL model predicts the individual behavior response at
any time, providing the basis for personalized incentives to induce sustainable
behavior changes (better timing of incentive injections).

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects is critical in domains such as
personalized medicine, resource allocation, and policy evaluation. A central
challenge lies in identifying subpopulations that respond differently to
interventions, thereby enabling more targeted and effective decision-making.
While clustering methods are well-studied in unsupervised learning, their
integration with causal inference remains limited. We propose a novel framework
that clusters individuals based on estimated treatment effects using a learned
kernel derived from causal forests, revealing latent subgroup structures. Our
approach consists of two main steps. First, we estimate debiased Conditional
Average Treatment Effects (CATEs) using orthogonalized learners via the
Robinson decomposition, yielding a kernel matrix that encodes sample-level
similarities in treatment responsiveness. Second, we apply kernelized
clustering to this matrix to uncover distinct, treatment-sensitive
subpopulations and compute cluster-level average CATEs. We present this
kernelized clustering step as a form of regularization within the
residual-on-residual regression framework. Through extensive experiments on
semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, supported by ablation studies and
exploratory analyses, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
capturing meaningful treatment effect heterogeneity.

Abstract: When developing scientific machine learning (ML) approaches, it is often
beneficial to embed knowledge of the physical system in question into the
training process. One way to achieve this is by leveraging the specific
characteristics of the data at hand. In the case of turbulent flows, fluid
velocities can be measured and recorded as multi-component vectors at discrete
points in space, using techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) or
computational fluid mechanics (CFD). However, the vectorised nature of the data
is ignored by standard ML approaches, as widely-used loss functions such as the
mean-square error treat each component of a velocity vector in isolation.
Therefore, the aim of this work is to better preserve the physical
characteristics of the data by introducing loss functions that utilise vector
similarity metrics. To this end, vector-based loss functions are developed here
and implemented alongside a U-Net model for a turbulent flow field inpainting
problem, amounting to the prediction of velocity vectors inside large gaps in
PIV images. The intention is for the inpainting task to pose a significant
challenge for the ML models in order to shed light on their capabilities. The
test case uses PIV data from the highly turbulent flow in the well-known
Transparent Combustion Chamber III (TCC-III) engine. Loss functions based on
the cosine similarity and vector magnitude differences are proposed; the
results show that the vector-based loss functions lead to significantly
improved predictions of multi-scale flow patterns, while a hybrid (vector and
mean-square error) loss function enables a good compromise to be found between
preserving multi-scale behaviour and pixel-wise accuracy.

Abstract: The reliable identification of magnetic ground states remains a major
challenge in high-throughput materials databases, where density functional
theory (DFT) workflows often converge to ferromagnetic (FM) solutions. Here, we
partially address this challenge by developing machine learning classifiers
trained on experimentally validated MAGNDATA magnetic materials leveraging a
limited number of simple compositional, structural, and electronic descriptors
sourced from the Materials Project database. Our propagation vector classifiers
achieve accuracies above 92%, outperforming recent studies in reliably
distinguishing zero from nonzero propagation vector structures, and exposing a
systematic ferromagnetic bias inherent to the Materials Project database for
more than 7,843 materials. In parallel, LightGBM and XGBoost models trained
directly on the Materials Project labels achieve accuracies of 84-86% (with
macro F1 average scores of 63-66%), which proves useful for large-scale
screening for magnetic classes, if refined by MAGNDATA-trained classifiers.
These results underscore the role of machine learning techniques as corrective

progress toward the identification of materials with various properties.

Abstract: Swarm intelligence algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in solving
complex optimization problems across diverse domains. However, their widespread
adoption is often hindered by limited transparency in how algorithmic
components influence performance. This work presents a multi-faceted
investigation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to further understand the
key role of different topologies for better interpretability and
explainability. To achieve this objective, we first develop a comprehensive
landscape characterization framework using Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA)
to quantify problem difficulty and identify critical features affecting the
optimization performance of PSO. Next, we conduct a rigorous empirical study
comparing three fundamental swarm communication architectures -- Ring, Star,
and Von Neumann topologies -- analysing their distinct impacts on
exploration-exploitation balance, convergence behaviour, and solution quality
and eventually develop an explainable benchmarking framework for PSO, to decode
how swarm topologies affects information flow, diversity, and convergence.
Based on this, a novel machine learning approach for automated algorithm
configuration is introduced for training predictive models on extensive Area
over the Convergence Curve (AOCC) data to recommend optimal settings based on
problem characteristics. Through systematic experimentation across twenty four
benchmark functions in multiple dimensions, we establish practical guidelines
for topology selection and parameter configuration. These findings advance the
development of more transparent and reliable swarm intelligence systems. The

Abstract: Capturing the dynamics of active particles, i.e., small self-propelled agents
that both deform and are deformed by a fluid in which they move is a formidable
problem as it requires coupling fine scale hydrodynamics with large scale
collective effects. So we present a multi-scale framework that combines the
three learning-driven tools to learn in concert within one pipeline. We use
high-resolution Lattice Boltzmann snapshots of fluid velocity and particle
stresses in a periodic box as input to the learning pipeline. the second step
takes the morphology and positions orientations of particles to predict
pairwise interaction forces between them with a E(2)-equivariant graph neural
network that necessarily respect flat symmetries. Then, a physics-informed
neural network further updates these local estimates by summing over them with
a stress data using Fourier feature mappings and residual blocks that is
additionally regularized with a topological term (introduced by persistent
homology) to penalize unrealistically tangled or spurious connections. In
concert, these stages deliver an holistic highly-data driven full force network
prediction empathizing on the physical underpinnings together with emerging
multi-scale structure typical for active matter.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), comprising diverse clinical data such as
diagnoses, medications, and laboratory results, hold great promise for
translational research. EHR-derived data have advanced disease prevention,
improved clinical trial recruitment, and generated real-world evidence.
Synthesizing EHRs across institutions enables large-scale, generalizable
studies that capture rare diseases and population diversity, but remains
hindered by the heterogeneity of medical codes, institution-specific
terminologies, and the absence of standardized data structures. These barriers
limit the interpretability, comparability, and scalability of EHR-based
analyses, underscoring the need for robust methods to harmonize and extract
meaningful insights from distributed, heterogeneous data. To address this, we
propose MASH (Multi-source Automated Structured Hierarchy), a fully automated
framework that aligns medical codes across institutions using neural optimal
transport and constructs hierarchical graphs with learned hyperbolic
embeddings. During training, MASH integrates information from pre-trained
language models, co-occurrence patterns, textual descriptions, and supervised
labels to capture semantic and hierarchical relationships among medical
concepts more effectively. Applied to real-world EHR data, including diagnosis,
medication, and laboratory codes, MASH produces interpretable hierarchical
graphs that facilitate the navigation and understanding of heterogeneous
clinical data. Notably, it generates the first automated hierarchies for
unstructured local laboratory codes, establishing foundational references for
downstream applications.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of exchange rates remains a persistent challenge,
particularly for emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China
(BRIC). These series exhibit long memory, nonlinearity, and non-stationarity
properties that conventional time series models struggle to capture.
Additionally, there exist several key drivers of exchange rate dynamics,
including global economic policy uncertainty, US equity market volatility, US
monetary policy uncertainty, oil price growth rates, and country-specific
short-term interest rate differentials. These empirical complexities underscore
the need for a flexible modeling framework that can jointly accommodate long
memory, nonlinearity, and the influence of external drivers. To address these
challenges, we propose a Neural AutoRegressive Fractionally Integrated Moving
Average (NARFIMA) model that combines the long-memory representation of ARFIMA
with the nonlinear learning capacity of neural networks, while flexibly
incorporating exogenous causal variables. We establish theoretical properties
of the model, including asymptotic stationarity of the NARFIMA process using
Markov chains and nonlinear time series techniques. We quantify forecast
uncertainty using conformal prediction intervals within the NARFIMA framework.
Empirical results across six forecast horizons show that NARFIMA consistently
outperforms various state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models in
forecasting BRIC exchange rates. These findings provide new insights for
policymakers and market participants navigating volatile financial conditions.
The \texttt{narfima} \textbf{R} package provides an implementation of our

Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems with spatial structure and
external control is an important challenge in quantum information science.
Classical numerical solvers for such systems require integrating coupled master
and field equations, which is computationally demanding for simulation and
optimization tasks and often precluding real-time use in network-scale
simulations or feedback control. We introduce a regional attention-based neural
architecture that learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of structured open quantum
systems. The model incorporates translational invariance of physical laws as an
inductive bias to achieve scalable complexity, and supports conditioning on
time-dependent global control parameters. We demonstrate learning on two
representative systems: a driven dissipative single qubit and an
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memory. The model
achieves high predictive fidelity under both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution control protocols, and provides substantial acceleration up
to three orders of magnitude over numerical solvers. These results demonstrate
that the architecture establishes a general surrogate modeling framework for

Abstract: Solar energy adoption is critical to achieving net-zero emissions. However,
it remains difficult for many industrial and commercial actors to decide on
whether they should adopt distributed solar-battery systems, which is largely
due to the unavailability of fast, low-cost, and high-resolution irradiance
forecasts. Here, we present SunCastNet, a lightweight data-driven forecasting
system that provides 0.05$^\circ$, 10-minute resolution predictions of surface
solar radiation downwards (SSRD) up to 7 days ahead. SunCastNet, coupled with
reinforcement learning (RL) for battery scheduling, reduces operational regret
by 76--93\% compared to robust decision making (RDM). In 25-year investment
backtests, it enables up to five of ten high-emitting industrial sectors per
region to cross the commercial viability threshold of 12\% Internal Rate of
Return (IRR). These results show that high-resolution, long-horizon solar
forecasts can directly translate into measurable economic gains, supporting
near-optimal energy operations and accelerating renewable deployment.

Conclusion: 提出的风险规避分类方法有效提升了多分类问题的鲁棒性和公平性，特别适用于数据质量差的高维多分类场景。

Abstract: We develop a new classification framework based on the theory of coherent
risk measures and systemic risk. The proposed approach is suitable for
multi-class problems when the data is noisy, scarce (relative to the dimension
of the problem), and the labeling might be unreliable. In the first part of our
paper, we provide the foundation of the use of systemic risk models and show
how to apply it in the context of linear and kernel-based multi-class problems.
More advanced formulation via a system-theoretic approach with non-linear
aggregation is proposed, which leads to a two-stage stochastic programming
problem. A risk-averse regularized decomposition method is designed to solve
the problem. We use a popular multi-class method as a benchmark in the
performance analysis of the proposed classification methods. We illustrate our
ideas by proposing several generalization of that method by the use of coherent
measures of risk. The viability of the proposed risk-averse methods are
supported theoretically and numerically. Additionally, we demonstrate that the
application of systemic risk measures facilitates enforcing fairness in
classification. Analysis and experiments regarding the fairness of the proposed
models are carefully conducted. For all methods, our numerical experiments
demonstrate that they are robust in the presence of unreliable training data
and perform better on unknown data than the methods minimizing expected
classification errors. Furthermore, the performance improves when the number of
classes increases.

Abstract: These notes offer a unified introduction to spectral methods for the study of
complex systems. They are intended as an operative manual rather than a
theorem-proof textbook: the emphasis is on tools, identities, and perspectives
that can be readily applied across disciplines. Beginning with a compendium of
matrix identities and inversion techniques, the text develops the connections
between spectra, dynamics, and structure in finite-dimensional systems.
Applications range from dynamical stability and random walks on networks to
input-output economics, PageRank, epidemic spreading, memristive circuits,
synchronization phenomena, and financial stability. Throughout, the guiding
principle is that eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and resolvent operators provide a
common language linking problems in physics, mathematics, computer science, and
beyond. The presentation is informal, accessible to advanced undergraduates,
yet broad enough to serve as a reference for researchers interested in spectral
approaches to complex systems.

Abstract: Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with
biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function
approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training
BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we
propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define
training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL,
enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a
learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in
biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in
which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback
control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease
model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to
external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based
learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.

Abstract: A morphological perceptron is a multilayer feedforward neural network in
which neurons perform elementary operations from mathematical morphology. For
multiclass classification tasks, a morphological perceptron with a competitive
layer (MPCL) is obtained by integrating a winner-take-all output layer into the
standard morphological architecture. The non-differentiability of morphological
operators renders gradient-based optimization methods unsuitable for training
such networks. Consequently, alternative strategies that do not depend on
gradient information are commonly adopted. This paper proposes the use of the
convex-concave procedure (CCP) for training MPCL networks. The training problem
is formulated as a difference of convex (DC) functions and solved iteratively
using CCP, resulting in a sequence of linear programming subproblems.
Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
training method in addressing classification tasks with MPCL networks.

Abstract: A surrogate model is developed to predict the convective heat transfer
coefficient of liquid sodium (Na) flow within rectangular miniature heat sinks.
Initially, kernel-based machine learning techniques and shallow neural network
are applied to a dataset with 87 Nusselt numbers for liquid sodium in
rectangular miniature heat sinks. Subsequently, a self-supervised
physics-informed neural network and transfer learning approach are used to
increase the estimation performance. In the self-supervised physics-informed
neural network, an additional layer determines the weight the of physics in the
loss function to balance data and physics based on their uncertainty for a
better estimation. For transfer learning, a shallow neural network trained on
water is adapted for use with Na. Validation results show that the
self-supervised physics-informed neural network successfully estimate the heat
transfer rates of Na with an error margin of approximately +8%. Using only
physics for regression, the error remains between 5% to 10%. Other machine
learning methods specify the prediction mostly within +8%. High-fidelity
modeling of turbulent forced convection of liquid metals using computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and computationally expensive.
Therefore, machine learning based models offer a powerful alternative tool for

Abstract: Finite element method (FEM) is widely used in high-temperature
superconducting (HTS) magnets, but its computational cost increases with magnet
size and becomes time-consuming for meter-scale magnets, especially when
multi-physics couplings are considered, which limits the fast design of
large-scale REBCO magnet systems. In this work, a surrogate model based on a
fully connected residual neural network (FCRN) is developed to predict the
space-time current density distribution in REBCO solenoids. Training datasets
were generated from FEM simulations with varying numbers of turns and pancakes.
The results demonstrate that, for deeper networks, the FCRN architecture
achieves better convergence than conventional fully connected network (FCN),
with the configuration of 12 residual blocks and 256 neurons per layer
providing the most favorable balance between training accuracy and
generalization capability. Extrapolation studies show that the model can
reliably predict magnetization losses for up to 50% beyond the training range,
with maximum errors below 10%. The surrogate model achieves predictions several
orders of magnitude faster than FEM and still remains advantageous when
training costs are included. These results indicate that the proposed
FCRN-based surrogate model provides both accuracy and efficiency, offering a
promising tool for the rapid analysis of large-scale HTS magnets.

Abstract: Urban analytics utilizes extensive datasets with diverse urban information to

visual analytics tools have been developed to support the exploration of latent
representations of fused heterogeneous and multimodal data, discretized at a
street-level of detail. However, visualization-assisted tools seldom explore
the extent to which fused data can offer deeper insights than examining each
data source independently within an integrated visualization framework. In this
work, we developed a visualization-assisted framework to analyze whether fused
latent data representations are more effective than separate representations in
uncovering patterns from dynamic and static urban data. The analysis reveals
that combined latent representations produce more structured patterns, while
separate ones are useful in particular cases.

Abstract: Silent Data Errors (SDEs) from time-zero defects and aging degrade

expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact
probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk
assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to
capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders
predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method
reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean
absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features
from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points
by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The
approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream

Conclusion: 该工作为未来无线网络中约束资源分配提供了一个可扩展且理论基础扎实的解决方案。

Abstract: Meeting minimum data rate constraints is a significant challenge in wireless
communication systems, particularly as network complexity grows. Traditional
deep learning approaches often address these constraints by incorporating
penalty terms into the loss function and tuning hyperparameters empirically.
However, this heuristic treatment offers no theoretical convergence guarantees
and frequently fails to satisfy QoS requirements in practical scenarios.
Building upon the structure of the WMMSE algorithm, we first extend it to a
multi-channel setting with QoS constraints, resulting in the enhanced WMMSE
(eWMMSE) algorithm, which is provably convergent to a locally optimal solution
when the problem is feasible. To further reduce computational complexity and
improve scalability, we develop a GNN-based algorithm, JCPGNN-M, capable of
supporting simultaneous multi-channel allocation per user. To overcome the
limitations of traditional deep learning methods, we propose a principled
framework that integrates GNN with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization
method. By training the GNN within the Lagrangian framework, we ensure
satisfaction of QoS constraints and convergence to a stationary point.
Extensive simulations demonstrate that JCPGNN-M matches the performance of
eWMMSE while offering significant gains in inference speed, generalization to
larger networks, and robustness under imperfect channel state information. This
work presents a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for constrained
resource allocation in future wireless networks.

Abstract: Empathy in young children is crucial for their social and emotional
development, yet predicting it remains challenging. Traditional methods often
only rely on self-reports or observer-based labeling, which are susceptible to
bias and fail to objectively capture the process of empathy formation. EEG
offers an objective alternative; however, current approaches primarily extract
static patterns, neglecting temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel deep learning framework, the Brainwave Empathy Assessment
Model (BEAM), to predict empathy levels in children aged 4-6 years. BEAM
leverages multi-view EEG signals to capture both cognitive and emotional
dimensions of empathy. The framework comprises three key components: 1) a
LaBraM-based encoder for effective spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) a
feature fusion module to integrate complementary information from multi-view
signals, and 3) a contrastive learning module to enhance class separation.
Validated on the CBCP dataset, BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
multiple metrics, demonstrating its potential for objective empathy assessment
and providing a preliminary insight into early interventions in children's
prosocial development.

Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and
interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the
physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density,
roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is
inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g.
lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models
have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines.
Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when
replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a
novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by
performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein,
automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of
the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these
quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful
modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited
in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case
studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz
film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of
organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library
of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so
that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.

Abstract: Brain morphology is shaped by genetic and mechanical factors and is linked to
biological development and diseases. Its fractal-like features, regional
anisotropy, and complex curvature distributions hinder quantitative insights in
medical inspections. Recognizing that the underlying elastic instability and
bifurcation share the same physics as simple geometries such as spheres and
ellipses, we developed a physics-transfer learning framework to address the
geometrical complexity. To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we
constructed a digital library of high-fidelity continuum mechanics modeling
that both describes and predicts the developmental processes of brain growth
and disease. The physics of nonlinear elasticity from simple geometries is
embedded into a neural network and applied to brain models. This
physics-transfer approach demonstrates remarkable performance in feature
characterization and morphogenesis prediction, highlighting the pivotal role of
localized deformation in dominating over the background geometry. The
data-driven framework also provides a library of reduced-dimensional
evolutionary representations that capture the essential physics of the highly
folded cerebral cortex. Validation through medical images and domain expertise
underscores the deployment of digital-twin technology in comprehending the
morphological complexity of the brain.

Abstract: To overcome the inherent inefficiencies of traditional trial-and-error

closed-loop experimental workflows. In this work, we realize this concept for
thermoresponsive polymers by developing a low-cost, "frugal twin" platform for

fluid-handling, on-line sensors, and Bayesian optimization (BO) that navigates
the multi-component salt solution spaces to achieve user-specified LCST
targets. The platform demonstrates convergence to target properties within a
minimal number of experiments. It strategically explores the parameter space,
learns from informative "off-target" results, and self-corrects to achieve the
final targets. By providing an accessible and adaptable blueprint, this work
lowers the barrier to entry for autonomous experimentation and accelerates the

Abstract: In wireless networks characterized by dense connectivity, the significant
signaling overhead generated by distributed link scheduling algorithms can
exacerbate issues like congestion, energy consumption, and radio footprint
expansion. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a distributed link
sparsification scheme employing graph neural networks (GNNs) to reduce
scheduling overhead for delay-tolerant traffic while maintaining network
capacity. A GNN module is trained to adjust contention thresholds for
individual links based on traffic statistics and network topology, enabling
links to withdraw from scheduling contention when they are unlikely to succeed.
Our approach is facilitated by a novel offline constrained {unsupervised}
learning algorithm capable of balancing two competing objectives: minimizing
scheduling overhead while ensuring that total utility meets the required level.
In simulated wireless multi-hop networks with up to 500 links, our link
sparsification technique effectively alleviates network congestion and reduces
radio footprints across four distinct distributed link scheduling protocols.

Abstract: Continued progress in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) requires solving
inverse problems relating experimental observations to simulation input
parameters, followed by design optimization. However, such high dimensional
dynamic PDE-constrained optimization problems are extremely challenging or even
intractable. It has been recently shown that inverse problems can be solved by
only considering certain robust features. Here we consider the ICF capsule's
deuterium-tritium (DT) interface, and construct a causal, dynamic,
multifidelity reduced-order surrogate that maps from a time-dependent radiation
temperature drive to the interface's radius and velocity dynamics. The
surrogate targets an ODE embedding of DT interface dynamics, and is constructed
by learning a controller for a base analytical model using low- and
high-fidelity simulation training data with respect to radiation energy group
structure. After demonstrating excellent accuracy of the surrogate interface
model, we use machine learning (ML) models with surrogate-generated data to
solve inverse problems optimizing radiation temperature drive to reproduce
observed interface dynamics. For sparse snapshots in time, the ML model further
characterizes the most informative times at which to sample dynamics.
Altogether we demonstrate how operator learning, causal architectures, and
physical inductive bias can be integrated to accelerate discovery, design, and
diagnostics in high-energy-density systems.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) enables high-resolution imaging of
biomolecules, but structural heterogeneity remains a major challenge in 3D
reconstruction. Traditional methods assume a discrete set of conformations,
limiting their ability to recover continuous structural variability. In this
work, we formulate cryo-EM reconstruction as a stochastic inverse problem (SIP)
over probability measures, where the observed images are modeled as the
push-forward of an unknown distribution over molecular structures via a random
forward operator. We pose the reconstruction problem as the minimization of a
variational discrepancy between observed and simulated image distributions,
using statistical distances such as the KL divergence and the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy. The resulting optimization is performed over the space of
probability measures via a Wasserstein gradient flow, which we numerically
solve using particles to represent and evolve conformational ensembles. We
validate our approach using synthetic examples, including a realistic protein
model, which demonstrates its ability to recover continuous distributions over
structural states. We analyze the connection between our formulation and
Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) approaches, which can be interpreted as instances of
the discretize-then-optimize (DTO) framework. We further provide a consistency
analysis, establishing conditions under which DTO methods, such as MAP
estimation, converge to the solution of the underlying infinite-dimensional
continuous problem. Beyond cryo-EM, the framework provides a general
methodology for solving SIPs involving random forward operators.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural density estimation have enabled powerful
simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that can flexibly approximate Bayesian
inference for intractable stochastic models. Although these methods have
demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately
represents the underlying data generative process (GDP), recent work has shown
that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses
a significant problem for their use on real-world problems, due to simulators
always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we
introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which
addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the
simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We
test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from
astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a
data-driven manner without adopting tunable hyperparameters or priors governing
the misspecification.

Conclusion: 提出的方差驱动EWMA时变Hurst参数rough Bergomi模型提供了数学可处理性和对波动率状态变化的适应性，为粗糙波动率建模提供了新的有效框架。

Abstract: We introduce a novel rough Bergomi (rBergomi) model featuring a

Hurst parameter $H_t$, fundamentally distinct from recent machine learning and
wavelet-based approaches in the literature. Our framework pioneers a unified
rough differential equation (RDE) formulation grounded in rough path theory,
where the Hurst parameter dynamically adapts to evolving volatility regimes
through a continuous EWMA mechanism tied to instantaneous variance. Unlike
discrete model-switching or computationally intensive forecasting methods, our
approach provides mathematical tractability while capturing volatility
clustering and roughness bursts. We rigorously establish existence and
uniqueness of solutions via rough path theory and derive martingale properties.
Empirical validation on diverse asset classes including equities,
cryptocurrencies, and commodities demonstrates superior performance in
capturing dynamics and out-of-sample pricing accuracy. Our results show
significant improvements over traditional constant-Hurst models.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to graph drawing based on reinforcement learning
for minimizing the global and the local crossing number, that is, the total
number of edge crossings and the maximum number of crossings on any edge,
respectively. In our framework, an agent learns how to move a vertex based on a
given observation vector in order to optimize its position. The agent receives
feedback in the form of local reward signals tied to crossing reduction. To
generate an initial layout, we use a stress-based graph-drawing algorithm. We
compare our method against force- and stress-based (baseline) algorithms as
well as three established algorithms for global crossing minimization on a
suite of benchmark graphs. The experiments show mixed results: our current
algorithm is mainly competitive for the local crossing number. We see a
potential for further development of the approach in the future.

Abstract: Ranking and selection (R&S) aims to identify the alternative with the best
mean performance among $k$ simulated alternatives. The practical value of R&S
depends on accurate simulation input modeling, which often suffers from the
curse of input uncertainty due to limited data. Distributionally robust ranking
and selection (DRR&S) addresses this challenge by modeling input uncertainty
via an ambiguity set of $m > 1$ plausible input distributions, resulting in
$km$ scenarios in total. Recent DRR&S studies suggest a key structural insight:
additivity in budget allocation is essential for efficiency. However, existing
justifications are heuristic, and fundamental properties such as consistency
and the precise allocation pattern induced by additivity remain poorly
understood. In this paper, we propose a simple additive allocation (AA)
procedure that aims to exclusively sample the $k + m - 1$ previously
hypothesized critical scenarios. Leveraging boundary-crossing arguments, we
establish a lower bound on the probability of correct selection and
characterize the procedure's budget allocation behavior. We then prove that AA
is consistent and, surprisingly, achieves additivity in the strongest sense: as
the total budget increases, only $k + m - 1$ scenarios are sampled infinitely
often. Notably, the worst-case scenarios of non-best alternatives may not be
among them, challenging prior beliefs about their criticality. These results
offer new and counterintuitive insights into the additive structure of DRR&S.
To improve practical performance while preserving this structure, we introduce
a general additive allocation (GAA) framework that flexibly incorporates
sampling rules from traditional R&S procedures in a modular fashion. Numerical
experiments support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the competitive
performance of the proposed GAA procedures.

Motivation: 快速射电暴(FRB)的天体物理起源尚不明确，区分重复爆发源和非重复爆发源对于理解其物理机制至关重要。传统方法可能无法充分捕捉FRB的复杂形态特征，需要利用深度学习来自动提取和分类这些特征。

Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to classify fast radio bursts (FRBs)
based purely on morphology as encoded on recorded dynamic spectrum from
CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We implemented transfer learning with a pretrained
ConvNext architecture, exploiting its powerful feature extraction ability.
ConvNext was adapted to classify dedispersed dynamic spectra (which we treat as
images) of the FRBs into one of the two sub-classes, i.e., repeater and
non-repeater, based on their various temporal and spectral properties and
relation between the sub-pulse structures. Additionally, we also used
mathematical model representation of the total intensity data to interpret the
deep learning model. Upon fine-tuning the pretrained ConvNext on the FRB
spectrograms, we were able to achieve high classification metrics while
substantially reducing training time and computing power as compared to
training a deep learning model from scratch with random weights and biases
without any feature extraction ability. Importantly, our results suggest that
the morphological differences between CHIME repeating and non-repeating events
persist in Catalog 2 and the deep learning model leveraged these differences
for classification. The fine-tuned deep learning model can be used for
inference, which enables us to predict whether an FRB's morphology resembles
that of repeaters or non-repeaters. Such inferences may become increasingly
significant when trained on larger data sets that will exist in the near
future.

Abstract: We propose a new inference framework, named MOSAIC, for change-point

structure. We establish the minimax rate of detection boundary, which relies on
the sparsity of changes. We then develop an eigen-decomposition-based test with
screened signals that approaches the minimax rate in theory, with only a minor
logarithmic loss. For practical implementation of MOSAIC, we adjust the
theoretical test by a novel residual-based technique, resulting in a pivotal
statistic that converges to a standard normal distribution via the martingale
central limit theorem under the null hypothesis and achieves full power under
the alternative hypothesis. We also analyze the minimax rate of testing
boundary for dynamic networks without the low-rank structure, which almost
aligns with the results in high-dimensional mean-vector change-point inference.
We showcase the effectiveness of MOSAIC and verify our theoretical results with

Abstract: This paper studies high-dimensional additive regression under the transfer
learning framework, where one observes samples from a target population
together with auxiliary samples from different but potentially related
regression models. We first introduce a target-only estimation procedure based
on the smooth backfitting estimator with local linear smoothing. In contrast to
previous work, we establish general error bounds under sub-Weibull($\alpha$)
noise, thereby accommodating heavy-tailed error distributions. In the
sub-exponential case ($\alpha=1$), we show that the estimator attains the
minimax lower bound under regularity conditions, which requires a substantial
departure from existing proof strategies. We then develop a novel two-stage
estimation method within a transfer learning framework, and provide theoretical
guarantees at both the population and empirical levels. Error bounds are
derived for each stage under general tail conditions, and we further
demonstrate that the minimax optimal rate is achieved when the auxiliary and
target distributions are sufficiently close. All theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and real data analysis.

Abstract: In subjective assessment of image and video quality, observers rate or
compare selected stimuli. Before calculating the mean opinion scores (MOS) for
these stimuli from the ratings, it is recommended to identify and deal with
outliers that may have given unreliable ratings. Several methods are available
for this purpose, some of which have been standardized. These methods are
typically based on statistics and sometimes tested by introducing synthetic
ratings from artificial outliers, such as random clickers. However, a reliable
and comprehensive approach is lacking for comparative performance analysis of
outlier detection methods. To fill this gap, this work proposes and applies an
empirical worst-case analysis as a general solution. Our method involves
evolutionary optimization of an adversarial black-box attack on outlier
detection algorithms, where the adversary maximizes the distortion of scale
values with respect to ground truth. We apply our analysis to several hard and
soft outlier detection methods for absolute category ratings and show their
differing performance in this stress test. In addition, we propose two new
outlier detection methods with low complexity and excellent worst-case
performance. Software for adversarial attacks and data analysis is available.

Abstract: In this paper, a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework is proposed
for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent
surface (STAR-RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO broadcasting systems.
Motivated by the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability in future 6G
networks, this work adopts a broadcasting transmission architecture for
scenarios where multiple users share identical information, improving spectral
efficiency and reducing redundant transmissions and power consumption.
Different from conventional optimization methods, such as block coordinate
descent (BCD) that require perfect channel state information (CSI) and
iterative computation, the proposed GL framework operates directly on received
uplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. Unlike deep learning (DL)
approaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach
also avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more
lightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with
supervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully
CSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with
adjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature
selection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to
jointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation
results show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral
efficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point
operations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the
proposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and
hardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios.

Abstract: The excess Gibbs energy plays a central role in chemical engineering and
chemistry, providing a basis for modeling the thermodynamic properties of
liquid mixtures. Predicting the excess Gibbs energy of multi-component mixtures
solely from the molecular structures of their components is a long-standing
challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating physical laws
as hard constraints within a flexible neural network. The resulting model,
HANNA, was trained end-to-end on an extensive experimental dataset for binary
mixtures from the Dortmund Data Bank, guaranteeing thermodynamically consistent
predictions. A novel surrogate solver developed in this work enabled the
inclusion of liquid-liquid equilibrium data in the training process.
Furthermore, a geometric projection method was applied to enable robust
extrapolations to multi-component mixtures, without requiring additional
parameters. We demonstrate that HANNA delivers excellent predictions, clearly
outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark methods in accuracy and scope. The
trained model and corresponding code are openly available, and an interactive
interface is provided on our website, MLPROP.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个综合风险评分系统来分析尼日利亚各州对COVID-19的脆弱性，基于人口密度、贫困率、医疗可及性和年龄风险等因素，并通过GIS识别高风险热点地区。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行对尼日利亚公共卫生系统造成重大挑战，需要识别最脆弱的地区以有效分配有限的医疗资源。

Method: 构建综合风险评分系统（权重：贫困0.4、医疗可及性0.3、人口密度0.2、年龄风险0.1），结合GIS地理信息系统进行热点分析，并使用Google Trends数据补充分析公共卫生意识。

Result: 发现高密度城市地区（如拉各斯）风险评分最高（673.47 vs 全国平均28.16），拉各斯占全国病例的35.4%。结果与国际框架（如CDC社会脆弱性指数）一致。

Conclusion: 该风险评分可为政策制定者提供优先分配测试、疫苗和医疗资源的工具，但数据缺口和农村地区报告不足需要进一步研究。该框架可扩展到其他传染病。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges in Nigeria's
public health systems since the first case reported on February 27, 2020. This
study investigates key factors that contribute to state vulnerability,
quantifying them through a composite risk score integrating population density
(weight 0.2), poverty (0.4), access to healthcare (0.3), and age risk (0.1),
adjusted by normalized case rates per 100,000. States were categorized into
low-, medium-, and high-density areas to analyze trends and identify hotspots
using geographic information system (GIS) mapping. The findings reveal that
high-density urban areas, such as Lagos, accounting for 35.4% of national
cases, had the highest risk scores (Lagos: 673.47 vs. national average: 28.16).
These results align with global and local studies on the spatial variability of
COVID-19 in Nigeria, including international frameworks such as the CDC Social
Vulnerability Index. Google Trends data highlight variations in public health
awareness, serving as a supplementary analysis to contextualize vulnerability.
The risk score provides a prioritization tool for policymakers to allocate
testing, vaccines, and healthcare resources to high-risk areas, though data
gaps and rural underreporting call for further research. This framework can
extend to other infectious diseases, offering lessons for future pandemics in
resource-limited settings.

Abstract: We prove that the detection rate of n-crossing alternating links by link
invariants insensitive to oriented mutation decays exponentially in n, implying
that they detect alternating links with probability zero. This phenomenon
applies broadly, in particular to quantum invariants such as the Jones or
HOMFLYPT polynomials. We also use a big data approach to analyze several
borderline cases (e.g. integral Khovanov or HOMFLYPT homologies), where our
arguments almost, but not quite, apply, and we provide evidence that they too
exhibit the same asymptotic behavior.
