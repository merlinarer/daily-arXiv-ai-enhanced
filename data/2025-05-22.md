Motivation: 探索预训练过程中多语言事实记忆和跨语言一致性的发展，填补现有研究仅关注最终模型的空白。

Method: 以OLMo-7B为案例，追踪预训练过程中事实记忆和跨语言一致性的变化，分析频率和跨语言迁移的影响。

Result: 事实记忆和跨语言一致性随时间提升，主要受语料中事实频率驱动；跨语言迁移在早期显著，但对命名实体类关系有限。

Conclusion: 多语言事实获取通过频率驱动（主）和跨语言迁移（辅）两种途径实现，后者对命名实体类关系更有效。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of recalling multilingual factual
knowledge present in their pretraining data. However, most studies evaluate
only the final model, leaving the development of factual recall and
crosslingual consistency throughout pretraining largely unexplored. In this
work, we trace how factual recall and crosslingual consistency evolve during
pretraining, focusing on OLMo-7B as a case study. We find that both accuracy
and consistency improve over time for most languages. We show that this
improvement is primarily driven by the fact frequency in the pretraining
corpus: more frequent facts are more likely to be recalled correctly,
regardless of language. Yet, some low-frequency facts in non-English languages
can still be correctly recalled. Our analysis reveals that these instances
largely benefit from crosslingual transfer of their English counterparts -- an
effect that emerges predominantly in the early stages of pretraining. We
pinpoint two distinct pathways through which multilingual factual knowledge
acquisition occurs: (1) frequency-driven learning, which is dominant and
language-agnostic, and (2) crosslingual transfer, which is limited in scale and
typically constrained to relation types involving named entities. We release
our code and data to facilitate further research at

Conclusion: DISCO有效解决了GRPO的局限性，提升了多域不平衡数据下的泛化和公平性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences
through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods,
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its
simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned
value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution
and uniform semantic alignment across groups - assumptions that rarely hold in
real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO
disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented
ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose
Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled
extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key
innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by
reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward
scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize
uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies
promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that
DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on
Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment
benchmarks.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly advance, we introduce Hunyuan-TurboS,
a novel large hybrid Transformer-Mamba Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. It
synergistically combines Mamba's long-sequence processing efficiency with
Transformer's superior contextual understanding. Hunyuan-TurboS features an
adaptive long-short chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism, dynamically switching
between rapid responses for simple queries and deep "thinking" modes for
complex problems, optimizing computational resources. Architecturally, this 56B
activated (560B total) parameter model employs 128 layers (Mamba2, Attention,
FFN) with an innovative AMF/MF block pattern. Faster Mamba2 ensures linear
complexity, Grouped-Query Attention minimizes KV cache, and FFNs use an MoE
structure. Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context
length and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our
comprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised
Fine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method,
Multi-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage
Large-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general
instruction-following. Evaluations show strong performance: overall top 7 rank
on LMSYS Chatbot Arena with a score of 1356, outperforming leading models like
Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 (1352) and o4-mini-2025-04-16 (1345). TurboS also achieves
an average of 77.9% across 23 automated benchmarks. Hunyuan-TurboS balances
high performance and efficiency, offering substantial capabilities at lower
inference costs than many reasoning models, establishing a new paradigm for
efficient large-scale pre-trained models.

Result: Qwen-RLPA在个性化对话中超越现有基线及商业模型，表现高效且稳健。

Conclusion: 动态用户画像推断是构建个性化对话系统的有效范式。

Abstract: Personalized alignment is essential for enabling large language models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric dialogue. While recent prompt-based and
offline optimization methods offer preliminary solutions, they fall short in
cold-start scenarios and long-term personalization due to their inherently
static and shallow designs. In this work, we introduce the Reinforcement
Learning for Personalized Alignment (RLPA) framework, in which an LLM interacts
with a simulated user model to iteratively infer and refine user profiles
through dialogue. The training process is guided by a dual-level reward
structure: the Profile Reward encourages accurate construction of user
representations, while the Response Reward incentivizes generation of responses
consistent with the inferred profile. We instantiate RLPA by fine-tuning
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, resulting in Qwen-RLPA, which achieves state-of-the-art
performance in personalized dialogue. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
Qwen-RLPA consistently outperforms prompting and offline fine-tuning baselines,
and even surpasses advanced commercial models such as Claude-3.5 and GPT-4o.
Further analysis highlights Qwen-RLPA's robustness in reconciling conflicting
user preferences, sustaining long-term personalization and delivering more
efficient inference compared to recent reasoning-focused LLMs. These results
emphasize the potential of dynamic profile inference as a more effective
paradigm for building personalized dialogue systems.

Conclusion: CoLA是一种高效且鲁棒的参数高效微调方法，适用于多任务和低样本场景。

Abstract: The scaling law of Large Language Models (LLMs) reveals a power-law
relationship, showing diminishing return on performance as model scale
increases. While training LLMs from scratch is resource-intensive, fine-tuning
a pre-trained model for specific tasks has become a practical alternative. Full
fine-tuning (FFT) achieves strong performance; however, it is computationally
expensive and inefficient. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, like
LoRA, have been proposed to address these challenges by freezing the
pre-trained model and adding lightweight task-specific modules. LoRA, in
particular, has proven effective, but its application to multi-task scenarios
is limited by interference between tasks. Recent approaches, such as
Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) and asymmetric LoRA, have aimed to mitigate these
issues but still struggle with sample scarcity and noise interference due to
their fixed structure. In response, we propose CoLA, a more flexible LoRA
architecture with an efficient initialization scheme, and introduces three
collaborative strategies to enhance performance by better utilizing the
quantitative relationships between matrices $A$ and $B$. Our experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of CoLA, outperforming existing
PEFT methods, especially in low-sample scenarios. Our data and code are fully

Conclusion: BiasLens为LLMs的偏差发现提供了可扩展、可解释且高效的解决方案，有助于提升公平性和透明度。

Abstract: Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly undermines their
reliability and fairness. We focus on a common form of bias: when two reference
concepts in the model's concept space, such as sentiment polarities (e.g.,
"positive" and "negative"), are asymmetrically correlated with a third, target
concept, such as a reviewing aspect, the model exhibits unintended bias. For
instance, the understanding of "food" should not skew toward any particular
sentiment. Existing bias evaluation methods assess behavioral differences of
LLMs by constructing labeled data for different social groups and measuring
model responses across them, a process that requires substantial human effort
and captures only a limited set of social concepts. To overcome these
limitations, we propose BiasLens, a test-set-free bias analysis framework based
on the structure of the model's vector space. BiasLens combines Concept
Activation Vectors (CAVs) with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract
interpretable concept representations, and quantifies bias by measuring the
variation in representational similarity between the target concept and each of
the reference concepts. Even without labeled data, BiasLens shows strong
agreement with traditional bias evaluation metrics (Spearman correlation r >
0.85). Moreover, BiasLens reveals forms of bias that are difficult to detect
using existing methods. For example, in simulated clinical scenarios, a
patient's insurance status can cause the LLM to produce biased diagnostic
assessments. Overall, BiasLens offers a scalable, interpretable, and efficient
paradigm for bias discovery, paving the way for improving fairness and
transparency in LLMs.

Abstract: Private data is typically larger and of higher quality than public data,
offering great potential to improve LLM. However, its scattered distribution
across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their
deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based
split learning model has emerged, offloading most model parameters to the
server while retaining only the embedding and output layers on clients to
ensure privacy. However, it still faces significant challenges in security,
efficiency, and adaptability: 1) embedding gradients are vulnerable to attacks,
leading to reverse engineering of private data; 2) the autoregressive nature of
LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially,
causing high communication overhead; 3) fixed partition points lack
adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FL-LLaMA, a
secure, efficient, and adaptive federated split framework based on LLaMA2.
First, we place some input and output blocks on the local client and inject
Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states, enabling secure end-to-end
propagation. Second, we employ client-batch and server-hierarchical strategies
to achieve parallel training, along with attention-mask compression and KV
cache mechanisms to accelerate inference, reducing communication costs
effectively. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points
for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements and hardware
limitations. Experiments on NLU, summarization and conversational QA tasks show
that FL-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2, and
achieves up to 2x train speedups and 8x inference speedups. Further analysis of
privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the
effectiveness of FL-LLaMA in security and adaptability.

Abstract: Instruction-following is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with user intent. While recent reasoning-oriented models exhibit impressive
performance on complex mathematical problems, their ability to adhere to
natural language instructions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
MathIF, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating instruction-following in
mathematical reasoning tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals a consistent
tension between scaling up reasoning capacity and maintaining controllability,
as models that reason more effectively often struggle to comply with user
directives. We find that models tuned on distilled long chains-of-thought or
trained with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning often degrade in
instruction adherence, especially when generation length increases.
Furthermore, we show that even simple interventions can partially recover
obedience, though at the cost of reasoning performance. These findings
highlight a fundamental tension in current LLM training paradigms and motivate
the need for more instruction-aware reasoning models. We release the code and

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) excel at complex tasks by leveraging a
chain-of-thought process to generate structured intermediate steps. However,
language mixing, i.e., reasoning steps containing tokens from languages other
than the prompt, has been observed in their outputs and shown to affect
performance, though its impact remains debated. We present the first systematic
study of language mixing in RLMs, examining its patterns, impact, and internal
causes across 15 languages, 7 task difficulty levels, and 18 subject areas, and
show how all three factors influence language mixing. Moreover, we demonstrate
that the choice of reasoning language significantly affects performance:
forcing models to reason in Latin or Han scripts via constrained decoding
notably improves accuracy. Finally, we show that the script composition of
reasoning traces closely aligns with that of the model's internal
representations, indicating that language mixing reflects latent processing
preferences in RLMs. Our findings provide actionable insights for optimizing
multilingual reasoning and open new directions for controlling reasoning
languages to build more interpretable and adaptable RLMs.

Conclusion: MoI是一种高效且无需训练的方法，能显著提升LLM的生成质量和推理能力。

Abstract: In standard autoregressive generation, an LLM predicts the next-token
distribution, samples a discrete token, and then discards the distribution,
passing only the sampled token as new input. To preserve this distribution's
rich information, we propose Mixture of Inputs (MoI), a training-free method
for autoregressive generation. After generating a token following the standard
paradigm, we construct a new input that blends the generated discrete token
with the previously discarded token distribution. Specifically, we employ a
Bayesian estimation method that treats the token distribution as the prior, the
sampled token as the observation, and replaces the conventional one-hot vector
with the continuous posterior expectation as the new model input. MoI allows
the model to maintain a richer internal representation throughout the
generation process, resulting in improved text quality and reasoning
capabilities. On mathematical reasoning, code generation, and PhD-level QA
tasks, MoI consistently improves performance across multiple models including
QwQ-32B, Nemotron-Super-49B, Gemma-3-27B, and DAPO-Qwen-32B, with no additional

Conclusion: SEPS框架和MP策略解决了现有遗忘方法的局限性，为LLMs的选择性遗忘提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove targeted knowledge from Large
Language Models (LLMs), ensuring they forget specified content while retaining
essential information. Existing unlearning metrics assess whether a model
correctly answers retain queries and rejects forget queries, but they fail to
capture real-world scenarios where forget queries rarely appear in isolation.
In fact, forget and retain queries often coexist within the same prompt, making
mixed-query evaluation crucial.
  We introduce SEPS, an evaluation framework that explicitly measures a model's
ability to both forget and retain information within a single prompt. Through
extensive experiments across three benchmarks, we identify two key failure
modes in existing unlearning methods: (1) untargeted unlearning
indiscriminately erases both forget and retain content once a forget query
appears, and (2) targeted unlearning overfits to single-query scenarios,
leading to catastrophic failures when handling multiple queries. To address
these issues, we propose Mixed Prompt (MP) unlearning, a strategy that
integrates both forget and retain queries into a unified training objective.
Our approach significantly improves unlearning effectiveness, demonstrating
robustness even in complex settings with up to eight mixed forget and retain
queries in a single prompt.

<details>

Motivation: 预训练LLMs的高秩特性及缺乏预训练数据访问权，使得其在下游任务中的压缩具有挑战性。

Method: 采用低秩张量压缩技术（如张量链网络）并结合稀疏增强张量网络（Saten）进行微调。

Result: Saten在张量化语言模型中实现了最先进的性能，提升了压缩效率和准确性。

Conclusion: Saten框架为资源受限设备上的LLMs高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The efficient implementation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Low-rank tensor compression
techniques, such as tensor-train (TT) networks, have been widely studied for
over-parameterized neural networks. However, their applications to compress
pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks (post-training)
remains challenging due to the high-rank nature of pre-trained LLMs and the
lack of access to pretraining data. In this study, we investigate low-rank
tensorized LLMs during fine-tuning and propose sparse augmented tensor networks
(Saten) to enhance their performance. The proposed Saten framework enables full
model compression. Experimental results demonstrate that Saten enhances both
accuracy and compression efficiency in tensorized language models, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在多种任务中表现优异，但其性能高度依赖提示策略，而现有评估多关注性能而非效率。作者认为效率（性能与token使用的平衡）更具实际意义。

Method: 提出Big-$O_{tok}$理论框架描述提示策略的token使用增长，并引入Token Cost作为性能与token使用的实证指标。分析了多种常见提示策略。

Result: 研究发现，增加token使用会导致性能回报急剧下降，验证了Big-$O_{tok}$框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 效率感知的评估对实际应用至关重要，Big-$O_{tok}$和Token Cost为提示策略的优化提供了实用工具。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models have demonstrated remarkable
performance across diverse tasks. However, their task effectiveness is heavily
dependent on the prompting strategy used to elicit output, which can vary
widely in both performance and token usage. While task performance is often
used to determine prompting strategy success, we argue that
efficiency--balancing performance and token usage--can be a more practical
metric for real-world utility. To enable this, we propose Big-$O_{tok}$, a
theoretical framework for describing the token usage growth of prompting
strategies, and analyze Token Cost, an empirical measure of tokens per
performance. We apply these to several common prompting strategies and find
that increased token usage leads to drastically diminishing performance
returns. Our results validate the Big-$O_{tok}$ analyses and reinforce the need
for efficiency-aware evaluations.

Motivation: 理解LLMs在建模状态转换动态方面的能力，尤其是在确定性状态动态任务中的表现。

Method: 在三个领域（Box Tracking、Abstract DFA Sequences、Complex Text Games）评估LLMs的状态预测准确性，并通过激活修补技术识别关键注意力头。

Result: GPT-2 XL和Pythia-1B在复杂状态下的准确性显著下降，且状态-动作联合推理能力较弱。

Conclusion: LLMs的状态跟踪能力源于分布式交互而非显式符号计算。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in tasks requiring
internal state tracking, yet their ability to model state transition dynamics
remains poorly understood. We evaluate how well LLMs capture deterministic
state dynamics across 3 domains: Box Tracking, Abstract DFA Sequences, and
Complex Text Games, each formalizable as a finite-state system. Across tasks,
we find that next-state prediction accuracy degrades with increasing
state-space size and sparse transitions. GPT-2 XL reaches about 70% accuracy in
low-complexity settings but drops below 30% when the number of boxes or states
exceeds 5 or 10, respectively. In DFA tasks, Pythia-1B fails to exceed 50%
accuracy when the number of states is > 10 and transitions are < 30. Through
activation patching, we identify attention heads responsible for propagating
state information: GPT-2 XL Layer 22 Head 20, and Pythia-1B Heads at Layers 10,
11, 12, and 14. While these heads successfully move relevant state features,
action information is not reliably routed to the final token, indicating weak
joint state-action reasoning. Our results suggest that state tracking in LLMs
emerges from distributed interactions of next-token heads rather than explicit
symbolic computation.

Result: 模型在角色扮演中无法正确识别“死亡”状态，导致行为不一致和准确性下降。

Conclusion: 概念不一致性会导致模型行为异常，未来需改进模型在此类情况下的表现。

Abstract: Consider this prompt "Draw a unicorn with two horns". Should large language
models (LLMs) recognize that a unicorn has only one horn by definition and ask
users for clarifications, or proceed to generate something anyway? We introduce
concept incongruence to capture such phenomena where concept boundaries clash
with each other, either in user prompts or in model representations, often
leading to under-specified or mis-specified behaviors. In this work, we take
the first step towards defining and analyzing model behavior under concept
incongruence. Focusing on temporal boundaries in the Role-Play setting, we
propose three behavioral metrics--abstention rate, conditional accuracy, and
answer rate--to quantify model behavior under incongruence due to the role's
death. We show that models fail to abstain after death and suffer from an
accuracy drop compared to the Non-Role-Play setting. Through probing
experiments, we identify two main causes: (i) unreliable encoding of the
"death" state across different years, leading to unsatisfactory abstention
behavior, and (ii) role playing causes shifts in the model's temporal
representations, resulting in accuracy drops. We leverage these insights to
improve consistency in the model's abstention and answer behaviors. Our
findings suggest that concept incongruence leads to unexpected model behaviors
and point to future directions on improving model behavior under concept
incongruence.

Result: ConspEmoLLM-v2在原始人类文本上表现相当或更好，在情感伪装内容上显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 通过增强数据集和模型，能有效检测LLM生成的伪装阴谋论内容。

Abstract: Despite the many benefits of large language models (LLMs), they can also
cause harm, e.g., through automatic generation of misinformation, including
conspiracy theories. Moreover, LLMs can also ''disguise'' conspiracy theories
by altering characteristic textual features, e.g., by transforming their
typically strong negative emotions into a more positive tone. Although several
studies have proposed automated conspiracy theory detection methods, they are
usually trained using human-authored text, whose features can vary from
LLM-generated text. Furthermore, several conspiracy detection models, including
the previously proposed ConspEmoLLM, rely heavily on the typical emotional
features of human-authored conspiracy content. As such, intentionally disguised
content may evade detection. To combat such issues, we firstly developed an
augmented version of the ConDID conspiracy detection dataset, ConDID-v2, which
supplements human-authored conspiracy tweets with versions rewritten by an LLM
to reduce the negativity of their original sentiment. The quality of the
rewritten tweets was verified by combining human and LLM-based assessment. We
subsequently used ConDID-v2 to train ConspEmoLLM-v2, an enhanced version of
ConspEmoLLM. Experimental results demonstrate that ConspEmoLLM-v2 retains or
exceeds the performance of ConspEmoLLM on the original human-authored content
in ConDID, and considerably outperforms both ConspEmoLLM and several other
baselines when applied to sentiment-transformed tweets in ConDID-v2. The
project will be available at https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM.

and evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability. Our case study examines
financial news sentiment classification across 14 LLMs (including
claude-3-7-sonnet, gpt-4o, deepseek-r1, gemma3, llama3.2, phi4, and

Abstract: Although the context length of large language models (LLMs) has increased to
millions of tokens, evaluating their effectiveness beyond needle-in-a-haystack
approaches has proven difficult. We argue that novels provide a case study of
subtle, complicated structure and long-range semantic dependencies often over
128k tokens in length. Inspired by work on computational novel analysis, we
release the Too Long, Didn't Model (TLDM) benchmark, which tests a model's
ability to report plot summary, storyworld configuration, and elapsed narrative
time. We find that none of seven tested frontier LLMs retain stable
understanding beyond 64k tokens. Our results suggest language model developers
must look beyond "lost in the middle" benchmarks when evaluating model
performance in complex long-context scenarios. To aid in further development we
release the TLDM benchmark together with reference code and data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing (NLP) and expanded their applications across
diverse domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have been
shown to reflect and perpetuate harmful societal biases, including those based
on ethnicity, gender, and religion. A critical and underexplored issue is the
reinforcement of caste-based biases, particularly towards India's marginalized
caste groups such as Dalits and Shudras. In this paper, we address this gap by
proposing DECASTE, a novel, multi-dimensional framework designed to detect and
assess both implicit and explicit caste biases in LLMs. Our approach evaluates
caste fairness across four dimensions: socio-cultural, economic, educational,
and political, using a range of customized prompting strategies. By
benchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal that these models
systematically reinforce caste biases, with significant disparities observed in
the treatment of oppressed versus dominant caste groups. For example, bias
scores are notably elevated when comparing Dalits and Shudras with dominant
caste groups, reflecting societal prejudices that persist in model outputs.
These results expose the subtle yet pervasive caste biases in LLMs and
emphasize the need for more comprehensive and inclusive bias evaluation
methodologies that assess the potential risks of deploying such models in
real-world contexts.

Conclusion: 元级自监督设计为高效、自适应MAS提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) leveraging the impressive capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for tackling complex tasks.
However, most current MAS depend on manually designed agent roles and
communication protocols. These manual designs often fail to align with the
underlying LLMs' strengths and struggle to adapt to novel tasks. Recent
automatic MAS approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations but typically
necessitate a validation-set for tuning and yield static MAS designs lacking
adaptability during inference. We introduce SELF-MAS, the first
self-supervised, inference-time only framework for automatic MAS design.
SELF-MAS employs meta-level design to iteratively generate, evaluate, and
refine MAS configurations tailored to each problem instance, without requiring
a validation set. Critically, it enables dynamic agent composition and problem
decomposition through meta-feedback on solvability and completeness.
Experiments across math, graduate-level QA, and software engineering
benchmarks, using both closed-source and open-source LLM back-bones of varying
sizes, demonstrate that SELF-MAS outperforms both manual and automatic MAS
baselines, achieving a 7.44% average accuracy improvement over the next
strongest baseline while maintaining cost-efficiency. These findings underscore
the promise of meta-level self-supervised design for creating effective and
adaptive MAS.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based embedding models, benefiting from large
scale pre-training and post-training, have begun to surpass BERT and T5-based
models on general-purpose text embedding tasks such as document retrieval.
However, a fundamental limitation of LLM embeddings lies in the unidirectional
attention used during autoregressive pre-training, which misaligns with the
bidirectional nature of text embedding tasks. To this end, We propose adopting
diffusion language models for text embeddings, motivated by their inherent
bidirectional architecture and recent success in matching or surpassing LLMs
especially on reasoning tasks. We present the first systematic study of the
diffusion language embedding model, which outperforms the LLM-based embedding
model by 20% on long-document retrieval, 8% on reasoning-intensive retrieval,
2% on instruction-following retrieval, and achieve competitive performance on
traditional text embedding benchmarks. Our analysis verifies that bidirectional
attention is crucial for encoding global context in long and complex text.

Abstract: When addressing complex questions that require new information, people often
associate the question with existing knowledge to derive a sensible answer. For
instance, when evaluating whether melatonin aids insomnia, one might associate
"hormones helping mental disorders" with "melatonin being a hormone and
insomnia a mental disorder" to complete the reasoning. Large Language Models
(LLMs) also require such associative thinking, particularly in resolving
scientific inquiries when retrieved knowledge is insufficient and does not
directly answer the question. Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE)
addresses this by using a knowledge graph (KG) to extrapolate structured
knowledge. However, it involves the construction and pruning of many
hypothetical triplets, which limits efficiency and generalizability. We propose
Self-GIVE, a retrieve-RL framework that enhances LLMs with automatic
associative thinking through reinforcement learning. Self-GIVE extracts
structured information and entity sets to assist the model in linking to the
queried concepts. We address GIVE's key limitations: (1) extensive LLM calls
and token overhead for knowledge extrapolation, (2) difficulty in deploying on
smaller LLMs (3B or 7B) due to complex instructions, and (3) inaccurate
knowledge from LLM pruning. Specifically, after fine-tuning using self-GIVE
with a 135 node UMLS KG, it improves the performance of the Qwen2.5 3B and 7B
models by up to $\textbf{28.5%$\rightarrow$71.4%}$ and
$\textbf{78.6$\rightarrow$90.5%}$ in samples $\textbf{unseen}$ in challenging
biomedical QA tasks. In particular, Self-GIVE allows the 7B model to match or
outperform GPT3.5 turbo with GIVE, while cutting token usage by over 90\%.
Self-GIVE enhances the scalable integration of structured retrieval and

Conclusion: 不同架构在机制上存在实质性差异，即使性能相似，因此需要采用机制性评估方法。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) for language modelling promise an efficient and
performant alternative to quadratic-attention Transformers, yet show variable
performance on recalling basic information from the context. While performance
on synthetic tasks like Associative Recall (AR) can point to this deficiency,
behavioural metrics provide little information as to why--on a mechanistic
level--certain architectures fail and others succeed. To address this, we
conduct experiments on AR and find that only Transformers and Based SSM models
fully succeed at AR, with Mamba a close third, whereas the other SSMs (H3,
Hyena) fail. We then use causal interventions to explain why. We find that
Transformers and Based learn to store key-value associations in-context using
induction heads. By contrast, the SSMs compute these associations only at the
last state, with only Mamba succeeding because of its short convolution
component. To extend and deepen these findings, we introduce Associative
Treecall (ATR), a synthetic task similar to AR based on PCFG induction. ATR
introduces language-like hierarchical structure into the AR setting. We find
that all architectures learn the same mechanism as they did for AR, and the
same three models succeed at the task. These results reveal that architectures
with similar accuracy may still have substantive differences, motivating the
adoption of mechanistic evaluations.

Conclusion: 细粒度的逐步监督能有效优化深度搜索LLM。

Abstract: Efficient multi-hop reasoning requires Large Language Models (LLMs) based
agents to acquire high-value external knowledge iteratively. Previous work has
explored reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to perform search-based
document retrieval, achieving notable improvements in QA performance, but
underperform on complex, multi-hop QA resulting from the sparse rewards from
global signal only. To address this gap in existing research, we introduce
StepSearch, a framework for search LLMs that trained with step-wise proximal
policy optimization method. It consists of richer and more detailed
intermediate search rewards and token-level process supervision based on
information gain and redundancy penalties to better guide each search step. We
constructed a fine-grained question-answering dataset containing
sub-question-level search trajectories based on open source datasets through a
set of data pipeline method. On standard multi-hop QA benchmarks, it
significantly outperforms global-reward baselines, achieving 11.2% and 4.2%
absolute improvements for 3B and 7B models over various search with RL
baselines using only 19k training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision in optimizing deep search LLMs. Our
implementation is publicly available at

Motivation: 长链思维（Long CoT）在表格推理任务中成本高且可靠性低，因此需要一种更高效、可靠的方法。

Result: RoT在非推理模型上平均优于RLLMs 4.3%，在WikiTableQuestions和TableBench上达到SOTA，且效率更高。

Conclusion: RoT是一种高效、可靠的表格推理方法，显著减少幻觉问题，性能优于现有技术。

Abstract: The table reasoning task, crucial for efficient data acquisition, aims to
answer questions based on the given table. Recently, reasoning large language
models (RLLMs) with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) significantly enhance
reasoning capabilities, leading to brilliant performance on table reasoning.
However, Long CoT suffers from high cost for training and exhibits low
reliability due to table content hallucinations. Therefore, we propose
Row-of-Thought (RoT), which performs iteratively row-wise table traversal,
allowing for reasoning extension and reflection-based refinement at each
traversal. Scaling reasoning length by row-wise traversal and leveraging
reflection capabilities of LLMs, RoT is training-free. The sequential traversal
encourages greater attention to the table, thus reducing hallucinations.
Experiments show that RoT, using non-reasoning models, outperforms RLLMs by an
average of 4.3%, and achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiTableQuestions
and TableBench with comparable models, proving its effectiveness. Also, RoT
outperforms Long CoT with fewer reasoning tokens, indicating higher efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated strong potential in training
large language models (LLMs) capable of complex reasoning for real-world
problem solving. More recently, RL has been leveraged to create sophisticated
LLM-based search agents that adeptly combine reasoning with search engine use.
While the use of RL for training search agents is promising, the optimal design
of such agents remains not fully understood. In particular, key factors -- such
as (1) reward formulation, (2) the choice and characteristics of the underlying
LLM, and (3) the role of the search engine in the RL process -- require further
investigation. In this work, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to
systematically investigate these and offer actionable insights. We highlight
several key findings: format rewards are effective in improving final
performance, whereas intermediate retrieval rewards have limited impact; the
scale and initialization of the LLM (general-purpose vs. reasoning-specialized)
significantly influence RL outcomes; and the choice of search engine plays a
critical role in shaping RL training dynamics and the robustness of the trained
agent during inference. These establish important guidelines for successfully
building and deploying LLM-based search agents in real-world applications. Code

Result: 实验表明，CAR在多模态VQA/KIE基准和文本推理数据集上优于简短答案和长推理方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning have significantly enhanced the capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
across diverse tasks. However, excessive reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning can impair model performance and brings unnecessarily lengthened
outputs, reducing efficiency. Our work reveals that prolonged reasoning does
not universally improve accuracy and even degrade performance on simpler tasks.
To address this, we propose Certainty-based Adaptive Reasoning (CAR), a novel
framework that dynamically switches between short answers and long-form
reasoning based on the model perplexity. CAR first generates a short answer and
evaluates its perplexity, triggering reasoning only when the model exhibits low
confidence (i.e., high perplexity). Experiments across diverse multimodal
VQA/KIE benchmarks and text reasoning datasets show that CAR outperforms both
short-answer and long-form reasoning approaches, striking an optimal balance
between accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: 强化核心推理框架是提升代理性能的关键。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM agents have largely built on reasoning backbones like
ReAct, which interleave thought and action in complex environments. However,
ReAct often produces ungrounded or incoherent reasoning steps, leading to
misalignment between the agent's actual state and goal. Our analysis finds that
this stems from ReAct's inability to maintain consistent internal beliefs and
goal alignment, causing compounding errors and hallucinations. To address this,
we introduce ReflAct, a novel backbone that shifts reasoning from merely
planning next actions to continuously reflecting on the agent's state relative
to its goal. By explicitly grounding decisions in states and enforcing ongoing
goal alignment, ReflAct dramatically improves strategic reliability. This
design delivers substantial empirical gains: ReflAct surpasses ReAct by 27.7%
on average, achieving a 93.3% success rate in ALFWorld. Notably, ReflAct even
outperforms ReAct with added enhancement modules (e.g., Reflexion, WKM),
showing that strengthening the core reasoning backbone is key to reliable agent

Conclusion: DUSK基准的发布旨在支持开发更精确可靠的遗忘技术，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, raising concerns about the unauthorized use of copyrighted or
sensitive data. Machine unlearning aims to remove such 'forget' data while
preserving utility and information from the 'retain' set. However, existing
evaluations typically assume that forget and retain sets are fully disjoint,
overlooking realistic scenarios where they share overlapping content. For
instance, a news article may need to be unlearned, even though the same event,
such as an earthquake in Japan, is also described factually on Wikipedia.
Effective unlearning should remove the specific phrasing of the news article
while preserving publicly supported facts. In this paper, we introduce DUSK, a
benchmark designed to evaluate unlearning methods under realistic data overlap.
DUSK constructs document sets that describe the same factual content in
different styles, with some shared information appearing across all sets and
other content remaining unique to each. When one set is designated for
unlearning, an ideal method should remove its unique content while preserving
shared facts. We define seven evaluation metrics to assess whether unlearning
methods can achieve this selective removal. Our evaluation of nine recent
unlearning methods reveals a key limitation: while most can remove
surface-level text, they often fail to erase deeper, context-specific knowledge
without damaging shared content. We release DUSK as a public benchmark to
support the development of more precise and reliable unlearning techniques for
real-world applications.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上取得SOTA性能，ComplexWebQuestions的Hit@1提升13%。

Conclusion: DP框架显著提升了LLM的推理和生成可靠性，具有灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation seeks to mitigate
hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) caused by insufficient or
outdated knowledge. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the
prior knowledge embedded in knowledge graphs (KGs), particularly their
structural information and explicit or implicit constraints. The former can
enhance the faithfulness of LLMs' reasoning, while the latter can improve the
reliability of response generation. Motivated by these, we propose a
trustworthy reasoning framework, termed Deliberation over Priors (DP), which
sufficiently utilizes the priors contained in KGs. Specifically, DP adopts a
progressive knowledge distillation strategy that integrates structural priors
into LLMs through a combination of supervised fine-tuning and Kahneman-Tversky
optimization, thereby improving the faithfulness of relation path generation.
Furthermore, our framework employs a reasoning-introspection strategy, which
guides LLMs to perform refined reasoning verification based on extracted
constraint priors, ensuring the reliability of response generation. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DP achieves new
state-of-the-art performance, especially a Hit@1 improvement of 13% on the
ComplexWebQuestions dataset, and generates highly trustworthy responses. We
also conduct various analyses to verify its flexibility and practicality. The

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) embed private or copyrighted information not
only in their final answers but also throughout multi-step chain-of-thought
(CoT) traces, making reliable unlearning far more demanding than in standard
LLMs. We introduce Reasoning-TOFU (R-TOFU), the first benchmark tailored to
this setting. R-TOFU augments existing unlearning tasks with realistic CoT
annotations and provides step-wise metrics that expose residual knowledge
invisible to answer-level checks. Using R-TOFU, we carry out a comprehensive
comparison of gradient-based and preference-optimization baselines and show
that conventional answer-only objectives leave substantial forget traces in
reasoning. We further propose Reasoned IDK, a preference-optimization variant
that preserves coherent yet inconclusive reasoning, achieving a stronger
balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility than earlier refusal
styles. Finally, we identify a failure mode: decoding variants such as
ZeroThink and LessThink can still reveal forgotten content despite seemingly
successful unlearning, emphasizing the need to evaluate models under diverse
decoding settings. Together, the benchmark, analysis, and new baseline
establish a systematic foundation for studying and improving unlearning in LRMs
while preserving their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to lack cultural representation and
overall diversity in their generations, from expressing opinions to answering
factual questions. To mitigate this problem, we propose multilingual prompting:
a prompting method which generates several variations of a base prompt with
added cultural and linguistic cues from several cultures, generates responses,
and then combines the results. Building on evidence that LLMs have
language-specific knowledge, multilingual prompting seeks to increase diversity
by activating a broader range of cultural knowledge embedded in model training
data. Through experiments across multiple models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA
70B, and LLaMA 8B), we show that multilingual prompting consistently
outperforms existing diversity-enhancing techniques such as high-temperature
sampling, step-by-step recall, and personas prompting. Further analyses show
that the benefits of multilingual prompting vary with language resource level
and model size, and that aligning the prompting language with the cultural cues
reduces hallucination about culturally-specific information.

capabilities in explainable temporal reasoning. Furthermore, our findings
reveal that LLMs struggle to deliver convincing explanations when relying
solely on textual information. To address challenge, we propose GETER, a novel
structure-aware generative framework that integrates Graph structures with text
for Explainable TEmporal Reasoning. Specifically, we first leverage temporal
knowledge graphs to develop a temporal encoder that captures structural
information for the query. Subsequently, we introduce a structure-text prefix
adapter to map graph structure features into the text embedding space. Finally,
LLMs generate explanation text by seamlessly integrating the soft graph token
with instruction-tuning prompt tokens. Experimental results indicate that GETER
achieves state-of-the-art performance while also demonstrating its
effectiveness as well as strong generalization capabilities. Our dataset and

Abstract: Multilingual reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language
models (LLMs), with performance disproportionately favoring high-resource
languages. Drawing inspiration from cognitive neuroscience, which suggests that
human reasoning functions largely independently of language processing, we
hypothesize that LLMs similarly encode reasoning and language as separable
components that can be disentangled to enhance multilingual reasoning. To
evaluate this, we perform a causal intervention by ablating language-specific
representations at inference time. Experiments on 10 open-source LLMs spanning
11 typologically diverse languages show that this language-specific ablation
consistently boosts multilingual reasoning performance. Layer-wise analyses
further confirm that language and reasoning representations can be effectively
decoupled throughout the model, yielding improved multilingual reasoning
capabilities, while preserving top-layer language features remains essential
for maintaining linguistic fidelity. Compared to post-training such as
supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, our training-free ablation
achieves comparable or superior results with minimal computational overhead.
These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms underlying multilingual
reasoning in LLMs and suggest a lightweight and interpretable strategy for
improving cross-lingual generalization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text generation
capabilities, including tasks like summarization, often producing coherent and
fluent outputs. However, faithfulness to source material remains a significant
challenge due to the generation of hallucinations. While extensive research
focuses on detecting and reducing these inaccuracies, less attention has been
paid to the positional distribution of hallucination within generated text,
particularly in long outputs. In this work, we investigate where hallucinations
occur in LLM-based long response generation, using long document summarization
as a key case study. Focusing on the challenging setting of long context-aware
long response generation, we find a consistent and concerning phenomenon:
hallucinations tend to concentrate disproportionately in the latter parts of
the generated long response. To understand this bias, we explore potential
contributing factors related to the dynamics of attention and decoding over
long sequences. Furthermore, we investigate methods to mitigate this positional
hallucination, aiming to improve faithfulness specifically in the concluding
segments of long outputs.

Abstract: Detoxifying offensive language while preserving the speaker's original intent
is a challenging yet critical goal for improving the quality of online
interactions. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in rewriting
toxic content, they often default to overly polite rewrites, distorting the
emotional tone and communicative intent. This problem is especially acute in
Chinese, where toxicity often arises implicitly through emojis, homophones, or
discourse context. We present ToxiRewriteCN, the first Chinese detoxification
dataset explicitly designed to preserve sentiment polarity. The dataset
comprises 1,556 carefully annotated triplets, each containing a toxic sentence,
a sentiment-aligned non-toxic rewrite, and labeled toxic spans. It covers five
real-world scenarios: standard expressions, emoji-induced and homophonic
toxicity, as well as single-turn and multi-turn dialogues. We evaluate 17 LLMs,
including commercial and open-source models with variant architectures, across
four dimensions: detoxification accuracy, fluency, content preservation, and
sentiment polarity. Results show that while commercial and MoE models perform
best overall, all models struggle to balance safety with emotional fidelity in
more subtle or context-heavy settings such as emoji, homophone, and
dialogue-based inputs. We release ToxiRewriteCN to support future research on
controllable, sentiment-aware detoxification for Chinese.

Conclusion: *prefilling attack*是一种简单、鲁棒且低成本的方法，可增强FTP在多选题评估中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on multiple-choice
question answering (MCQA) tasks using *first-token probability* (FTP), which
selects the answer option whose initial token has the highest likelihood. While
efficient, FTP can be fragile: models may assign high probability to unrelated
tokens (*misalignment*) or use a valid token merely as part of a generic
preamble rather than as a clear answer choice (*misinterpretation*),
undermining the reliability of symbolic evaluation. We propose a simple
solution: the *prefilling attack*, a structured natural-language prefix (e.g.,
"*The correct option is:*") prepended to the model output. Originally explored
in AI safety, we repurpose prefilling to steer the model to respond with a
clean, valid option, without modifying its parameters. Empirically, the FTP
with prefilling strategy substantially improves accuracy, calibration, and
output consistency across a broad set of LLMs and MCQA benchmarks. It

generation approaches that require full decoding and external classifiers,
while being significantly more efficient. Our findings suggest that prefilling
is a simple, robust, and low-cost method to enhance the reliability of
FTP-based evaluation in multiple-choice settings.

TL;DR: FlowKV提出了一种多轮隔离机制，用于管理KV Cache，避免重复压缩早期对话内容，显著提升了多轮对话中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮对话应用中，KV Cache的线性增长带来高计算成本，现有策略因重复压缩早期内容导致性能下降和信息丢失。

Method: FlowKV采用多轮隔离机制，保留历史压缩KV Cache，仅对新生成的KV对进行压缩，避免重复压缩旧内容。

Result: FlowKV在指令跟随准确性和用户偏好保留上显著优于基线策略，提升幅度从10.90%到75.40%。

Conclusion: FlowKV通过多轮隔离机制有效解决了KV Cache管理中的信息丢失问题，提升了多轮对话性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn
conversational applications, where the management of the Key-Value (KV) Cache
presents a significant bottleneck. The linear growth of the KV Cache with
dialogue history imposes substantial computational costs, and existing eviction
strategies often degrade performance by repeatedly compressing early
conversational context, leading to information loss and context forgetting.
This paper introduces FlowKV, a novel \textbf{multi-turn isolation mechanism}
for KV Cache management, which can be applied to any KV Cache compression
method without training. FlowKV's core innovation is a multi-turn isolation
mechanism that preserves the accumulated compressed KV cache from past turns.
Compression is then strategically applied only to the newly generated KV pairs
of the latest completed turn, effectively preventing the re-compression of
older context and thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our results
demonstrate that FlowKV consistently and significantly outperforms baseline
strategies in maintaining instruction-following accuracy and user preference
retention from 10.90\% to 75.40\%, particularly in later conversational turns.

Abstract: A recently proposed method enables efficient estimation of the KL divergence
between language models, including models with different architectures, by
assigning coordinates based on log-likelihood vectors. To better understand the
behavior of this metric, we systematically evaluate KL divergence across a wide
range of conditions using publicly available language models. Our analysis
covers comparisons between pretraining checkpoints, fine-tuned and base models,
and layers via the logit lens. We find that trajectories of language models, as
measured by KL divergence, exhibit a spiral structure during pretraining and
thread-like progressions across layers. Furthermore, we show that, in terms of
diffusion exponents, model trajectories in the log-likelihood space are more
constrained than those in weight space.

Abstract: Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have achieved significant
success in interactive environments, attracting significant academic and
industrial attention. Despite these advancements, current research
predominantly focuses on English scenarios. In reality, there are over 7,000
languages worldwide, all of which demand access to comparable agentic services.
Nevertheless, the development of language agents remains inadequate for meeting
the diverse requirements of multilingual agentic applications. To fill this
gap, we introduce X-WebAgentBench, a novel multilingual agent benchmark in an
interactive web environment, which evaluates the planning and interaction
performance of language agents across multiple languages, thereby contributing
to the advancement of global agent intelligence. Additionally, we assess the
performance of various LLMs and cross-lingual alignment methods, examining
their effectiveness in enhancing agents. Our findings reveal that even advanced
models like GPT-4o, when combined with cross-lingual techniques, fail to
achieve satisfactory results. We hope that X-WebAgentBench can serve as a
valuable benchmark for multilingual agent scenario in real-world applications.

Conclusion: RePPL不仅能检测幻觉，还能解释其来源，初步揭示了幻觉的混沌模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful, but hallucinations remain
a vital obstacle to their trustworthy use. While previous works improved the
capability of hallucination detection by measuring uncertainty, they all lack
the ability to explain the provenance behind why hallucinations occur, i.e.,
which part of the inputs tends to trigger hallucinations. Recent works on the
prompt attack indicate that uncertainty exists in semantic propagation, where
attention mechanisms gradually fuse local token information into high-level
semantics across layers. Meanwhile, uncertainty also emerges in language
generation, due to its probability-based selection of high-level semantics for
sampled generations. Based on that, we propose RePPL to recalibrate uncertainty
measurement by these two aspects, which dispatches explainable uncertainty
scores to each token and aggregates in Perplexity-style Log-Average form as
total score. Experiments show that our method achieves the best comprehensive
detection performance across various QA datasets on advanced models (average
AUC of 0.833), and our method is capable of producing token-level uncertainty
scores as explanations for the hallucination. Leveraging these scores, we
preliminarily find the chaotic pattern of hallucination and showcase its
promising usage.

paper, we investigate the anchoring effect, a cognitive bias where the mind
relies heavily on the first information as anchors to make affected judgments.
We explore whether LLMs are affected by anchoring, the underlying mechanisms,
and potential mitigation strategies. To facilitate studies at scale on the
anchoring effect, we introduce a new dataset, SynAnchors. Combining refined
evaluation metrics, we benchmark current widely used LLMs. Our findings show
that LLMs' anchoring bias exists commonly with shallow-layer acting and is not
eliminated by conventional strategies, while reasoning can offer some
mitigation. This recontextualization via cognitive psychology urges that LLM
evaluations focus not on standard benchmarks or over-optimized robustness
tests, but on cognitive-bias-aware trustworthy evaluation.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success on
reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, their
enhanced reasoning capabilities do not necessarily translate to improved safety
performance-and in some cases, may even degrade it. This raises an important
research question: how can we enhance the safety of LRMs? In this paper, we
present a comprehensive empirical study on how to enhance the safety of LRMs
through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our investigation begins with an
unexpected observation: directly distilling safe responses from DeepSeek-R1
fails to significantly enhance safety. We analyze this phenomenon and identify
three key failure patterns that contribute to it. We then demonstrate that
explicitly addressing these issues during the data distillation process can
lead to substantial safety improvements. Next, we explore whether a long and
complex reasoning process is necessary for achieving safety. Interestingly, we
find that simply using short or template-based reasoning process can attain
comparable safety performance-and are significantly easier for models to learn
than more intricate reasoning chains. These findings prompt a deeper reflection
on the role of reasoning in ensuring safety. Finally, we find that mixing math
reasoning data during safety fine-tuning is helpful to balance safety and
over-refusal. Overall, we hope our empirical study could provide a more
holistic picture on enhancing the safety of LRMs. The code and data used in our
experiments are released in https://github.com/thu-coai/LRM-Safety-Study.

Result: 实验表明GainLoRA优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GainLoRA通过门控设计有效提升持续学习性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL), which requires the model to learn multiple tasks
sequentially, is crucial for language models (LMs). Recently, low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), one of the most representative parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, has gained increasing attention in CL of LMs.
However, most existing CL methods based on LoRA typically expand a new LoRA
branch to learn each new task and force the new and old LoRA branches to
contribute equally to old tasks, potentially leading to forgetting. In this
work, we propose a new method, called gated integration of low-rank adaptation
(GainLoRA), for CL of LMs. GainLoRA expands a new LoRA branch for each new task
and introduces gating modules to integrate the new and old LoRA branches.
Furthermore, GainLoRA leverages the new gating module to minimize the
contribution from the new LoRA branch to old tasks, effectively mitigating
forgetting and improving the model's overall performance. Experimental results
on CL benchmarks demonstrate that GainLoRA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: KD对小模型平均提升10%（最高22%），但对大模型仅提升1.3%。教师任务专长比性能更关键，且KD可能降低推理保真度。

Conclusion: KD对小模型效果显著，但需权衡推理保真度；教师任务专长和信号设计对KD效果至关重要。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large language
models into smaller ones while preserving performance. Despite the recent
traction of KD research, its effectiveness for smaller language models (LMs)
and the mechanisms driving knowledge transfer remain underexplored. In this
work, we present the first large-scale empirical and statistical analysis of KD
across models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters on 14 complex reasoning tasks
in a zero-shot setting. Our findings reveal that KD can improve the average
performance of smaller models by up to $10\%$, with a peak task specific gain
of $22\%$, while providing only marginal benefits ($\sim 1.3\%$) for larger
models. Surprisingly, teacher performance has a minimal impact on student
outcomes, while teacher task expertise impacts KD effectiveness. A correlation
study indicates that smaller LMs benefit more from KD, whereas larger LMs show
diminished gains. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between improvements
in student performance and reasoning fidelity, suggesting that while KD
enhances accuracy, it does not always maintain the structured decision-making
processes of the teacher. Our ablation study further highlights the importance
of teacher signals and logit smoothing in influencing students' performance
after distillation. Overall, our study offers a comprehensive empirical and
statistical assessment of KD, highlighting both its benefits and trade-offs
when distilling knowledge from larger to smaller LMs.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks.
However, it is challenging for them to learn new tasks incrementally due to
catastrophic forgetting. Existing approaches rely on experience replay,
optimization constraints, or task differentiation, which encounter strict
limitations in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose Joint
Flashback Adaptation. We first introduce flashbacks -- a limited number of
prompts from old tasks -- when adapting to new tasks and constrain the
deviations of the model outputs compared to the original one. We then
interpolate latent tasks between flashbacks and new tasks to enable jointly
learning relevant latent tasks, new tasks, and flashbacks, alleviating data
sparsity in flashbacks and facilitating knowledge sharing for smooth
adaptation. Our method requires only a limited number of flashbacks without
access to the replay data and is task-agnostic. We conduct extensive
experiments on state-of-the-art large language models across 1000+
instruction-following tasks, arithmetic reasoning tasks, and general reasoning
tasks. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our method in
improving generalization on new tasks and reducing forgetting in old tasks.

Abstract: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted widespread attention
due to their powerful performance. However, due to the unavoidable exposure to
socially biased data during training, LLMs tend to exhibit social biases,
particularly gender bias. To better explore and quantifying the degree of
gender bias in LLMs, we propose a pair of datasets named GenBiasEval and
GenHintEval, respectively. The GenBiasEval is responsible for evaluating the
degree of gender bias in LLMs, accompanied by an evaluation metric named
AFGB-Score (Absolutely Fair Gender Bias Score). Meanwhile, the GenHintEval is
used to assess whether LLMs can provide responses consistent with prompts that
contain gender hints, along with the accompanying evaluation metric UB-Score
(UnBias Score). Besides, in order to mitigate gender bias in LLMs more
effectively, we present the LFTF (Locating First and Then Fine-Tuning)
algorithm.The algorithm first ranks specific LLM blocks by their relevance to
gender bias in descending order using a metric called BMI (Block Mitigating
Importance Score). Based on this ranking, the block most strongly associated
with gender bias is then fine-tuned using a carefully designed loss function.
Numerous experiments have shown that our proposed LFTF algorithm can
significantly mitigate gender bias in LLMs while maintaining their general
capabilities.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a common approach to improve the
domain-specific question-answering (QA) performance of large language models
(LLMs). However, recent literature reveals that due to the conflicts between
LLMs' internal knowledge and the context knowledge of training data, vanilla
SFT using the full QA training set is usually suboptimal. In this paper, we
first design a query diversification strategy for robust conflict detection and
then conduct a series of experiments to analyze the impact of knowledge
conflict. We find that 1) training samples with varied conflicts contribute
differently, where SFT on the data with large conflicts leads to catastrophic
performance drops; 2) compared to directly filtering out the conflict data,
appropriately applying the conflict data would be more beneficial. Motivated by
this, we propose a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Fine-tuning (namely
KaFT) approach to effectively boost LLMs' performance. The core of KaFT is to
adapt the training weight by assigning different rewards for different training
samples according to conflict level. Extensive experiments show that KaFT
brings consistent and significant improvements across four LLMs. More analyses
prove that KaFT effectively improves the model generalization and alleviates
the hallucination.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of protoknowledge to formalize and measure how
sequences of tokens encoding Knowledge Graphs are internalized during
pretraining and utilized at inference time by Large Language Models (LLMs).
Indeed, LLMs have demonstrated the ability to memorize vast amounts of token
sequences during pretraining, and a central open question is how they leverage
this memorization as reusable knowledge through generalization. We then
categorize protoknowledge into lexical, hierarchical, and topological forms,
varying on the type of knowledge that needs to be activated. We measure
protoknowledge through Knowledge Activation Tasks (KATs), analyzing its general
properties such as semantic bias. We then investigate the impact of
protoknowledge on Text-to-SPARQL performance by varying prompting strategies
depending on input conditions. To this end, we adopt a novel analysis framework
that assesses whether model predictions align with the successful activation of
the relevant protoknowledge for each query. This methodology provides a
practical tool to explore Semantic-Level Data Contamination and serves as an

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) and reading comprehension (RC) benchmarks are
essential for assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
retrieving and reproducing knowledge. However, we demonstrate that popular QA
and RC benchmarks are biased and do not cover questions about different
demographics or regions in a representative way, potentially due to a lack of
diversity of those involved in their creation. We perform a qualitative content
analysis of 30 benchmark papers and a quantitative analysis of 20 respective
benchmark datasets to learn (1) who is involved in the benchmark creation, (2)
how social bias is addressed or prevented, and (3) whether the demographics of
the creators and annotators correspond to particular biases in the content.
Most analyzed benchmark papers provided insufficient information regarding the
stakeholders involved in benchmark creation, particularly the annotators.
Notably, just one of the benchmark papers explicitly reported measures taken to
address social representation issues. Moreover, the data analysis revealed
gender, religion, and geographic biases across a wide range of encyclopedic,
commonsense, and scholarly benchmarks. More transparent and bias-aware QA and
RC benchmark creation practices are needed to facilitate better scrutiny and

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM accuracy by adding passages
retrieved from an external corpus to the LLM prompt. This paper investigates
how positional bias - the tendency of LLMs to weight information differently
based on its position in the prompt - affects not only the LLM's capability to
capitalize on relevant passages, but also its susceptibility to distracting
passages. Through extensive experiments on three benchmarks, we show how
state-of-the-art retrieval pipelines, while attempting to retrieve relevant
passages, systematically bring highly distracting ones to the top ranks, with
over 60% of queries containing at least one highly distracting passage among
the top-10 retrieved passages. As a result, the impact of the LLM positional
bias, which in controlled settings is often reported as very prominent by
related works, is actually marginal in real scenarios since both relevant and
distracting passages are, in turn, penalized. Indeed, our findings reveal that
sophisticated strategies that attempt to rearrange the passages based on LLM
positional preferences do not perform better than random shuffling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can transform education, but their optimization

requires strategically withholding answers. To mitigate this, we propose an
online reinforcement learning (RL)-based alignment framework that can quickly
adapt LLMs into effective tutors using simulated student-tutor interactions by
emphasizing pedagogical quality and guided problem-solving over simply giving
away answers. We use our method to train a 7B parameter tutor model without
human annotations which reaches similar performance to larger proprietary
models like LearnLM. We introduce a controllable reward weighting to balance
pedagogical support and student solving accuracy, allowing us to trace the
Pareto frontier between these two objectives. Our models better preserve
reasoning capabilities than single-turn SFT baselines and can optionally
enhance interpretability through thinking tags that expose the model's

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在生成长推理链时存在冗余问题，限制了效率。本研究旨在通过强化学习方法提升推理效率。

Method: 提出统一的长度奖励塑造框架，并设计LASER方法（基于步函数的奖励）及其动态难度感知变体LASER-D。

Result: 实验表明，LASER-D在多个模型上显著提升性能（如AIME2024 +6.1）并减少63%的token使用。

Conclusion: 动态难度感知的奖励塑造能有效平衡推理性能和效率，减少冗余。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
complex problems through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly by
generating long reasoning traces. However, these extended outputs often exhibit
substantial redundancy, which limits the efficiency of LRMs. In this paper, we
investigate RL-based approaches to promote reasoning efficiency. Specifically,
we first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient
reasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on
this perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method
(LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target
length. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal
balance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based
on two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during
training, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and
dynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of
thought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be
difficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries.
This approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow
thinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff. The resulting method is termed
LASER-D (Dynamic and Difficulty-aware). Experiments on
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B show that our approach significantly enhances both
reasoning performance and response length efficiency. For instance, LASER-D and
its variant achieve a +6.1 improvement on AIME2024 while reducing token usage
by 63%. Further analysis reveals our RL-based compression produces more concise
reasoning patterns with less redundant "self-reflections". Resources are at

the MAPLE score, which holistically quantifies reasoning misalignment by
integrating error rates, redundancy, and validity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to solve reasoning and
mathematical problems using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. Expanding CoT
length, as seen in models such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly enhances this
reasoning for complex problems, but requires costly and high-quality long CoT
data and fine-tuning. This work, inspired by the deep thinking paradigm of
DeepSeek-R1, utilizes a steering technique to enhance the reasoning ability of
an LLM without external datasets. Our method first employs Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to extract interpretable features from vanilla CoT. These features are
then used to steer the LLM's internal states during generation. Recognizing
that many LLMs do not have corresponding pre-trained SAEs, we further introduce
a novel SAE-free steering algorithm, which directly computes steering
directions from the residual activations of an LLM, obviating the need for an
explicit SAE. Experimental results demonstrate that both our SAE-based and
subsequent SAE-free steering algorithms significantly enhance the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning on open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with proprietary data
is now a standard practice for downstream developers to obtain task-specific
LLMs. Surprisingly, we reveal a new and concerning risk along with the
practice: the creator of the open-source LLMs can later extract the private
downstream fine-tuning data through simple backdoor training, only requiring
black-box access to the fine-tuned downstream model. Our comprehensive
experiments, across 4 popularly used open-source models with 3B to 32B

can be strikingly high: in practical settings, as much as 76.3% downstream
fine-tuning data (queries) out of a total 5,000 samples can be perfectly
extracted, and the success rate can increase to 94.9% in more ideal settings.
We also explore a detection-based defense strategy but find it can be bypassed

Method: UniErase通过两个阶段实现遗忘：(I) 优化阶段将目标遗忘输出绑定到模型的概率分布；(II) 轻量级模型编辑阶段激活学习到的标记以诱导遗忘目标。

Result: 在TOFU基准测试中，UniErase仅修改约3.66%的模型参数，遗忘效果优于之前的最佳基线4.01倍，同时模型能力保持更好。

Conclusion: UniErase在遗忘领域实现了双重顶级性能，为标记学习诱导遗忘目标提供了新研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models require iterative updates to address challenges such as
knowledge conflicts and outdated information (e.g., incorrect, private, or
illegal contents). Machine unlearning provides a systematic methodology for
targeted knowledge removal from trained models, enabling elimination of
sensitive information influences. However, mainstream fine-tuning-based
unlearning methods often fail to balance unlearning efficacy and model ability,
frequently resulting in catastrophic model collapse under extensive knowledge
removal. Meanwhile, in-context unlearning, which relies solely on contextual
prompting without modifying the model's intrinsic mechanisms, suffers from
limited generalizability and struggles to achieve true unlearning. In this
work, we introduce UniErase, a novel unlearning paradigm that employs learnable
parametric suffix (unlearning token) to steer language models toward targeted
forgetting behaviors. UniErase operates through two key phases: (I) an
optimization stage that binds desired unlearning outputs to the model's
autoregressive probability distribution via token optimization, followed by
(II) a lightweight model editing phase that activates the learned token to
probabilistically induce specified forgetting objective. Serving as a new
research direction for token learning to induce unlearning target, UniErase
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across batch, sequential, and
precise unlearning under fictitious and real-world knowledge settings.
Remarkably, in terms of TOFU benchmark, UniErase, modifying only around 3.66%
of the LLM parameters, outperforms previous forgetting SOTA baseline by around
4.01 times for model ability with even better unlearning efficacy. Similarly,
UniErase, maintaining more ability, also surpasses previous retaining SOTA by
35.96% for unlearning efficacy, showing dual top-tier performances in current
unlearing domain.

Result: 在不微调或额外数据的情况下，ThinkLess与完整CoT解码的准确性相当，同时显著减少解码时间和内存消耗。

Conclusion: ThinkLess是一种高效的推理框架，适用于需要快速且低资源消耗的LLM推理场景。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), the excessive length of reasoning tokens increases latency and
KV cache memory usage, and may even truncate final answers under context
limits. We propose ThinkLess, an inference-efficient framework that terminates
reasoning generation early and maintains output quality without modifying the
model. Atttention analysis reveals that answer tokens focus minimally on
earlier reasoning steps and primarily attend to the reasoning terminator token,
due to information migration under causal masking. Building on this insight,
ThinkLess inserts the terminator token at earlier positions to skip redundant
reasoning while preserving the underlying knowledge transfer. To prevent format
discruption casued by early termination, ThinkLess employs a lightweight
post-regulation mechanism, relying on the model's natural instruction-following
ability to produce well-structured answers. Without fine-tuning or auxiliary
data, ThinkLess achieves comparable accuracy to full-length CoT decoding while
greatly reducing decoding time and memory consumption.

Conclusion: TAPO通过外部指导生成可解释性强、可读性高的推理模型，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective method for training
reasoning models. However, existing RL approaches typically bias the model's
output distribution toward reward-maximizing paths without introducing external
knowledge. This limits their exploration capacity and results in a narrower
reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. To address this
limitation, we propose TAPO (Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization), a novel
framework that augments RL by incorporating external high-level guidance
("thought patterns"). By adaptively integrating structured thoughts during
training, TAPO effectively balances model-internal exploration and external
guidance exploitation. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly outperforms GRPO by 99% on AIME, 41% on AMC, and 17% on Minerva
Math. Notably, these high-level thought patterns, abstracted from only 500
prior samples, generalize effectively across various tasks and models. This
highlights TAPO's potential for broader applications across multiple tasks and
domains. Our further analysis reveals that introducing external guidance
produces powerful reasoning models with superior explainability of inference
behavior and enhanced output readability.

Conclusion: LyapLock是首个具有理论保证的模型编辑框架，实现了渐进最优编辑性能，同时满足长期知识保留约束。

Abstract: Large Language Models often contain factually incorrect or outdated
knowledge, giving rise to model editing methods for precise knowledge updates.
However, current mainstream locate-then-edit approaches exhibit a progressive
performance decline during sequential editing, due to inadequate mechanisms for
long-term knowledge preservation. To tackle this, we model the sequential
editing as a constrained stochastic programming. Given the challenges posed by
the cumulative preservation error constraint and the gradually revealed editing
tasks, \textbf{LyapLock} is proposed. It integrates queuing theory and Lyapunov
optimization to decompose the long-term constrained programming into tractable
stepwise subproblems for efficient solving. This is the first model editing
framework with rigorous theoretical guarantees, achieving asymptotic optimal
editing performance while meeting the constraints of long-term knowledge
preservation. Experimental results show that our framework scales sequential
editing capacity to over 10,000 edits while stabilizing general capabilities
and boosting average editing efficacy by 11.89\% over SOTA baselines.
Furthermore, it can be leveraged to enhance the performance of baseline
methods. Our code is released on https://github.com/caskcsg/LyapLock.

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of Memorization in Multilingual
Large Language Models (MLLMs), analyzing 95 languages using models across
diverse model scales, architectures, and memorization definitions. As MLLMs are
increasingly deployed, understanding their memorization behavior has become
critical. Yet prior work has focused primarily on monolingual models, leaving
multilingual memorization underexplored, despite the inherently long-tailed
nature of training corpora. We find that the prevailing assumption, that
memorization is highly correlated with training data availability, fails to
fully explain memorization patterns in MLLMs. We hypothesize that treating
languages in isolation - ignoring their similarities - obscures the true
patterns of memorization. To address this, we propose a novel graph-based
correlation metric that incorporates language similarity to analyze
cross-lingual memorization. Our analysis reveals that among similar languages,
those with fewer training tokens tend to exhibit higher memorization, a trend
that only emerges when cross-lingual relationships are explicitly modeled.
These findings underscore the importance of a language-aware perspective in
evaluating and mitigating memorization vulnerabilities in MLLMs. This also
constitutes empirical evidence that language similarity both explains
Memorization in MLLMs and underpins Cross-lingual Transferability, with broad
implications for multilingual NLP.

Conclusion: HyCo$_2$有效平衡了信息保留与计算效率，显著提升LLM的长文本推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges in
long-sequence inference due to computational inefficiency and redundant
processing, driving interest in context compression techniques. Existing
methods often rely on token importance to perform hard local compression or
encode context into latent representations for soft global compression.
However, the uneven distribution of textual content relevance and the diversity
of demands for user instructions mean these approaches frequently lead to the
loss of potentially valuable information. To address this, we propose
$\textbf{Hy}$brid $\textbf{Co}$ntext $\textbf{Co}$mpression (HyCo$_2$) for
LLMs, which integrates both global and local perspectives to guide context
compression while retaining both the essential semantics and critical details
for task completion. Specifically, we employ a hybrid adapter to refine global
semantics with the global view, based on the observation that different
adapters excel at different tasks. Then we incorporate a classification layer
that assigns a retention probability to each context token based on the local
view, determining whether it should be retained or discarded. To foster a
balanced integration of global and local compression, we introduce auxiliary
paraphrasing and completion pretraining before instruction tuning. This
promotes a synergistic integration that emphasizes instruction-relevant
information while preserving essential local details, ultimately balancing
local and global information retention in context compression. Experiments show
that our HyCo$_2$ method significantly enhances long-text reasoning while
reducing token usage. It improves the performance of various LLM series by an
average of 13.1\% across seven knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks. Moreover,
HyCo$_2$ matches the performance of uncompressed methods while reducing token
consumption by 88.8\%.

Conclusion: Soft Thinking突破了离散语言推理的瓶颈，同时保持了输出的可解释性和可读性。

Abstract: Human cognition typically involves thinking through abstract, fluid concepts
rather than strictly using discrete linguistic tokens. Current reasoning
models, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human
language, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in
the semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and
upper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration
of reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling
one token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free
method that emulates human-like "soft" reasoning by generating soft, abstract
concept tokens in a continuous concept space. These concept tokens are created
by the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the
continuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer
representations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence,
each generated concept token encapsulates multiple meanings from related
discrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge
effectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse
mathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness
and efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points
while simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard
CoT. Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain
highly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking
to break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning. Code is

but neglect inter-fact dependencies, enabling subtle vulnerabilities. In this
work, we introduce MontageLie, a challenging benchmark that constructs
deceptive narratives by "montaging" truthful statements without introducing
explicit hallucinations. We demonstrate that both coarse-grained LLM-based
evaluators and current fine-grained frameworks are susceptible to this attack,
with AUC-ROC scores falling below 65%. To enable more robust fine-grained
evaluation, we propose DoveScore, a novel framework that jointly verifies
factual accuracy and event-order consistency. By modeling inter-fact
relationships, DoveScore outperforms existing fine-grained methods by over 8%,
providing a more robust solution for long-form text alignment evaluation. Our
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/dannalily/DoveScore.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM-as-a-judge框架的潜在漏洞，并展示了通过强化学习逆向工程人类偏好的可能性。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely evaluated by
other LLMs trained to predict human preferences. This framework--known as
LLM-as-a-judge--is highly scalable and relatively low cost. However, it is also
vulnerable to malicious exploitation, as LLM responses can be tuned to overfit
the preferences of the judge. Previous work shows that the answers generated by
a candidate-LLM can be edited post hoc to maximise the score assigned to them
by a judge-LLM. In this study, we adopt a different approach and use the signal
provided by judge-LLMs as a reward to adversarially tune models that generate
text preambles designed to boost downstream performance. We find that frozen
LLMs pipelined with these models attain higher LLM-evaluation scores than
existing frameworks. Crucially, unlike other frameworks which intervene
directly on the model's response, our method is virtually undetectable. We also
demonstrate that the effectiveness of the tuned preamble generator transfers
when the candidate-LLM and the judge-LLM are replaced with models that are not
used during training. These findings raise important questions about the design
of more reliable LLM-as-a-judge evaluation settings. They also demonstrate that
human preferences can be reverse engineered effectively, by pipelining LLMs to
optimise upstream preambles via reinforcement learning--an approach that could
find future applications in diverse tasks and domains beyond adversarial
attacks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved
remarkable performance in the domain of reasoning. A key component of their
training is the incorporation of verifiable rewards within reinforcement
learning (RL). However, existing reward benchmarks do not evaluate
reference-based reward systems, leaving researchers with limited understanding
of the accuracy of verifiers used in RL. In this paper, we introduce two
benchmarks, VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, designed to assess the
performance of reference-based reward systems. These benchmarks are constructed
through meticulous data collection and curation, followed by careful human
annotation to ensure high quality. Current models still show considerable room
for improvement on both VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, especially
smaller-scale models. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough and comprehensive
analysis of evaluation results, offering insights for understanding and
developing reference-based reward systems. Our proposed benchmarks serve as
effective tools for guiding the development of verifier accuracy and the
reasoning capabilities of models trained via RL in reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 随着LLM在敏感领域的部署增加，确保其在上下文中遵守用户定义的安全政策（尤其是信息非披露）变得至关重要。现有研究缺乏针对上下文安全保护的大规模基准。

Method: 作者构建了CoPriva数据集，包含现实场景中的明确政策和查询（包括直接和间接攻击），并评估了10个LLM的合规性。

Result: 许多LLM会违反政策并泄露敏感信息，尤其是在间接攻击下表现更差。模型在生成时难以整合政策约束，但通过明确提示可以部分修正输出。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在敏感应用中的安全对齐存在重大缺陷，亟需更鲁棒的方法确保上下文安全。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
domains such as enterprise and government, ensuring that they adhere to
user-defined security policies within context is critical-especially with
respect to information non-disclosure. While prior LLM studies have focused on
general safety and socially sensitive data, large-scale benchmarks for
contextual security preservation against attacks remain lacking. To address
this, we introduce a novel large-scale benchmark dataset, CoPriva, evaluating
LLM adherence to contextual non-disclosure policies in question answering.
Derived from realistic contexts, our dataset includes explicit policies and
queries designed as direct and challenging indirect attacks seeking prohibited
information. We evaluate 10 LLMs on our benchmark and reveal a significant
vulnerability: many models violate user-defined policies and leak sensitive
information. This failure is particularly severe against indirect attacks,
highlighting a critical gap in current LLM safety alignment for sensitive
applications. Our analysis reveals that while models can often identify the
correct answer to a query, they struggle to incorporate policy constraints
during generation. In contrast, they exhibit a partial ability to revise
outputs when explicitly prompted. Our findings underscore the urgent need for
more robust methods to guarantee contextual security.

Abstract: Large language models are able to exploit in-context learning to access

While promising, its inner workings remain unclear. In this work, we shed light

attribution-based method to identify specialized attention heads, revealing
in-context heads that comprehend instructions and retrieve relevant contextual
information, and parametric heads that store entities' relational knowledge. To
better understand their roles, we extract function vectors and modify their
attention weights to show how they can influence the answer generation process.
Finally, we leverage the gained insights to trace the sources of knowledge used

Motivation: 现有LLM通常仅使用单一推理模态（如自然语言），限制了模态间的协同效应。MoT旨在通过多模态训练和推理填补这一空白。

Method: MoT采用两阶段设计：1) 自演化的多模态训练，联合学习过滤后的自生成推理；2) 多模态推理，充分利用三种模态的协同效应。

Result: 在FOLIO和ProofWriter等逻辑推理基准测试中，MoT比单模态方法平均提升11.7个百分点。

Conclusion: MoT框架在训练和推理阶段均有效，尤其在复杂逻辑问题上表现突出，且不同模态贡献互补优势。

Abstract: Human beings naturally utilize multiple reasoning modalities to learn and
solve logical problems, i.e., different representational formats such as
natural language, code, and symbolic logic. In contrast, most existing
LLM-based approaches operate with a single reasoning modality during training,
typically natural language. Although some methods explored modality selection
or augmentation at inference time, the training process remains modality-blind,
limiting synergy among modalities. To fill in this gap, we propose
Mixture-of-Thought (MoT), a framework that enables LLMs to reason across three
complementary modalities: natural language, code, and a newly introduced
symbolic modality, truth-table, which systematically enumerates logical cases
and partially mitigates key failure modes in natural language reasoning. MoT
adopts a two-phase design: (1) self-evolving MoT training, which jointly learns
from filtered, self-generated rationales across modalities; and (2) MoT
inference, which fully leverages the synergy of three modalities to produce
better predictions. Experiments on logical reasoning benchmarks including FOLIO
and ProofWriter demonstrate that our MoT framework consistently and
significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines with single-modality
chain-of-thought approaches, achieving up to +11.7pp average accuracy gain.
Further analyses show that our MoT framework benefits both training and
inference stages; that it is particularly effective on harder logical reasoning
problems; and that different modalities contribute complementary strengths,
with truth-table reasoning helping to overcome key bottlenecks in natural
language inference.

Result: 发现模型评估者对伦理拒绝的评分显著高于人类用户，而对技术拒绝的评分无显著差异。

Conclusion: 这种差异被称为“审核偏差”，引发了对自动评估系统的透明度、价值对齐和规范性假设的质疑。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
settings, their ability to refuse ethically sensitive prompts-such as those
involving hate speech or illegal activities-has become central to content
moderation and responsible AI practices. While refusal responses can be viewed
as evidence of ethical alignment and safety-conscious behavior, recent research
suggests that users may perceive them negatively. At the same time, automated
assessments of model outputs are playing a growing role in both evaluation and
training. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks-in which one model is used
to evaluate the output of another-are now widely adopted to guide benchmarking
and fine-tuning. This paper examines whether such model-based evaluators assess
refusal responses differently than human users. Drawing on data from Chatbot
Arena and judgments from two AI judges (GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B), we compare how
different types of refusals are rated. We distinguish ethical refusals, which
explicitly cite safety or normative concerns (e.g., "I can't help with that
because it may be harmful"), and technical refusals, which reflect system
limitations (e.g., "I can't answer because I lack real-time data"). We find
that LLM-as-a-Judge systems evaluate ethical refusals significantly more
favorably than human users, a divergence not observed for technical refusals.
We refer to this divergence as a moderation bias-a systematic tendency for
model-based evaluators to reward refusal behaviors more than human users do.
This raises broader questions about transparency, value alignment, and the
normative assumptions embedded in automated evaluation systems.

Conclusion: MedBrowseComp为可靠的医学信息检索提供了测试平台，并为未来模型改进设定了目标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as decision-support
tools in clinical practice, yet safe clinical reasoning demands integrating
heterogeneous knowledge bases -- trials, primary studies, regulatory documents,
and cost data -- under strict accuracy constraints. Existing evaluations often
rely on synthetic prompts, reduce the task to single-hop factoid queries, or
conflate reasoning with open-ended generation, leaving their real-world utility
unclear. To close this gap, we present MedBrowseComp, the first benchmark that
systematically tests an agent's ability to reliably retrieve and synthesize
multi-hop medical facts from live, domain-specific knowledge bases.
MedBrowseComp contains more than 1,000 human-curated questions that mirror
clinical scenarios where practitioners must reconcile fragmented or conflicting
information to reach an up-to-date conclusion. Applying MedBrowseComp to
frontier agentic systems reveals performance shortfalls as low as ten percent,
exposing a critical gap between current LLM capabilities and the rigor demanded
in clinical settings. MedBrowseComp therefore offers a clear testbed for
reliable medical information seeking and sets concrete goals for future model

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have performed well across various clinical
natural language processing tasks, despite not being directly trained on
electronic health record (EHR) data. In this work, we examine how popular
open-source LLMs learn clinical information from large mined corpora through
two crucial but understudied lenses: (1) their interpretation of clinical
jargon, a foundational ability for understanding real-world clinical notes, and
(2) their responses to unsupported medical claims. For both use cases, we
investigate the frequency of relevant clinical information in their
corresponding pretraining corpora, the relationship between pretraining data
composition and model outputs, and the sources underlying this data. To isolate
clinical jargon understanding, we evaluate LLMs on a new dataset MedLingo.
Unsurprisingly, we find that the frequency of clinical jargon mentions across
major pretraining corpora correlates with model performance. However, jargon
frequently appearing in clinical notes often rarely appears in pretraining
corpora, revealing a mismatch between available data and real-world usage.
Similarly, we find that a non-negligible portion of documents support disputed
claims that can then be parroted by models. Finally, we classified and analyzed
the types of online sources in which clinical jargon and unsupported medical
claims appear, with implications for future dataset composition.

focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall
assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark
appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results
reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle
to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust
approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

Conclusion: DeFT-X通过去噪和稀疏微调的结合，显著提升了跨语言迁移的性能。

Abstract: Effective cross-lingual transfer remains a critical challenge in scaling the
benefits of large language models from high-resource to low-resource languages.
Towards this goal, prior studies have explored many approaches to combine task
knowledge from task-specific data in a (high-resource) source language and
language knowledge from unlabeled text in a (low-resource) target language. One
notable approach proposed composable sparse fine-tuning (SFT) for cross-lingual
transfer that learns task-specific and language-specific sparse masks to select
a subset of the pretrained model's parameters that are further fine-tuned.
These sparse fine-tuned vectors (SFTs) are subsequently composed with the
pretrained model to facilitate zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to a task in a
target language, using only task-specific data from a source language. These
sparse masks for SFTs were identified using a simple magnitude-based pruning.
In our work, we introduce DeFT-X, a novel composable SFT approach that denoises
the weight matrices of a pretrained model before magnitude pruning using
singular value decomposition, thus yielding more robust SFTs. We evaluate
DeFT-X on a diverse set of extremely low-resource languages for sentiment
classification (NusaX) and natural language inference (AmericasNLI) and
demonstrate that it performs at par or outperforms SFT and other prominent
cross-lingual transfer baselines.

integrates these assessments through confidence-aware aggregation, enabling
threshold-free, interpretable classification. Additionally, an adaptive
Mixture-of-Agent router dynamically selects guidelines based on inferred
textual characteristics. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that
AGENT-X substantially surpasses state-of-the-art supervised and zero-shot
approaches in accuracy, interpretability, and generalization.

Abstract: The misuse of large language models (LLMs), such as academic plagiarism, has
driven the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. To bypass
these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these
texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require
substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser,
and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection
algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive
\textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that
effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is
to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like
texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can
still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes
that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an
auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like
distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns
from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to
produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical
analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various
scenarios.

Abstract: Debugging is a critical aspect of LLM's coding ability. Early debugging

addressing complex programming errors that require a deeper understanding of

shifted attention toward leveraging natural language reasoning to enhance

specific benefits does natural language reasoning bring to the debugging

employs natural language as an intermediate representation to improve code
debugging. By debugging at a natural language level, we demonstrate that
NL-DEBUGGING outperforms traditional debugging methods and enables a broader

findings highlight the potential of natural language reasoning to advance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决构建语言模型映射时因依赖大量文本对数似然计算而带来的高计算成本问题。

Method: 提出重采样方法，根据每个文本在不同模型下对数似然的方差选择重要性文本，减少所需文本数量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法仅需约一半文本即可达到与均匀采样相当的KL散度估计精度，并支持高效扩展新模型。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了语言模型映射的高效可扩展构建。

Abstract: We address the computational cost of constructing a model map, which embeds
diverse language models into a common space for comparison via KL divergence.
The map relies on log-likelihoods over a large text set, making the cost
proportional to the number of texts. To reduce this cost, we propose a
resampling method that selects important texts with weights proportional to the
variance of log-likelihoods across models for each text. Our method
significantly reduces the number of required texts while preserving the
accuracy of KL divergence estimates. Experiments show that it achieves
comparable performance to uniform sampling with about half as many texts, and
also facilitates efficient incorporation of new models into an existing map.
These results enable scalable and efficient construction of language model
maps.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation remains a critical challenge in adapting pre-trained
language models to classification tasks, particularly under parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approaches such as adapters. We introduce AdUE1, an efficient
post-hoc uncertainty estimation (UE) method, to enhance softmax-based
estimates. Our approach (1) uses a differentiable approximation of the maximum

fine-tuned head weights and regularizing the model. Evaluations on five NLP
classification datasets across four language models (RoBERTa, ELECTRA, LLaMA-2,
Qwen) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms established
baselines such as Mahalanobis distance and softmax response. Our approach is
lightweight (no base-model changes) and produces better-calibrated confidence.

Abstract: Large language models that use retrieval augmented generation have the

While this approach can help alleviate factual hallucinations by relying on

the model's output remains faithful to these passages. To address this, we
explore the automatic assessment of faithfulness of different models in this
setting. We then focus on ClimateGPT, a large language model specialised in
climate science, to examine which factors in its instruction fine-tuning impact
the model's faithfulness. By excluding unfaithful subsets of the model's
training data, we develop ClimateGPT Faithful+, which achieves an improvement
in faithfulness from 30% to 57% in supported atomic claims according to our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型因缺乏键值缓存机制而推理速度较慢，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 设计了两种延迟和条件化的键值缓存策略：dKV-Cache-Decode（几乎无损加速）和dKV-Cache-Greedy（更高加速但性能略有下降）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基准测试中实现了2-10倍的推理加速，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 延迟KV-Cache显著提升了DLMs的推理效率，缩小了与自回归模型的差距。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have been seen as a promising competitor for
autoregressive language models. However, diffusion language models have long
been constrained by slow inference. A core challenge is that their
non-autoregressive architecture and bidirectional attention preclude the
key-value cache that accelerates decoding. We address this bottleneck by
proposing a KV-cache-like mechanism, delayed KV-Cache, for the denoising
process of DLMs. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different
tokens have distinct representation dynamics throughout the diffusion process.
Accordingly, we propose a delayed and conditioned caching strategy for key and
value states. We design two complementary variants to cache key and value
step-by-step: (1) dKV-Cache-Decode, which provides almost lossless
acceleration, and even improves performance on long sequences, suggesting that
existing DLMs may under-utilise contextual information during inference. (2)
dKV-Cache-Greedy, which has aggressive caching with reduced lifespan, achieving
higher speed-ups with quadratic time complexity at the cost of some performance
degradation. dKV-Cache, in final, achieves from 2-10x speedup in inference,
largely narrowing the gap between ARs and DLMs. We evaluate our dKV-Cache on
several benchmarks, delivering acceleration across general language
understanding, mathematical, and code-generation benchmarks. Experiments
demonstrate that cache can also be used in DLMs, even in a training-free manner
from current DLMs.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential across various
domains, their applications in robotics remain largely limited to static,
prompt-based behaviors and still face challenges in handling complex tasks
under zero-shot or few-shot settings. Inspired by human metacognitive learning
and creative problem-solving, we address this limitation by exploring a
fundamental research question: Can LLMs be empowered with metacognitive
capabilities to reason, reflect, and create, thereby enhancing their ability to
perform robotic tasks with minimal demonstrations? In this paper, we present an
early-stage framework that integrates metacognitive learning into LLM-powered
multi-robot collaboration. The proposed framework equips the LLM-powered
robotic agents with a skill decomposition and self-reflection mechanism that
identifies modular skills from prior tasks, reflects on failures in unseen task
scenarios, and synthesizes effective new solutions. Experimental results show
that our metacognitive-learning-empowered LLM framework significantly
outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, we observe that the framework is
capable of generating solutions that differ from the ground truth yet still
successfully complete the tasks. These exciting findings support our hypothesis
that metacognitive learning can foster creativity in robotic planning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like capabilities in
language comprehension and generation, becoming active participants in social
and cognitive domains. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit
personality-like traits and how these traits compare with human personality,
focusing on the applicability of conventional personality assessment tools. A
behavior-based approach was used across three empirical studies. Study 1
examined test-retest stability and found that LLMs show higher variability and
are more input-sensitive than humans, lacking long-term stability. Based on
this, we propose the Distributed Personality Framework, conceptualizing LLM
traits as dynamic and input-driven. Study 2 analyzed cross-variant consistency
in personality measures and found LLMs' responses were highly sensitive to item
wording, showing low internal consistency compared to humans. Study 3 explored
personality retention during role-playing, showing LLM traits are shaped by
prompt and parameter settings. These findings suggest that LLMs express fluid,
externally dependent personality patterns, offering insights for constructing
LLM-specific personality frameworks and advancing human-AI interaction. This
work contributes to responsible AI development and extends the boundaries of
personality psychology in the age of intelligent systems.

Conclusion: ICL适应方案在语音识别任务中表现出与人类听众相似的性能特征，但仍存在对某些语言变体的适应不足。

Abstract: Human listeners readily adjust to unfamiliar speakers and language varieties
through exposure, but do these adaptation benefits extend to state-of-the-art
spoken language models? We introduce a scalable framework that allows for
in-context learning (ICL) in Phi-4 Multimodal using interleaved task prompts
and audio-text pairs, and find that as few as 12 example utterances (~50
seconds) at inference time reduce word error rates by a relative 19.7% (1.2
pp.) on average across diverse English corpora. These improvements are most
pronounced in low-resource varieties, when the context and target speaker
match, and when more examples are provided--though scaling our procedure yields
diminishing marginal returns to context length. Overall, we find that our novel
ICL adaptation scheme (1) reveals a similar performance profile to human
listeners, and (2) demonstrates consistent improvements to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) robustness across diverse speakers and language backgrounds.
While adaptation succeeds broadly, significant gaps remain for certain
varieties, revealing where current models still fall short of human
flexibility. We release our prompts and code on GitHub.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in globally
distributed applications, such as tourism assistants, yet their ability to
produce culturally appropriate responses remains underexplored. Existing
multimodal safety benchmarks primarily focus on physical safety and overlook
violations rooted in cultural norms, which can result in symbolic harm. To
address this gap, we introduce CROSS, a benchmark designed to assess the
cultural safety reasoning capabilities of LVLMs. CROSS includes 1,284
multilingual visually grounded queries from 16 countries, three everyday
domains, and 14 languages, where cultural norm violations emerge only when
images are interpreted in context. We propose CROSS-Eval, an intercultural
theory-based framework that measures four key dimensions: cultural awareness,
norm education, compliance, and helpfulness. Using this framework, we evaluate
21 leading LVLMs, including mixture-of-experts models and reasoning models.
Results reveal significant cultural safety gaps: the best-performing model
achieves only 61.79% in awareness and 37.73% in compliance. While some
open-source models reach GPT-4o-level performance, they still fall notably
short of proprietary models. Our results further show that increasing reasoning
capacity improves cultural alignment but does not fully resolve the issue. To
improve model performance, we develop two enhancement strategies: supervised
fine-tuning with culturally grounded, open-ended data and preference tuning
with contrastive response pairs that highlight safe versus unsafe behaviors.
These methods substantially improve GPT-4o's cultural awareness (+60.14%) and
compliance (+55.2%), while preserving general multimodal capabilities with
minimal performance reduction on general multimodal understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: 研究支持开发更具文化包容性的语言模型，并验证了语言特定知识的存在及其对推理的积极影响。

Abstract: Code-switching is a common phenomenon of alternating between different
languages in the same utterance, thought, or conversation. We posit that humans
code-switch because they feel more comfortable talking about certain topics and
domains in one language than another. With the rise of knowledge-intensive
language models, we ask ourselves the next, natural question: Could models hold
more knowledge on some topics in some language X? More importantly, could we
improve reasoning by changing the language that reasoning is performed in? We
coin the term Language Specific Knowledge (LSK) to represent this phenomenon.
As ethnic cultures tend to develop alongside different languages, we employ
culture-specific datasets (that contain knowledge about cultural and social
behavioral norms). We find that language models can perform better when using
chain-of-thought reasoning in some languages other than English, sometimes even
better in low-resource languages. Paired with previous works showing that
semantic similarity does not equate to representational similarity, we
hypothesize that culturally specific texts occur more abundantly in
corresponding languages, enabling specific knowledge to occur only in specific
"expert" languages. Motivated by our initial results, we design a simple
methodology called LSKExtractor to benchmark the language-specific knowledge
present in a language model and, then, exploit it during inference. We show our
results on various models and datasets, showing an average relative improvement
of 10% in accuracy. Our research contributes to the open-source development of
language models that are inclusive and more aligned with the cultural and
linguistic contexts in which they are deployed.

Abstract: Information extraction (IE) plays a crucial role in natural language
processing (NLP) by converting unstructured text into structured knowledge.
Deploying computationally intensive large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained devices for information extraction is challenging,
particularly due to issues like hallucinations, limited context length, and
high latency-especially when handling diverse extraction schemas. To address
these challenges, we propose a two-stage information extraction approach
adapted for on-device LLMs, called Dual-LoRA with Incremental Schema Caching
(DLISC), which enhances both schema identification and schema-aware extraction
in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, DLISC adopts an
Identification LoRA module for retrieving the most relevant schemas to a given
query, and an Extraction LoRA module for performing information extraction
based on the previously selected schemas. To accelerate extraction inference,
Incremental Schema Caching is incorporated to reduce redundant computation,
substantially improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple
information extraction datasets demonstrate notable improvements in both
effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
have led to strong reasoning ability across a wide range of tasks. However,
their ability to perform mathematical reasoning from spoken input remains
underexplored. Prior studies on speech modality have mostly focused on factual
speech understanding or simple audio reasoning tasks, providing limited insight
into logical step-by-step reasoning, such as that required for mathematical
problem solving. To address this gap, we introduce Spoken Math Question
Answering (Spoken-MQA), a new benchmark designed to evaluate the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of speech-based models, including both cascade models
(ASR + LLMs) and end-to-end speech LLMs. Spoken-MQA covers a diverse set of
math problems, including pure arithmetic, single-step and multi-step contextual
reasoning, and knowledge-oriented reasoning problems, all presented in
unambiguous natural spoken language. Through extensive experiments, we find
that: (1) while some speech LLMs perform competitively on contextual reasoning
tasks involving basic arithmetic, they still struggle with direct arithmetic
problems; (2) current LLMs exhibit a strong bias toward symbolic mathematical
expressions written in LaTex and have difficulty interpreting verbalized
mathematical expressions; and (3) mathematical knowledge reasoning abilities
are significantly degraded in current speech LLMs.

Abstract: The emergence of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents new
opportunities for chart understanding. However, due to the fine-grained nature
of these tasks, applying MLLMs typically requires large, high-quality datasets
for task-specific fine-tuning, leading to high data collection and training
costs. To address this, we propose ChartCards, a unified chart-metadata
generation framework for multi-task chart understanding. ChartCards
systematically synthesizes various chart information, including data tables,
visualization code, visual elements, and multi-dimensional semantic captions.
By structuring this information into organized metadata, ChartCards enables a
single chart to support multiple downstream tasks, such as text-to-chart
retrieval, chart summarization, chart-to-table conversion, chart description,
and chart question answering. Using ChartCards, we further construct MetaChart,
a large-scale high-quality dataset containing 10,862 data tables, 85K charts,
and 170 K high-quality chart captions. We validate the dataset through
qualitative crowdsourcing evaluations and quantitative fine-tuning experiments
across various chart understanding tasks. Fine-tuning six different models on
MetaChart resulted in an average performance improvement of 5% across all
tasks. The most notable improvements are seen in text-to-chart retrieval and
chart-to-table tasks, with Long-CLIP and Llama 3.2-11B achieving improvements

Motivation: 当前的事实核查方法主要依赖语言模型的嵌入知识或微调证据，但前者易产生幻觉，后者效果不佳。为解决这一问题，作者提出了一种结合蕴含和生成能力的新方法。

Method: 利用语言模型的生成能力生成支持或反驳理由，并基于这些理由训练模型。同时系统比较了不同提示和微调策略。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合生成能力和系统微调策略，显著提升了事实核查的准确性。

Abstract: Automated fact-checking is a crucial task in this digital age. To verify a
claim, current approaches majorly follow one of two strategies i.e. (i) relying
on embedded knowledge of language models, and (ii) fine-tuning them with
evidence pieces. While the former can make systems to hallucinate, the later
have not been very successful till date. The primary reason behind this is that
fact verification is a complex process. Language models have to parse through
multiple pieces of evidence before making a prediction. Further, the evidence
pieces often contradict each other. This makes the reasoning process even more
complex. We proposed a simple yet effective approach where we relied on
entailment and the generative ability of language models to produce
''supporting'' and ''refuting'' justifications (for the truthfulness of a
claim). We trained language models based on these justifications and achieved
superior results. Apart from that, we did a systematic comparison of different
prompting and fine-tuning strategies, as it is currently lacking in the
literature. Some of our observations are: (i) training language models with raw
evidence sentences registered an improvement up to 8.20% in macro-F1, over the
best performing baseline for the RAW-FC dataset, (ii) similarly, training
language models with prompted claim-evidence understanding (TBE-2) registered
an improvement (with a margin up to 16.39%) over the baselines for the same
dataset, (iii) training language models with entailed justifications (TBE-3)
outperformed the baselines by a huge margin (up to 28.57% and 44.26% for
LIAR-RAW and RAW-FC, respectively). We have shared our code repository to
reproduce the results.

Motivation: 解决乌尔都语等低资源语言中大型语言模型（LLMs）输出的事实可靠性问题，现有解决方案主要针对英语。

Method: 开发了动态多策略证据检索管道，结合单语和翻译方法，并创建了两个手注基准数据集。

Result: UrduFactCheck在多个指标上优于基线方法，并评估了12个SOTA LLMs在乌尔都语事实问答中的表现。

Conclusion: UrduFactCheck填补了乌尔都语事实核查的空白，开源代码和数据集促进了进一步研究。

Abstract: The rapid use of large language models (LLMs) has raised critical concerns
regarding the factual reliability of their outputs, especially in low-resource
languages such as Urdu. Existing automated fact-checking solutions
overwhelmingly focus on English, leaving a significant gap for the 200+ million
Urdu speakers worldwide. In this work, we introduce UrduFactCheck, the first
comprehensive, modular fact-checking framework specifically tailored for Urdu.
Our system features a dynamic, multi-strategy evidence retrieval pipeline that
combines monolingual and translation-based approaches to address the scarcity
of high-quality Urdu evidence. We curate and release two new hand-annotated
benchmarks: UrduFactBench for claim verification and UrduFactQA for evaluating
LLM factuality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UrduFactCheck,
particularly its translation-augmented variants, consistently outperforms
baselines and open-source alternatives on multiple metrics. We further
benchmark twelve state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on factual question answering in
Urdu, highlighting persistent gaps between proprietary and open-source models.

Motivation: 网页导航需要长时程序列决策，但现有MLLM奖励模型存在速度和成本问题，限制了实际部署。

Method: 构建WebPRM Collection数据集和WebRewardBench评估基准，开发Web-Shepherd PRM模型。

Result: Web-Shepherd在WebRewardBench上比GPT-4o准确率高30分，在WebArena-lite上性能提升10.9分且成本更低。

Conclusion: Web-Shepherd为网页导航提供了高效、低成本的奖励模型解决方案。

Abstract: Web navigation is a unique domain that can automate many repetitive real-life
tasks and is challenging as it requires long-horizon sequential decision making
beyond typical multimodal large language model (MLLM) tasks. Yet, specialized
reward models for web navigation that can be utilized during both training and
test-time have been absent until now. Despite the importance of speed and
cost-effectiveness, prior works have utilized MLLMs as reward models, which
poses significant constraints for real-world deployment. To address this, in
this work, we propose the first process reward model (PRM) called Web-Shepherd
which could assess web navigation trajectories in a step-level. To achieve
this, we first construct the WebPRM Collection, a large-scale dataset with 40K
step-level preference pairs and annotated checklists spanning diverse domains
and difficulty levels. Next, we also introduce the WebRewardBench, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for evaluating PRMs. In our experiments, we observe
that our Web-Shepherd achieves about 30 points better accuracy compared to
using GPT-4o on WebRewardBench. Furthermore, when testing on WebArena-lite by
using GPT-4o-mini as the policy and Web-Shepherd as the verifier, we achieve
10.9 points better performance, in 10 less cost compared to using GPT-4o-mini
as the verifier. Our model, dataset, and code are publicly available at LINK.

Method: RoleRAG通过角色特定令牌优化，将六个模块整合到单一LLM实例中，动态激活不同模块，并引入查询图表示查询分解。

Result: 在五个开放域问答数据集上的实验表明，RoleRAG具有高效性、通用性和灵活性。

Conclusion: RoleRAG为RAG任务提供了一个高效且统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing studies have optimized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) across
various sub-tasks, such as query understanding and retrieval refinement, but
integrating these optimizations into a unified framework remains challenging.
To tackle this problem, this work proposes RoleRAG, a unified RAG framework
that achieves efficient multi-task processing through role-specific token
optimization. RoleRAG comprises six modules, each handling a specific sub-task
within the RAG process. Additionally, we introduce a query graph to represent
the decomposition of the query, which can be dynamically resolved according to
the decomposing state. All modules are driven by the same underlying LLM,
distinguished by task-specific role tokens that are individually optimized.
This design allows RoleRAG to dynamically activate different modules within a
single LLM instance, thereby streamlining deployment and reducing resource
consumption. Experimental results on five open-domain question-answering
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generalizability, and flexibility of
our framework.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a widely adopted inference-time strategy for
boosting reasoning performance. However, its effectiveness has been studied
almost exclusively in English, leaving its behavior in other languages largely
unexplored. We present the first systematic study of test-time scaling in
multilingual settings, evaluating DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLama-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B across both high- and low-resource Latin-script
languages. Our findings reveal that the relative gains from test-time scaling
vary significantly across languages. Additionally, models frequently switch to
English mid-reasoning, even when operating under strictly monolingual prompts.
We further show that low-resource languages not only produce initial reasoning
thoughts that differ significantly from English but also have lower internal
consistency across generations in their early reasoning. Building on our
findings, we introduce MITT (Multilingual Initial Thought Transfer), an
unsupervised and lightweight reasoning prefix-tuning approach that transfers
high-resource reasoning prefixes to enhance test-time scaling across all
languages, addressing inconsistencies in multilingual reasoning performance.
MITT significantly boosts DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B's reasoning performance,

Abstract: Critical questions are essential resources to provoke critical thinking when

generate critical questions guided by Walton's argumentation schemes. For each
input intervention, we conversationally prompt LLMs to instantiate the
corresponding argument scheme template to first obtain structured arguments,
and then generate relevant critical questions. Following this, we rank all the
available critical questions by prompting LLMs to select the top 3 most helpful
questions based on the original intervention text. This combination of
structured argumentation theory and step-by-step reasoning enables the
generation of contextually relevant and diverse critical questions. Our
pipeline achieves competitive performance in the final test set, showing its
potential to foster critical thinking given argumentative text and detect

Motivation: 当前语音语言模型通常局限于轮式交互，缺乏实时适应性（如用户打断）。本文旨在解决这一问题，实现更自然的对话交互。

Method: 采用预训练的流式编码器处理用户输入，分离用户和代理建模架构，优化代理语音质量并降低比特率（0.6 kbps）。

Result: 模型在推理、轮转和打断能力上优于以往双工模型，且所需语音数据更少。

Conclusion: 该模型是首个公开可用的双工S2S模型，提供了训练和推理代码以促进可复现性。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue is an intuitive form of human-computer interaction, yet
current speech language models often remain constrained to turn-based
exchanges, lacking real-time adaptability such as user barge-in. We propose a
novel duplex speech to speech (S2S) architecture featuring continuous user
inputs and codec agent outputs with channel fusion that directly models
simultaneous user and agent streams. Using a pretrained streaming encoder for
user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech
pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec
fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared
to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in
abilities. The model requires significantly less speech data, as speech
pretrain is skipped, which markedly simplifies the process of building a duplex
S2S model from any LLMs. Finally, it is the first openly available duplex S2S
model with training and inference code to foster reproducibility.

Result: PsyLLM在全面性、专业性、真实性和安全性四个维度上显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: PsyLLM为心理健康咨询提供了更系统、临床对齐的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold significant potential for mental health
support, capable of generating empathetic responses and simulating therapeutic
conversations. However, existing LLM-based approaches often lack the clinical
grounding necessary for real-world psychological counseling, particularly in
explicit diagnostic reasoning aligned with standards like the DSM/ICD and
incorporating diverse therapeutic modalities beyond basic empathy or single
strategies. To address these critical limitations, we propose PsyLLM, the first
large language model designed to systematically integrate both diagnostic and
therapeutic reasoning for mental health counseling. To develop the PsyLLM, we
propose a novel automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline processes
real-world mental health posts, generates multi-turn dialogue structures, and
leverages LLMs guided by international diagnostic standards (e.g., DSM/ICD) and
multiple therapeutic frameworks (e.g., CBT, ACT, psychodynamic) to simulate
detailed clinical reasoning processes. Rigorous multi-dimensional filtering
ensures the generation of high-quality, clinically aligned dialogue data. In
addition, we introduce a new benchmark and evaluation protocol, assessing
counseling quality across four key dimensions: comprehensiveness,
professionalism, authenticity, and safety. Our experiments demonstrate that
PsyLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models on this
benchmark.

Conclusion: MAATS通过模块化代理与可解释的MQM维度结合，缩小了黑盒LLMs与人工翻译流程的差距，提升了语义和上下文保真度。

Abstract: We present MAATS, a Multi Agent Automated Translation System that leverages
the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework as a fine-grained signal
for error detection and refinement. MAATS employs multiple specialized AI
agents, each focused on a distinct MQM category (e.g., Accuracy, Fluency,
Style, Terminology), followed by a synthesis agent that integrates the
annotations to iteratively refine translations. This design contrasts with
conventional single-agent methods that rely on self-correction.
  Evaluated across diverse language pairs and Large Language Models (LLMs),
MAATS outperforms zero-shot and single-agent baselines with statistically
significant gains in both automatic metrics and human assessments. It excels
particularly in semantic accuracy, locale adaptation, and linguistically
distant language pairs. Qualitative analysis highlights its strengths in
multi-layered error diagnosis, omission detection across perspectives, and
context-aware refinement. By aligning modular agent roles with interpretable
MQM dimensions, MAATS narrows the gap between black-box LLMs and human
translation workflows, shifting focus from surface fluency to deeper semantic

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) involves retrieving relevant tables from a
large corpus to answer natural language queries. Traditional dense retrieval
models, such as DTR and ColBERT, not only incur high computational costs for
large-scale retrieval tasks but also require retraining or fine-tuning on new
datasets, limiting their adaptability to evolving domains and knowledge. In
this work, we propose $\textbf{CRAFT}$, a cascaded retrieval approach that
first uses a sparse retrieval model to filter a subset of candidate tables
before applying more computationally expensive dense models and neural
re-rankers. Our approach achieves better retrieval performance than
state-of-the-art (SOTA) sparse, dense, and hybrid retrievers. We further
enhance table representations by generating table descriptions and titles using
Gemini Flash 1.5. End-to-end TQA results using various Large Language Models
(LLMs) on NQ-Tables, a subset of the Natural Questions Dataset, demonstrate
$\textbf{CRAFT}$ effectiveness.

trauma-informed, empathetic dialogue for individuals with PTSD? We address this
question by introducing TIDE, a dataset of 10,000 two-turn dialogues spanning
500 diverse PTSD client personas and grounded in a three-factor empathy model:
emotion recognition, distress normalization, and supportive reflection. All
scenarios and reference responses were reviewed for realism and trauma
sensitivity by a clinical psychologist specializing in PTSD. We evaluate eight
small language models before and after fine-tuning, comparing their outputs to
a frontier model (Claude Sonnet 3.5). Our IRB-approved human evaluation and
automatic metrics show that fine-tuning generally improves perceived empathy,
but gains are highly scenario- and user-dependent, with smaller models facing
an empathy ceiling. Demographic analysis shows older adults value distress
validation and graduate-educated users prefer nuanced replies, while gender
effects are minimal. We highlight the limitations of automatic metrics and the
need for context- and user-aware system design. Our findings, along with the
planned release of TIDE, provide a foundation for building safe,
resource-efficient, and ethically sound empathetic AI to supplement, not
replace, clinical mental health care.

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) is crucial for evaluating the model's
capability to integrate information from diverse sources. However, creating
extensive and high-quality MHQA datasets is challenging: (i) manual annotation
is expensive, and (ii) current synthesis methods often produce simplistic
questions or require extensive manual guidance. This paper introduces
HopWeaver, the first automatic framework synthesizing authentic multi-hop
questions from unstructured text corpora without human intervention. HopWeaver
synthesizes two types of multi-hop questions (bridge and comparison) using an
innovative approach that identifies complementary documents across corpora. Its
coherent pipeline constructs authentic reasoning paths that integrate
information across multiple documents, ensuring synthesized questions
necessitate authentic multi-hop reasoning. We further present a comprehensive
system for evaluating synthesized multi-hop questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that the synthesized questions achieve comparable or superior
quality to human-annotated datasets at a lower cost. Our approach is valuable
for developing MHQA datasets in specialized domains with scarce annotated
resources. The code for HopWeaver is publicly available.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Intelligent Virtual
Agents acting as psychotherapists presents significant opportunities for
expanding mental healthcare access. However, their deployment has also been
linked to serious adverse outcomes, including user harm and suicide,
facilitated by a lack of standardized evaluation methodologies capable of
capturing the nuanced risks of therapeutic interaction. Current evaluation
techniques lack the sensitivity to detect subtle changes in patient cognition
and behavior during therapy sessions that may lead to subsequent
decompensation. We introduce a novel risk taxonomy specifically designed for
the systematic evaluation of conversational AI psychotherapists. Developed
through an iterative process including review of the psychotherapy risk
literature, qualitative interviews with clinical and legal experts, and
alignment with established clinical criteria (e.g., DSM-5) and existing
assessment tools (e.g., NEQ, UE-ATR), the taxonomy aims to provide a structured
approach to identifying and assessing user/patient harms. We provide a
high-level overview of this taxonomy, detailing its grounding, and discuss
potential use cases. We discuss two use cases in detail: monitoring cognitive
model-based risk factors during a counseling conversation to detect unsafe
deviations, in both human-AI counseling sessions and in automated benchmarking
of AI psychotherapists with simulated patients. The proposed taxonomy offers a
foundational step towards establishing safer and more responsible innovation in
the domain of AI-driven mental health support.

Conclusion: 论文为电子商务脚本规划提供了新框架和数据集，揭示了LLMs在此任务上的局限性及改进方向。

Abstract: Goal-oriented script planning, or the ability to devise coherent sequences of
actions toward specific goals, is commonly employed by humans to plan for
typical activities. In e-commerce, customers increasingly seek LLM-based
assistants to generate scripts and recommend products at each step, thereby
facilitating convenient and efficient shopping experiences. However, this
capability remains underexplored due to several challenges, including the
inability of LLMs to simultaneously conduct script planning and product
retrieval, difficulties in matching products caused by semantic discrepancies
between planned actions and search queries, and a lack of methods and benchmark
data for evaluation. In this paper, we step forward by formally defining the
task of E-commerce Script Planning (EcomScript) as three sequential subtasks.
We propose a novel framework that enables the scalable generation of
product-enriched scripts by associating products with each step based on the
semantic similarity between the actions and their purchase intentions. By
applying our framework to real-world e-commerce data, we construct the very
first large-scale EcomScript dataset, EcomScriptBench, which includes 605,229
scripts sourced from 2.4 million products. Human annotations are then conducted
to provide gold labels for a sampled subset, forming an evaluation benchmark.
Extensive experiments reveal that current (L)LMs face significant challenges
with EcomScript tasks, even after fine-tuning, while injecting product purchase
intentions improves their performance.

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have emerged as the preferred
tools for judging text-image alignment, yet their robustness along the visual
modality remains underexplored. This work is the first study to address a key
research question: Can adversarial visual manipulations systematically fool
LVLM judges into assigning unfairly inflated scores? We define potential image
induced biases within the context of T2I evaluation and examine how these
biases affect the evaluations of LVLM judges. Moreover, we introduce a novel,
fine-grained, multi-domain meta-evaluation benchmark named FRAME, which is
deliberately constructed to exhibit diverse score distributions. By introducing
the defined biases into the benchmark, we reveal that all tested LVLM judges
exhibit vulnerability across all domains, consistently inflating scores for
manipulated images. Further analysis reveals that combining multiple biases
amplifies their effects, and pairwise evaluations are similarly susceptible.
Moreover, we observe that visual biases persist under prompt-based mitigation
strategies, highlighting the vulnerability of current LVLM evaluation systems
and underscoring the urgent need for more robust LVLM judges.

Motivation: 心理操纵隐蔽且复杂，现有LLM难以检测，且缺乏高质量标注数据。

Method: 提出MentalMAC方法，包括EvoSA数据扩展、多任务监督和渐进知识蒸馏，构建ReaMent数据集。

Result: 方法显著缩小师生模型差距，在关键指标上优于竞争LLM。

Conclusion: MentalMAC有效提升LLM检测心理操纵的能力，为相关研究提供数据和工具支持。

Abstract: Mental manipulation is a subtle yet pervasive form of psychological abuse
that poses serious threats to mental health. Its covert nature and the
complexity of manipulation strategies make it challenging to detect, even for
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). This concealment also hinders
the manual collection of large-scale, high-quality annotations essential for
training effective models. Although recent efforts have sought to improve LLM's
performance on this task, progress remains limited due to the scarcity of
real-world annotated datasets. To address these challenges, we propose
MentalMAC, a multi-task anti-curriculum distillation method that enhances LLMs'
ability to detect mental manipulation in multi-turn dialogue. Our approach
includes: (i) EvoSA, an unsupervised data expansion method based on
evolutionary operations and speech act theory; (ii) teacher-model-generated
multi-task supervision; and (iii) progressive knowledge distillation from
complex to simpler tasks. We then constructed the ReaMent dataset with 5,000
real-world dialogue samples, using a MentalMAC-distilled model to assist human
annotation. Vast experiments demonstrate that our method significantly narrows
the gap between student and teacher models and outperforms competitive LLMs
across key evaluation metrics. All code, datasets, and checkpoints will be
released upon paper acceptance. Warning: This paper contains content that may

Result: VLMs对表情包有害提示的脆弱性显著高于合成或文字图像，表情包显著增加有害响应并减少拒绝率，多轮交互仅部分缓解问题。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要更生态有效的评估和更强的安全机制。

Abstract: Rapid deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) magnifies safety risks, yet
most evaluations rely on artificial images. This study asks: How safe are
current VLMs when confronted with meme images that ordinary users share? To
investigate this question, we introduce MemeSafetyBench, a 50,430-instance
benchmark pairing real meme images with both harmful and benign instructions.
Using a comprehensive safety taxonomy and LLM-based instruction generation, we
assess multiple VLMs across single and multi-turn interactions. We investigate
how real-world memes influence harmful outputs, the mitigating effects of
conversational context, and the relationship between model scale and safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs show greater vulnerability to
meme-based harmful prompts than to synthetic or typographic images. Memes
significantly increase harmful responses and decrease refusals compared to
text-only inputs. Though multi-turn interactions provide partial mitigation,
elevated vulnerability persists. These results highlight the need for
ecologically valid evaluations and stronger safety mechanisms.

Method: 提出三种改进：(i)跨层对[CLS]令牌进行最大池化，(ii)通过额外MHA层使[CLS]令牌关注最终层，(iii)结合序列最大池化和MHA。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中，MaxPoolBERT性能优于标准BERT-base，尤其适用于低资源任务。

Conclusion: MaxPoolBERT是一种轻量级扩展，显著提升BERT分类性能，无需预训练或显著增加模型规模。

Abstract: The [CLS] token in BERT is commonly used as a fixed-length representation for
classification tasks, yet prior work has shown that both other tokens and
intermediate layers encode valuable contextual information. In this work, we
propose MaxPoolBERT, a lightweight extension to BERT that refines the [CLS]
representation by aggregating information across layers and tokens.
Specifically, we explore three modifications: (i) max-pooling the [CLS] token
across multiple layers, (ii) enabling the [CLS] token to attend over the entire
final layer using an additional multi-head attention (MHA) layer, and (iii)
combining max-pooling across the full sequence with MHA. Our approach enhances
BERT's classification accuracy (especially on low-resource tasks) without
requiring pre-training or significantly increasing model size. Experiments on
the GLUE benchmark show that MaxPoolBERT consistently achieves a better
performance on the standard BERT-base model.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the
development of multi-modal models capable of vocal communication. Unlike
text-based interactions, speech conveys rich and diverse information, including
semantic content, acoustic variations, paralanguage cues, and environmental
context. However, existing evaluations of speech interaction models

performance, conversational abilities, and robustness. It covers 16 fundamental
skills essential for effective vocal interaction. Experimental results reveal
significant variability in current model capabilities, each exhibiting distinct

Conclusion: ConvSearch-R1为对话搜索系统提供了一种高效、自监督的查询重写解决方案。

Abstract: Conversational search systems require effective handling of context-dependent
queries that often contain ambiguity, omission, and coreference. Conversational
Query Reformulation (CQR) addresses this challenge by transforming these
queries into self-contained forms suitable for off-the-shelf retrievers.
However, existing CQR approaches suffer from two critical constraints: high
dependency on costly external supervision from human annotations or large
language models, and insufficient alignment between the rewriting model and
downstream retrievers. We present ConvSearch-R1, the first self-driven
framework that completely eliminates dependency on external rewrite supervision
by leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize reformulation directly through
retrieval signals. Our novel two-stage approach combines Self-Driven Policy
Warm-Up to address the cold-start problem through retrieval-guided
self-distillation, followed by Retrieval-Guided Reinforcement Learning with a
specially designed rank-incentive reward shaping mechanism that addresses the
sparsity issue in conventional retrieval metrics. Extensive experiments on
TopiOCQA and QReCC datasets demonstrate that ConvSearch-R1 significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 10% improvement
on the challenging TopiOCQA dataset while using smaller 3B parameter models
without any external supervision.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for autonomous driving, yet their

overcome this, we introduce \textbf{AgentThink}, a pioneering unified framework
that, for the first time, integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with
dynamic, agent-style tool invocation for autonomous driving tasks. AgentThink's
core innovations include: \textbf{(i) Structured Data Generation}, by
establishing an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct
structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage
for diverse driving scenarios; \textbf{(ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline},
employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to equip VLMs with the capability for autonomous tool invocation; and
\textbf{(iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation}, introducing a novel
multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool
invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark
demonstrate AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by
\textbf{53.91\%} and enhances answer accuracy by \textbf{33.54\%}, while
markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation
studies and robust zero-shot/few-shot generalization experiments across various
benchmarks underscore its powerful capabilities. These findings highlight a

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in hardware
design tasks, such as Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation and
debugging. Yet, their performance in real-world, repository-level HDL projects

Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) with LLMs, introducing HDL-specific graph
representations by incorporating Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and Data Flow
Graphs (DFGs) to capture both code graph view and hardware graph view.
HDLxGraph utilizes a dual-retrieval mechanism that not only mitigates the
limited recall issues inherent in similarity-based semantic retrieval by
incorporating structural information, but also enhances its extensibility to
various real-world tasks by a task-specific retrieval finetuning. Additionally,
to address the lack of comprehensive HDL search benchmarks, we introduce
HDLSearch, a multi-granularity evaluation dataset derived from real-world
repository-level projects. Experimental results demonstrate that HDLxGraph
significantly improves average search accuracy, debugging efficiency and
completion quality by 12.04%, 12.22% and 5.04% compared to similarity-based
RAG, respectively. The code of HDLxGraph and collected HDLSearch benchmark are

EC, reviewing their intersections, complementary strengths, and emerging
applications. We identify key opportunities where EC can enhance LLM training,

turn, aid in automating the design, analysis, and interpretation of ECs. The
manuscript explores the synergistic integration of EC and LLMs, highlighting
their bidirectional contributions to advancing artificial intelligence. It
first examines how EC techniques enhance LLMs by optimizing key components such
as prompt engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and architecture search,
demonstrating how evolutionary methods automate and refine these processes.
Secondly, the survey investigates how LLMs improve EC by automating
metaheuristic design, tuning evolutionary algorithms, and generating adaptive

co-evolutionary frameworks are discussed, showcasing applications across
diverse fields while acknowledging challenges like computational costs,
interpretability, and algorithmic convergence. The survey concludes by
identifying open research questions and advocating for hybrid approaches that

Conclusion: 人类和语言模型在具体性维度上趋同，表明语言模型能够捕捉这一重要语义特征。

Abstract: The nouns of our language refer to either concrete entities (like a table) or
abstract concepts (like justice or love), and cognitive psychology has
established that concreteness influences how words are processed. Accordingly,
understanding how concreteness is represented in our mind and brain is a
central question in psychology, neuroscience, and computational linguistics.
While the advent of powerful language models has allowed for quantitative
inquiries into the nature of semantic representations, it remains largely
underexplored how they represent concreteness. Here, we used behavioral
judgments to estimate semantic distances implicitly used by humans, for a set
of carefully selected abstract and concrete nouns. Using Representational
Similarity Analysis, we find that the implicit representational space of
participants and the semantic representations of language models are
significantly aligned. We also find that both representational spaces are
implicitly aligned to an explicit representation of concreteness, which was
obtained from our participants using an additional concreteness rating task.
Importantly, using ablation experiments, we demonstrate that the human-to-model
alignment is substantially driven by concreteness, but not by other important
word characteristics established in psycholinguistics. These results indicate
that humans and language models converge on the concreteness dimension, but not
on other dimensions.

to convert healthy non-English speech (FLEURS) into non-English dysarthric-like
speech. The generated data is then used to fine-tune a multilingual ASR model,
Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS), for improved dysarthric speech
recognition. Evaluation on PC-GITA (Spanish), EasyCall (Italian), and SSNCE

significantly outperforms the off-the-shelf MMS performance and conventional
augmentation techniques such as speed and tempo perturbation. Objective and

Abstract: Winning competitive debates requires sophisticated reasoning and argument
skills. There are unique challenges in the competitive debate: (1) The time
constraints force debaters to make strategic choices about which points to
pursue rather than covering all possible arguments; (2) The persuasiveness of
the debate relies on the back-and-forth interaction between arguments, which a
single final game status cannot evaluate. To address these challenges, we
propose TreeDebater, a novel debate framework that excels in competitive
debate. We introduce two tree structures: the Rehearsal Tree and Debate Flow
Tree. The Rehearsal Tree anticipates the attack and defenses to evaluate the
strength of the claim, while the Debate Flow Tree tracks the debate status to
identify the active actions. TreeDebater allocates its time budget among
candidate actions and uses the speech time controller and feedback from the
simulated audience to revise its statement. The human evaluation on both the
stage-level and the debate-level comparison shows that our TreeDebater
outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-agent debate system. Further
investigation shows that TreeDebater shows better strategies in limiting time

Abstract: Knowledge understanding is a foundational part of envisioned 6G networks to
advance network intelligence and AI-native network architectures. In this
paradigm, information extraction plays a pivotal role in transforming
fragmented telecom knowledge into well-structured formats, empowering diverse
AI models to better understand network terminologies. This work proposes a
novel language model-based information extraction technique, aiming to extract
structured entities from the telecom context. The proposed telecom structured
entity extraction (TeleSEE) technique applies a token-efficient representation
method to predict entity types and attribute keys, aiming to save the number of
output tokens and improve prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, TeleSEE involves a
hierarchical parallel decoding method, improving the standard encoder-decoder
architecture by integrating additional prompting and decoding strategies into
entity extraction tasks. In addition, to better evaluate the performance of the
proposed technique in the telecom domain, we further designed a dataset named
6GTech, including 2390 sentences and 23747 words from more than 100 6G-related
technical publications. Finally, the experiment shows that the proposed TeleSEE
method achieves higher accuracy than other baseline techniques, and also

Conclusion: MolLangBench揭示了AI系统在化学任务中的不足，希望促进更可靠化学AI系统的研究。

Abstract: Precise recognition, editing, and generation of molecules are essential
prerequisites for both chemists and AI systems tackling various chemical tasks.
We present MolLangBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
fundamental molecule-language interface tasks: language-prompted molecular
structure recognition, editing, and generation. To ensure high-quality,
unambiguous, and deterministic outputs, we construct the recognition tasks
using automated cheminformatics tools, and curate editing and generation tasks
through rigorous expert annotation and validation. MolLangBench supports the
evaluation of models that interface language with different molecular
representations, including linear strings, molecular images, and molecular
graphs. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal significant limitations:
the strongest model (o3) achieves $79.2\%$ and $78.5\%$ accuracy on recognition
and editing tasks, which are intuitively simple for humans, and performs even
worse on the generation task, reaching only $29.0\%$ accuracy. These results
highlight the shortcomings of current AI systems in handling even preliminary
molecular recognition and manipulation tasks. We hope MolLangBench will
catalyze further research toward more effective and reliable AI systems for
chemical applications.

Motivation: 低资源语言的NMT系统在领域适应任务中面临数据不足和模型泛化差的挑战，需要一种无需微调即可选择最优模型的方法。

Method: 采用基于bandit的算法（如UCB、Linear UCB、Neural Linear Bandit和Thompson Sampling）进行模型选择。

Result: 在三种非洲语言和多个领域的实验中，该方法在有无目标数据的情况下均表现出鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 基于bandit的算法能有效解决低资源语言NMT模型选择问题，尤其在无法微调的场景下。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems face significant challenges when
working with low-resource languages, particularly in domain adaptation tasks.
These difficulties arise due to limited training data and suboptimal model
generalization, As a result, selecting an optimal model for translation is
crucial for achieving strong performance on in-domain data, particularly in
scenarios where fine-tuning is not feasible or practical. In this paper, we
investigate strategies for selecting the most suitable NMT model for a given
domain using bandit-based algorithms, including Upper Confidence Bound, Linear
UCB, Neural Linear Bandit, and Thompson Sampling. Our method effectively
addresses the resource constraints by facilitating optimal model selection with
high confidence. We evaluate the approach across three African languages and
domains, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in both scenarios where
target data is available and where it is absent.

Motivation: 讽刺因陈述与隐含情感的不一致而对情感分析构成挑战，尤其是涉及特定国家或地区时。研究旨在利用PMP改进讽刺检测的可解释性。

Method: 利用PMP对澳大利亚和印度英语数据集BESSTIE进行讽刺解释标注，并与标准英语数据集FLUTE比较。测试基于GEMMA和LLAMA两种开源LLM。

Result: PMP在所有任务和数据集上均显著优于其他四种提示策略。代理提示等技术通过外部知识检索缓解了上下文相关失败。

Conclusion: PMP能有效生成多样英语的讽刺解释，提升检测性能。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a challenge to sentiment analysis because of the incongruity
between stated and implied sentiment. The challenge is exacerbated when the
implication may be relevant to a specific country or geographical region.
Pragmatic metacognitive prompting (PMP) is a cognition-inspired technique that
has been used for pragmatic reasoning. In this paper, we harness PMP for
explainable sarcasm detection for Australian and Indian English, alongside a
benchmark dataset for standard English. We manually add sarcasm explanations to
an existing sarcasm-labeled dataset for Australian and Indian English called
BESSTIE, and compare the performance for explainable sarcasm detection for them
with FLUTE, a standard English dataset containing sarcasm explanations. Our
approach utilising PMP when evaluated on two open-weight LLMs (GEMMA and LLAMA)
achieves statistically significant performance improvement across all tasks and
datasets when compared with four alternative prompting strategies. We also find
that alternative techniques such as agentic prompting mitigate context-related
failures by enabling external knowledge retrieval. The focused contribution of
our work is utilising PMP in generating sarcasm explanations for varieties of
English.

Motivation: 现有IIMT研究多基于简化场景（如单行黑字白底图像），与现实应用差距较大。为提升IIMT的实际价值，需考虑复杂场景（如真实世界图像背景）。

Method: 提出DebackX模型，分离背景与文本图像，直接翻译文本图像后与背景融合生成目标图像。

Result: 实验表明，模型在翻译质量和视觉效果上均有提升。

Conclusion: DebackX模型为复杂场景IIMT提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate texts within images
from one language to another. Previous research on IIMT was primarily conducted
on simplified scenarios such as images of one-line text with black font in
white backgrounds, which is far from reality and impractical for applications
in the real world. To make IIMT research practically valuable, it is essential
to consider a complex scenario where the text backgrounds are derived from
real-world images. To facilitate research of complex scenario IIMT, we design
an IIMT dataset that includes subtitle text with real-world background. However
previous IIMT models perform inadequately in complex scenarios. To address the
issue, we propose the DebackX model, which separates the background and
text-image from the source image, performs translation on text-image directly,
and fuses the translated text-image with the background, to generate the target
image. Experimental results show that our model achieves improvements in both
translation quality and visual effect.

Result: 实验证明DPKG在多跳问题生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: DPKG框架通过双视角关键词的协同作用，显著提升了多跳问题生成的性能。

Abstract: Multi-hop question generation (MQG) aims to generate questions that require
synthesizing multiple information snippets from documents to derive target
answers. The primary challenge lies in effectively pinpointing crucial
information snippets related to question-answer (QA) pairs, typically relying
on keywords. However, existing works fail to fully utilize the guiding
potential of keywords and neglect to differentiate the distinct roles of
question-specific and document-specific keywords. To address this, we define
dual-perspective keywords (i.e., question and document keywords) and propose a
Dual-Perspective Keyword-Guided (DPKG) framework, which seamlessly integrates
keywords into the multi-hop question generation process. We argue that question
keywords capture the questioner's intent, whereas document keywords reflect the
content related to the QA pair. Functionally, question and document keywords
work together to pinpoint essential information snippets in the document, with
question keywords required to appear in the generated question. The DPKG
framework consists of an expanded transformer encoder and two answer-aware
transformer decoders for keyword and question generation, respectively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our work, showcasing its
promising performance and underscoring its significant value in the MQG task.

Conclusion: LLMs在情感支持对话任务中具有潜力，尤其是在多策略生成方面表现突出。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversations (ESC) are crucial for providing empathy,
validation, and actionable guidance to individuals in distress. However,
existing definitions of the ESC task oversimplify the structure of supportive
responses, typically modelling them as single strategy-utterance pairs. Through
a detailed corpus analysis of the ESConv dataset, we identify a common yet
previously overlooked phenomenon: emotional supporters often employ multiple
strategies consecutively within a single turn. We formally redefine the ESC
task to account for this, proposing a revised formulation that requires
generating the full sequence of strategy-utterance pairs given a dialogue
history. To facilitate this refined task, we introduce several modelling
approaches, including supervised deep learning models and large language
models. Our experiments show that, under this redefined task, state-of-the-art
LLMs outperform both supervised models and human supporters. Notably, contrary
to some earlier findings, we observe that LLMs frequently ask questions and
provide suggestions, demonstrating more holistic support capabilities.

Conclusion: 单元语言和任务提示建模有效解决了S2ST的跨模态和跨语言挑战，为无文本语音翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: The success of building textless speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) models
has attracted much attention. However, S2ST still faces two main challenges: 1)
extracting linguistic features for various speech signals, called cross-modal
(CM), and 2) learning alignment of difference languages in long sequences,
called cross-lingual (CL). We propose the unit language to overcome the two
modeling challenges. The unit language can be considered a text-like
representation format, constructed using $n$-gram language modeling. We
implement multi-task learning to utilize the unit language in guiding the
speech modeling process. Our initial results reveal a conflict when applying
source and target unit languages simultaneously. We propose task prompt
modeling to mitigate this conflict. We conduct experiments on four languages of
the Voxpupil dataset. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over a
strong baseline and achieves performance comparable to models trained with

Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential
for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical
communication technologies. In this study, we investigated
magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during
speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks.
Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone
classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine
learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network
architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding
phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding
accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and
playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available
during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently
outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of
traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and
high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency
bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz)
and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy,
suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural
processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether
decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement
artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological
refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of
examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity,
offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals
with severe speech impairments.

Abstract: The remarkable ability of diffusion models to generate high-fidelity images
has led to their widespread adoption. However, concerns have also arisen
regarding their potential to produce Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content and
exhibit social biases, hindering their practical use in real-world
applications. In response to this challenge, prior work has focused on
employing security filters to identify and exclude toxic text, or
alternatively, fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models to erase sensitive
concepts. Unfortunately, existing methods struggle to achieve satisfactory
performance in the sense that they can have a significant impact on the normal
model output while still failing to prevent the generation of harmful content
in some cases. In this paper, we propose a novel self-discovery approach to
identifying a semantic direction vector in the embedding space to restrict text
embedding within a safe region. Our method circumvents the need for correcting
individual words within the input text and steers the entire text prompt
towards a safe region in the embedding space, thereby enhancing model
robustness against all possibly unsafe prompts. In addition, we employ Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) for semantic direction vector initialization to reduce the
impact on the model performance for other semantics. Furthermore, our method
can also be integrated with existing methods to improve their social
responsibility. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our method can effectively reduce NSFW content and mitigate social bias
generated by diffusion models compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Recent Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents replicate the R1-Zero paradigm,
coupling online Reinforcement Learning (RL) with explicit chain-of-thought
reasoning prior to object grounding and thereby achieving substantial
performance gains. In this paper, we first conduct extensive analysis
experiments of three key components of that training pipeline: input design,
output evaluation, and policy update-each revealing distinct challenges arising
from blindly applying general-purpose RL without adapting to GUI grounding
tasks. Input design: Current templates encourage the model to generate
chain-of-thought reasoning, but longer chains unexpectedly lead to worse
grounding performance. Output evaluation: Reward functions based on hit signals
or box area allow models to exploit box size, leading to reward hacking and
poor localization quality. Policy update: Online RL tends to overfit easy
examples due to biases in length and sample difficulty, leading to
under-optimization on harder cases. To address these issues, we propose three
targeted solutions. First, we adopt a Fast Thinking Template that encourages
direct answer generation, reducing excessive reasoning during training. Second,
we incorporate a box size constraint into the reward function to mitigate
reward hacking. Third, we revise the RL objective by adjusting length
normalization and adding a difficulty-aware scaling factor, enabling better
optimization on hard samples. Our GUI-G1-3B, trained on 17K public samples with
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, achieves 90.3% accuracy on ScreenSpot and 37.1% on
ScreenSpot-Pro. This surpasses all prior models of similar size and even
outperforms the larger UI-TARS-7B, establishing a new state-of-the-art in GUI
agent grounding. The project repository is available at

Abstract: Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding developer
interactions, issue resolutions, and project dynamics within software
engineering (SE). While traditional SE-specific sentiment analysis tools have
made significant strides, they often fail to account for the nuanced and
context-dependent language inherent to the domain. This study systematically
evaluates the performance of bidirectional transformers, such as BERT, against
generative pre-trained transformers, specifically GPT-4o-mini, in SE sentiment
analysis. Using datasets from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Jira, we benchmark
the models' capabilities with fine-tuned and default configurations. The
results reveal that fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini performs comparable to BERT and
other bidirectional models on structured and balanced datasets like GitHub and
Jira, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.93 and 0.98, respectively.
However, on linguistically complex datasets with imbalanced sentiment
distributions, such as Stack Overflow, the default GPT-4o-mini model exhibits
superior generalization, achieving an accuracy of 85.3\% compared to the
fine-tuned model's 13.1\%. These findings highlight the trade-offs between
fine-tuning and leveraging pre-trained models for SE tasks. The study
underscores the importance of aligning model architectures with dataset
characteristics to optimize performance and proposes directions for future
research in refining sentiment analysis tools tailored to the SE domain.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的正则化方法DF-FLOPS，用于减少高文档频率（DF）术语的使用，从而降低检索延迟，同时保持检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高DF术语在生产检索引擎中会增加延迟，现有方法如FLOPS正则化无法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出DF-FLOPS正则化技术，通过惩罚高DF术语的使用来缩短发布列表并减少延迟。

Result: DF-FLOPS显著减少了高DF术语的使用，检索延迟降低约10倍，同时保持检索效果。

Conclusion: DF-FLOPS为LSR在生产级搜索引擎中的实际部署提供了重要步骤。

Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) models encode text as weighted term vectors,
which need to be sparse to leverage inverted index structures during retrieval.
SPLADE, the most popular LSR model, uses FLOPS regularization to encourage
vector sparsity during training. However, FLOPS regularization does not ensure
sparsity among terms - only within a given query or document. Terms with very
high Document Frequencies (DFs) substantially increase latency in production
retrieval engines, such as Apache Solr, due to their lengthy posting lists. To
address the issue of high DFs, we present a new variant of FLOPS
regularization: DF-FLOPS. This new regularization technique penalizes the usage
of high-DF terms, thereby shortening posting lists and reducing retrieval
latency. Unlike other inference-time sparsification methods, such as stopword
removal, DF-FLOPS regularization allows for the selective inclusion of
high-frequency terms in cases where the terms are truly salient. We find that
DF-FLOPS successfully reduces the prevalence of high-DF terms and lowers
retrieval latency (around 10x faster) in a production-grade engine while
maintaining effectiveness both in-domain (only a 2.2-point drop in MRR@10) and
cross-domain (improved performance in 12 out of 13 tasks on which we tested).
With retrieval latencies on par with BM25, this work provides an important step
towards making LSR practical for deployment in production-grade search engines.

Method: 构建MIRB基准，包含四个任务（语义陈述检索、问答检索、前提检索和公式检索）和12个数据集，评估13种检索模型。

Result: MIRB为数学信息检索系统提供了全面的评估框架，并揭示了该领域的挑战。

Conclusion: MIRB有助于推动针对数学领域的更有效检索模型的开发。

Abstract: Mathematical Information Retrieval (MIR) is the task of retrieving
information from mathematical documents and plays a key role in various
applications, including theorem search in mathematical libraries, answer
retrieval on math forums, and premise selection in automated theorem proving.
However, a unified benchmark for evaluating these diverse retrieval tasks has
been lacking. In this paper, we introduce MIRB (Mathematical Information
Retrieval Benchmark) to assess the MIR capabilities of retrieval models. MIRB
includes four tasks: semantic statement retrieval, question-answer retrieval,
premise retrieval, and formula retrieval, spanning a total of 12 datasets. We
evaluate 13 retrieval models on this benchmark and analyze the challenges
inherent to MIR. We hope that MIRB provides a comprehensive framework for
evaluating MIR systems and helps advance the development of more effective
retrieval models tailored to the mathematical domain.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Segmentation-Variant Codebooks (SVCs)的方法，用于量化语音模型中的不同语言单元，以更好地保留韵律和副语言信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音模型量化方法在压缩和性能提升的同时，往往丢失了韵律和副语言信息（如情感、强调）。增加码本大小虽能部分缓解，但会低效地提高比特率。

Method: 提出SVCs方法，通过在不同语言单元（帧、音素、单词、语句）上量化语音，将其分解为多个特定于片段的离散特征流。

Result: SVCs在多项探测任务中显著更有效地保留了韵律和副语言信息。此外，量化前而非量化后的池化操作能更好地保留片段级信息。

Conclusion: SVCs在保持可理解性的同时，改进了风格实现和质量，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Quantization in SSL speech models (e.g., HuBERT) improves compression and
performance in tasks like language modeling, resynthesis, and text-to-speech
but often discards prosodic and paralinguistic information (e.g., emotion,
prominence). While increasing codebook size mitigates some loss, it
inefficiently raises bitrates. We propose Segmentation-Variant Codebooks
(SVCs), which quantize speech at distinct linguistic units (frame, phone, word,
utterance), factorizing it into multiple streams of segment-specific discrete
features. Our results show that SVCs are significantly more effective at
preserving prosodic and paralinguistic information across probing tasks.
Additionally, we find that pooling before rather than after discretization
better retains segment-level information. Resynthesis experiments further
confirm improved style realization and slightly improved quality while
preserving intelligibility.

Abstract: Acquiring large-scale emotional speech data with strong consistency remains a
challenge for speech synthesis. This paper presents MIKU-PAL, a fully automated
multimodal pipeline for extracting high-consistency emotional speech from

the high-quality, flexible, and consistent annotation from MIKU-PAL, we can
annotate fine-grained speech emotion categories of up to 26 types, validated by

Abstract: Despite extensive research on toxic speech detection in text, a critical gap
remains in handling spoken Mandarin audio. The lack of annotated datasets that
capture the unique prosodic cues and culturally specific expressions in
Mandarin leaves spoken toxicity underexplored. To address this, we introduce
ToxicTone -- the largest public dataset of its kind -- featuring detailed
annotations that distinguish both forms of toxicity (e.g., profanity, bullying)
and sources of toxicity (e.g., anger, sarcasm, dismissiveness). Our data,
sourced from diverse real-world audio and organized into 13 topical categories,
mirrors authentic communication scenarios. We also propose a multimodal
detection framework that integrates acoustic, linguistic, and emotional
features using state-of-the-art speech and emotion encoders. Extensive

underscoring the essential role of speech-specific cues in revealing hidden

Method: 利用NeMo Forced Aligner作为教师模型生成时间戳，引入<|timestamp|>标记训练Canary模型直接预测时间戳。

Result: 在四种语言中，时间戳预测的精度和召回率为80%-90%，误差为20-120毫秒，WER影响小；在自动语音翻译任务中误差约200毫秒。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，适用于多语言任务，性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach for enabling word-level timestamp
prediction in the Canary model. Accurate timestamp information is crucial for a
variety of downstream tasks such as speech content retrieval and timed
subtitles. While traditional hybrid systems and end-to-end (E2E) models may
employ external modules for timestamp prediction, our approach eliminates the
need for separate alignment mechanisms. By leveraging the NeMo Forced Aligner
(NFA) as a teacher model, we generate word-level timestamps and train the
Canary model to predict timestamps directly. We introduce a new <|timestamp|>
token, enabling the Canary model to predict start and end timestamps for each
word. Our method demonstrates precision and recall rates between 80% and 90%,
with timestamp prediction errors ranging from 20 to 120 ms across four
languages, with minimal WER degradation. Additionally, we extend our system to
automatic speech translation (AST) tasks, achieving timestamp prediction errors

Result: 实验表明，TCSinger 2在多个相关任务的主观和客观指标上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: TCSinger 2通过改进边界处理和风格控制，显著提升了零样本歌唱语音合成的性能。

Abstract: Customizable multilingual zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) has various
potential applications in music composition and short video dubbing. However,
existing SVS models overly depend on phoneme and note boundary annotations,
limiting their robustness in zero-shot scenarios and producing poor transitions
between phonemes and notes. Moreover, they also lack effective multi-level
style control via diverse prompts. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
TCSinger 2, a multi-task multilingual zero-shot SVS model with style transfer
and style control based on various prompts. TCSinger 2 mainly includes three
key modules: 1) Blurred Boundary Content (BBC) Encoder, predicts duration,
extends content embedding, and applies masking to the boundaries to enable
smooth transitions. 2) Custom Audio Encoder, uses contrastive learning to
extract aligned representations from singing, speech, and textual prompts. 3)
Flow-based Custom Transformer, leverages Cus-MOE, with F0 supervision,
enhancing both the synthesis quality and style modeling of the generated
singing voice. Experimental results show that TCSinger 2 outperforms baseline
models in both subjective and objective metrics across multiple related tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they lag significantly behind humans in
spatial reasoning. We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual
Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object
transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in
cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from
inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm
with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1
rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive
inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive
evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios.
Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its
unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work
provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning
models. The codes, model weights, and data will be publicly available at

Abstract: Large multimodal models excel in multimodal tasks but face significant
computational challenges due to excessive computation on visual tokens. Unlike
token reduction methods that focus on token-level redundancy, we identify and
study the computation-level redundancy on vision tokens to ensure no
information loss. Our key insight is that vision tokens from the pretrained
vision encoder do not necessarily require all the heavy operations (e.g.,
self-attention, FFNs) in decoder-only LMMs and could be processed more lightly
with proper designs. We designed a series of experiments to discover and
progressively squeeze out the vision-related computation redundancy. Based on
our findings, we propose ProxyV, a novel approach that utilizes proxy vision
tokens to alleviate the computational burden on original vision tokens. ProxyV
enhances efficiency without compromising performance and can even yield notable
performance gains in scenarios with more moderate efficiency improvements.
Furthermore, the flexibility of ProxyV is demonstrated through its combination
with token reduction methods to boost efficiency further. The code will be made
public at this https://github.com/penghao-wu/ProxyV URL.

Conclusion: LiveVLM为实时视频理解和交互提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了处理能力和速度。

Abstract: Recent developments in Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have enabled
models to process long video sequences and demonstrate remarkable performance.
Nonetheless, studies predominantly focus on offline video question answering,
neglecting memory usage and response speed that are essential in various
real-world applications, such as Deepseek services, autonomous driving, and
robotics. To mitigate these challenges, we propose $\textbf{LiveVLM}$, a
training-free framework specifically designed for streaming, online video
understanding and real-time interaction. Unlike existing works that process
videos only after one question is posed, LiveVLM constructs an innovative
streaming-oriented KV cache to process video streams in real-time, retain
long-term video details and eliminate redundant KVs, ensuring prompt responses
to user queries. For continuous video streams, LiveVLM generates and compresses
video key-value tensors (video KVs) to reserve visual information while
improving memory efficiency. Furthermore, when a new question is proposed,
LiveVLM incorporates an online question-answering process that efficiently
fetches both short-term and long-term visual information, while minimizing
interference from redundant context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
LiveVLM enables the foundation LLaVA-OneVision model to process 44$\times$
number of frames on the same device, and achieves up to 5$\times$ speedup in
response speed compared with SoTA online methods at an input of 256 frames,
while maintaining the same or better model performance.

Dataset), a carefully designed diagnostic benchmark of 200 images (100
contrastive pairs). Each emergency scene is matched with a visually similar but
safe counterpart through multi-stage human verification and iterative
refinement. Using a two-stage protocol - risk identification and emergency
response - we evaluate 14 VLMs (2B-124B parameters) across medical emergencies,
accidents, and natural disasters. Our analysis reveals a systematic
overreaction problem: models excel at identifying real emergencies (70-100
percent success rate) but suffer from an alarming rate of false alarms,
misidentifying 31-96 percent of safe situations as dangerous, with 10 scenarios
failed by all models regardless of scale. This "better-safe-than-sorry" bias
manifests primarily through contextual overinterpretation (88-93 percent of
errors), challenging VLMs' reliability for safety applications. These findings
highlight persistent limitations that are not resolved by increasing model
scale, motivating targeted approaches for improving contextual safety
assessment in visually misleading scenarios.

Motivation: 解决Vision Transformers的高计算和资源需求问题，利用预训练模型减少重新训练成本。

Method: 分两阶段从预训练模型的MLP层提取专家子网络：聚类激活模式并提取对应子网络。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且实用，为预训练模型的轻量化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have emerged as the state-of-the-art models in various
Computer Vision tasks, but their high computational and resource demands pose
significant challenges. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can make these models
more efficient, they often require costly retraining or even training from
scratch. Recent developments aim to reduce these computational costs by
leveraging pretrained networks. These have been shown to produce sparse
activation patterns in the Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) of the encoder
blocks, allowing for conditional activation of only relevant subnetworks for
each sample. Building on this idea, we propose a new method to construct MoE
variants from pretrained models. Our approach extracts expert subnetworks from
the model's MLP layers post-training in two phases. First, we cluster output
activations to identify distinct activation patterns. In the second phase, we
use these clusters to extract the corresponding subnetworks responsible for
producing them. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we demonstrate that these
extracted experts can perform surprisingly well out of the box and require only
minimal fine-tuning to regain 98% of the original performance, all while
reducing MACs and model size, by up to 36% and 32% respectively.

Conclusion: MORALISE为评估VLMs的道德对齐提供了全面基准，推动了模型在道德敏感领域的可靠应用。

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images. Reader
discretion is advised. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated
increasing influence in morally sensitive domains such as autonomous driving
and medical analysis, owing to their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. As these models are deployed in high-stakes real-world
applications, it is of paramount importance to ensure that their outputs align
with human moral values and remain within moral boundaries. However, existing
work on moral alignment either focuses solely on textual modalities or relies
heavily on AI-generated images, leading to distributional biases and reduced
realism. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MORALISE, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the moral alignment of vision-language models (VLMs)
using diverse, expert-verified real-world data. We begin by proposing a
comprehensive taxonomy of 13 moral topics grounded in Turiel's Domain Theory,
spanning the personal, interpersonal, and societal moral domains encountered in
everyday life. Built on this framework, we manually curate 2,481 high-quality
image-text pairs, each annotated with two fine-grained labels: (1) topic
annotation, identifying the violated moral topic(s), and (2) modality
annotation, indicating whether the violation arises from the image or the text.
For evaluation, we encompass two tasks, \textit{moral judgment} and
\textit{moral norm attribution}, to assess models' awareness of moral
violations and their reasoning ability on morally salient content. Extensive
experiments on 19 popular open- and closed-source VLMs show that MORALISE poses
a significant challenge, revealing persistent moral limitations in current
state-of-the-art models. The full benchmark is publicly available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ze1025/MORALISE.

Abstract: Recent advances have explored integrating large language models (LLMs) into
end-to-end autonomous driving systems to enhance generalization and
interpretability. However, most existing approaches are limited to either
driving performance or vision-language reasoning, making it difficult to
achieve both simultaneously. In this paper, we propose ALN-P3, a unified
co-distillation framework that introduces cross-modal alignment between "fast"
vision-based autonomous driving systems and "slow" language-driven reasoning
modules. ALN-P3 incorporates three novel alignment mechanisms: Perception
Alignment (P1A), Prediction Alignment (P2A), and Planning Alignment (P3A),
which explicitly align visual tokens with corresponding linguistic outputs
across the full perception, prediction, and planning stack. All alignment
modules are applied only during training and incur no additional costs during
inference. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks-nuScenes, Nu-X,
TOD3Cap, and nuScenes QA-demonstrate that ALN-P3 significantly improves both
driving decisions and language reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Foundation models have ushered in a new era for multimodal video
understanding by enabling the extraction of rich spatiotemporal and semantic
representations. In this work, we introduce a novel graph-based framework that
integrates a vision-language foundation, leveraging VideoMAE for dynamic visual
encoding and BERT for contextual textual embedding, to address the challenge of
recognizing fine-grained bimanual manipulation actions. Departing from
conventional static graph architectures, our approach constructs an adaptive
multimodal graph where nodes represent frames, objects, and textual
annotations, and edges encode spatial, temporal, and semantic relationships.
These graph structures evolve dynamically based on learned interactions,
allowing for flexible and context-aware reasoning. A task-specific attention
mechanism within a Graph Attention Network further enhances this reasoning by
modulating edge importance based on action semantics. Through extensive
evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the strength
of combining foundation models with dynamic graph-based reasoning for robust
and generalizable action recognition.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅有效探索了LVLMs的敏感语义，还为未来深入研究提供了启发。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks aim to generate malicious inputs that mislead deep
models, but beyond causing model failure, they cannot provide certain
interpretable information such as ``\textit{What content in inputs make models
more likely to fail?}'' However, this information is crucial for researchers to
specifically improve model robustness. Recent research suggests that models may
be particularly sensitive to certain semantics in visual inputs (such as
``wet,'' ``foggy''), making them prone to errors. Inspired by this, in this
paper we conducted the first exploration on large vision-language models
(LVLMs) and found that LVLMs indeed are susceptible to hallucinations and
various errors when facing specific semantic concepts in images. To efficiently
search for these sensitive concepts, we integrated large language models (LLMs)
and text-to-image (T2I) models to propose a novel semantic evolution framework.
Randomly initialized semantic concepts undergo LLM-based crossover and mutation
operations to form image descriptions, which are then converted by T2I models
into visual inputs for LVLMs. The task-specific performance of LVLMs on each
input is quantified as fitness scores for the involved semantics and serves as
reward signals to further guide LLMs in exploring concepts that induce LVLMs.
Extensive experiments on seven mainstream LVLMs and two multimodal tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we provide
interesting findings about the sensitive semantics of LVLMs, aiming to inspire
further in-depth research.

Result: 在五个数据集的三个任务上，SoftHGNN显著提升了性能，高效捕捉了高阶语义。

Conclusion: SoftHGNN为视觉识别任务提供了一种高效且通用的高阶语义建模框架。

Abstract: Visual recognition relies on understanding both the semantics of image tokens
and the complex interactions among them. Mainstream self-attention methods,
while effective at modeling global pair-wise relations, fail to capture
high-order associations inherent in real-world scenes and often suffer from
redundant computation. Hypergraphs extend conventional graphs by modeling
high-order interactions and offer a promising framework for addressing these
limitations. However, existing hypergraph neural networks typically rely on
static and hard hyperedge assignments, leading to excessive and redundant
hyperedges with hard binary vertex memberships that overlook the continuity of
visual semantics. To overcome these issues, we present Soft Hypergraph Neural
Networks (SoftHGNNs), which extend the methodology of hypergraph computation,
to make it truly efficient and versatile in visual recognition tasks. Our
framework introduces the concept of soft hyperedges, where each vertex is
associated with hyperedges via continuous participation weights rather than
hard binary assignments. This dynamic and differentiable association is
achieved by using the learnable hyperedge prototype. Through similarity
measurements between token features and the prototype, the model generates
semantically rich soft hyperedges. SoftHGNN then aggregates messages over soft
hyperedges to capture high-order semantics. To further enhance efficiency when
scaling up the number of soft hyperedges, we incorporate a sparse hyperedge
selection mechanism that activates only the top-k important hyperedges, along
with a load-balancing regularizer to ensure balanced hyperedge utilization.
Experimental results across three tasks on five datasets demonstrate that
SoftHGNN efficiently captures high-order associations in visual scenes,
achieving significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: ViaRL展示了高效、可扩展的意图驱动视频理解能力，适用于多样化任务。

Abstract: Video understanding is inherently intention-driven-humans naturally focus on
relevant frames based on their goals. Recent advancements in multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have enabled flexible query-driven reasoning; however,
video-based frameworks like Video Chain-of-Thought lack direct training signals
to effectively identify relevant frames. Current approaches often rely on
heuristic methods or pseudo-label supervised annotations, which are both costly
and limited in scalability across diverse scenarios. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce ViaRL, the first framework to leverage rule-based
reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing frame selection in intention-driven
video understanding. An iterated amplification strategy is adopted to perform
alternating cyclic training in the video CoT system, where each component
undergoes iterative cycles of refinement to improve its capabilities. ViaRL
utilizes the answer accuracy of a downstream model as a reward signal to train
a frame selector through trial-and-error, eliminating the need for expensive
annotations while closely aligning with human-like learning processes.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, including VideoMME,
LVBench, and MLVU, demonstrate that ViaRL consistently delivers superior
temporal grounding performance and robust generalization across diverse video
understanding tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability. Notably,
ViaRL achieves a nearly 15\% improvement on Needle QA, a subset of MLVU, which
is required to search a specific needle within a long video and regarded as one
of the most suitable benchmarks for evaluating temporal grounding.

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language foundation models like CLIP and ALIGN, which are
pre-trained on large-scale data have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization
to diverse datasets with different classes and even domains. In this work, we
take a step further and analyze whether these models can be adapted to target
datasets having very different distributions and classes compared to what these
models have been trained on, using only a few labeled examples from the target
dataset. In such scenarios, finetuning large pretrained models is challenging
due to problems of overfitting as well as loss of generalization, and has not
been well explored in prior literature. Since, the pre-training data of such
models are unavailable, it is difficult to comprehend the performance on
various downstream datasets. First, we try to answer the question: Given a
target dataset with a few labelled examples, can we estimate whether further
fine-tuning can enhance the performance compared to zero-shot evaluation? by
analyzing the common vision-language embedding space. Based on the analysis, we
propose a novel prompt-tuning method, PromptMargin for adapting such
large-scale VLMs directly on the few target samples. PromptMargin effectively
tunes the text as well as visual prompts for this task, and has two main
modules: 1) Firstly, we use a selective augmentation strategy to complement the
few training samples in each task; 2) Additionally, to ensure robust training
in the presence of unfamiliar class names, we increase the inter-class margin
for improved class discrimination using a novel Multimodal Margin Regularizer.
Extensive experiments and analysis across fifteen target benchmark datasets,
with varying degrees of distribution shifts from natural images, shows the
effectiveness of the proposed framework over the existing state-of-the-art
approaches applied to this setting. github.com/debarshigit/PromptMargin.

Conclusion: 视觉思维的研究为未来MCoT研究提供了新的突破方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in
multimodal tasks, with multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) further enhancing
performance and interpretability. Recent MCoT methods fall into two categories:
(i) Textual-MCoT (T-MCoT), which takes multimodal input and produces textual
output; and (ii) Interleaved-MCoT (I-MCoT), which generates interleaved
image-text outputs. Despite advances in both approaches, the mechanisms driving
these improvements are not fully understood. To fill this gap, we first reveal
that MCoT boosts LVLMs by incorporating visual thoughts, which convey image
information to the reasoning process regardless of the MCoT format, depending
only on clarity and conciseness of expression. Furthermore, to explore visual
thoughts systematically, we define four distinct forms of visual thought
expressions and analyze them comprehensively. Our findings demonstrate that
these forms differ in clarity and conciseness, yielding varying levels of MCoT
improvement. Additionally, we explore the internal nature of visual thoughts,
finding that visual thoughts serve as intermediaries between the input image
and reasoning to deeper transformer layers, enabling more advanced visual
information transmission. We hope that the visual thoughts can inspire further
breakthroughs for future MCoT research.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools across various
domains, yet tailoring pre-trained models to exhibit specific desirable
properties remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising solution,current methods struggle to simultaneously achieve stable,
efficient fine-tuning and support non-differentiable rewards. Furthermore,
their reliance on sparse rewards provides inadequate supervision during
intermediate steps, often resulting in suboptimal generation quality. To
address these limitations, dense and differentiable signals are required
throughout the diffusion process. Hence, we propose VAlue-based Reinforced
Diffusion (VARD): a novel approach that first learns a value function
predicting expection of rewards from intermediate states, and subsequently uses
this value function with KL regularization to provide dense supervision
throughout the generation process. Our method maintains proximity to the
pretrained model while enabling effective and stable training via
backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach facilitates
better trajectory guidance, improves training efficiency and extends the
applicability of RL to diffusion models optimized for complex,
non-differentiable reward functions.

Abstract: We introduce MMaDA, a novel class of multimodal diffusion foundation models
designed to achieve superior performance across diverse domains such as textual
reasoning, multimodal understanding, and text-to-image generation. The approach
is distinguished by three key innovations: (i) MMaDA adopts a unified diffusion
architecture with a shared probabilistic formulation and a modality-agnostic
design, eliminating the need for modality-specific components. This
architecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data
types. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning
strategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities. By aligning
reasoning processes between textual and visual domains, this strategy
facilitates cold-start training for the final reinforcement learning (RL)
stage, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex tasks from the
outset. (iii) We propose UniGRPO, a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm
specifically tailored for diffusion foundation models. Utilizing diversified
reward modeling, UniGRPO unifies post-training across both reasoning and
generation tasks, ensuring consistent performance improvements. Experimental
results demonstrate that MMaDA-8B exhibits strong generalization capabilities

attack detection (MAD), especially in real-world biometric applications. This
work introduces the use of LLMs for differential morphing attack detection
(D-MAD). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ
multimodal LLMs to D-MAD using real biometric data. To effectively utilize
these models, we design Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based prompts to reduce
failure-to-answer rates and enhance the reasoning behind decisions. Our
contributions include: (1) the first application of multimodal LLMs for D-MAD
using real data subjects, (2) CoT-based prompt engineering to improve response
reliability and explainability, (3) comprehensive qualitative and quantitative
benchmarking of LLM performance using data from 54 individuals captured in
passport enrollment scenarios, and (4) comparative analysis of two multimodal
LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and Gemini providing insights into their morphing attack
detection accuracy and decision transparency. Experimental results show that
ChatGPT-4o outperforms Gemini in detection accuracy, especially against
GAN-based morphs, though both models struggle under challenging conditions.
While Gemini offers more consistent explanations, ChatGPT-4o is more resilient
but prone to a higher failure-to-answer rate.

Motivation: 视频扩散变换器（DiTs）的计算成本高，尤其是注意力机制占用了80%以上的延迟，限制了其实际应用和扩展性。

Method: 采用下采样技术对压缩潜在空间中的特征图进行处理，生成低分辨率草稿注意力图，并通过重排序实现结构化稀疏注意力计算。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在视频生成质量上优于现有稀疏注意力方法，并在GPU上实现了最高1.75倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: DraftAttention通过动态稀疏注意力显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了生成质量，为视频扩散变换器的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion transformer-based video generation models (DiTs) have recently
attracted widespread attention for their excellent generation quality. However,
their computational cost remains a major bottleneck-attention alone accounts
for over 80% of total latency, and generating just 8 seconds of 720p video
takes tens of minutes-posing serious challenges to practical application and
scalability. To address this, we propose the DraftAttention, a training-free
framework for the acceleration of video diffusion transformers with dynamic
sparse attention on GPUs. We apply down-sampling to each feature map across
frames in the compressed latent space, enabling a higher-level receptive field
over the latent composed of hundreds of thousands of tokens. The low-resolution
draft attention map, derived from draft query and key, exposes redundancy both
spatially within each feature map and temporally across frames. We reorder the
query, key, and value based on the draft attention map to guide the sparse
attention computation in full resolution, and subsequently restore their
original order after the attention computation. This reordering enables
structured sparsity that aligns with hardware-optimized execution. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the low-resolution draft attention
closely approximates the full attention, providing reliable guidance for
constructing accurate sparse attention. Experimental results show that our
method outperforms existing sparse attention approaches in video generation
quality and achieves up to 1.75x end-to-end speedup on GPUs. Code:

TL;DR: FastCar框架通过利用时间冗余加速自回归视频生成的解码阶段，提出Temporal Attention Score（TAS）以减少冗余计算，并结合硬件加速器实现高效推理。


<details>

Motivation: 视频生成需要大量令牌，解码阶段延迟高，且相邻帧的MLP输出存在时间冗余。

Method: 提出TAS决定是否重用缓存的MLP输出以减少计算，并开发基于FPGA的硬件加速器。

Result: FastCar比传统稀疏注意力方法快2.1倍，能效更高，且结合稀疏注意力可提升高分辨率长视频生成性能。

Conclusion: FastCar通过时间冗余优化和硬件加速，显著提升视频生成效率。

Abstract: Auto-regressive (AR) models, initially successful in language generation,
have recently shown promise in visual generation tasks due to their superior
sampling efficiency. Unlike image generation, video generation requires a
substantially larger number of tokens to produce coherent temporal frames,
resulting in significant overhead during the decoding phase. Our key
observations are: (i) MLP modules in the decode phase dominate the inference
latency, and (ii) there exists high temporal redundancy in MLP outputs of
adjacent frames. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{FastCar} framework to
accelerate the decode phase for the AR video generation by exploring the
temporal redundancy. The Temporal Attention Score (TAS) is proposed to
determine whether to apply the replay strategy (\textit{i.e.}, reusing cached
MLP outputs from the previous frame to reduce redundant computations) with
detailed theoretical analysis and justification. Also, we develop a hardware
accelerator on FPGA with Dynamic Resource Scheduling (DRS) based on TAS to
enable better resource utilization and faster inference. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms traditional
sparse attention approaches with more than 2.1x decoding speedup and higher
energy efficiency on the edge. Furthermore, by combining FastCar and sparse
attention, FastCar can boost the performance of sparse attention with
alleviated drifting, demonstrating our unique advantages for high-resolution
and long-duration video generation. Code:

work investigates the extent to which prominent VLMs exhibit cultural biases by
evaluating their performance on an image-based country identification task at a

probe several large vision language models (VLMs) under various prompting

challenging setups like multilingual and adversarial settings. Our analysis
aims to uncover disparities in model accuracy across different countries and
question formats, providing insights into how training data distribution and
evaluation methodologies might influence cultural biases in VLMs. The findings
highlight significant variations in performance, suggesting that while VLMs
possess considerable visual understanding, they inherit biases from their
pre-training data and scale that impact their ability to generalize uniformly

video frame prediction by representing the dynamics of the video using a set of
neuro-symbolic, human-interpretable set of states (one per frame) by leveraging
the inductive biases of Large (Vision) Language Models (LLM/VLM). In
particular, ProgGen utilizes LLM/VLM to synthesize programs: (i) to estimate
the states of the video, given the visual context (i.e. the frames); (ii) to
predict the states corresponding to future time steps by estimating the
transition dynamics; (iii) to render the predicted states as visual RGB-frames.
Empirical evaluations reveal that our proposed method outperforms competing
techniques at the task of video frame prediction in two challenging

counter-factual reasoning and interpretable video generation attesting to its

Result: 在多种预训练模型上验证，ATM优于现有无需训练的方法，甚至超越大多数需要训练的方法，FLOPs减少30%且精度不降。

Conclusion: ATM为ViT提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的令牌压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become the standard architecture in
computer vision, their massive sizes lead to significant computational
overhead. Token compression techniques have attracted considerable attention to
address this issue, but they often suffer from severe information loss,
requiring extensive additional training to achieve practical performance. In
this paper, we propose Adaptive Token Merging (ATM), a novel method that
ensures lossless token merging, eliminating the need for fine-tuning while
maintaining competitive performance. ATM adaptively reduces tokens across
layers and batches by carefully adjusting layer-specific similarity thresholds,
thereby preventing the undesirable merging of less similar tokens with respect
to each layer. Furthermore, ATM introduces a novel token matching technique
that considers not only similarity but also merging sizes, particularly for the
final layers, to minimize the information loss incurred from each merging
operation. We empirically validate our method across a wide range of pretrained
models, demonstrating that ATM not only outperforms all existing training-free
methods but also surpasses most training-intensive approaches, even without
additional training. Remarkably, training-free ATM achieves over a 30%
reduction in FLOPs for the DeiT-T and DeiT-S models without any drop in their
original accuracy.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)
technologies, particularly in video generation, has led to unprecedented
creative capabilities but also increased threats to information integrity,
identity security, and public trust. Existing detection methods, while
effective in general scenarios, lack robust solutions for human-centric videos,
which pose greater risks due to their realism and potential for legal and
ethical misuse. Moreover, current detection approaches often suffer from poor
generalization, limited scalability, and reliance on labor-intensive supervised
fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, the first
interpretable MLLM-based framework for detecting human-centric fake videos,
enhanced via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through our carefully
designed accuracy detection reward and temporal compensation reward, it
effectively avoids the use of high-cost text annotation data, enabling precise
temporal modeling and forgery detection. Meanwhile, we design a dual-encoder
architecture, combining high-level semantic reasoning and low-level artifact
amplification to guide MLLMs in effective forgery detection. We further collect
FakeHumanVid, a large-scale human-centric video benchmark that includes
synthesis methods guided by pose, audio, and text inputs, enabling rigorous
evaluation of detection methods in real-world scenes. Extensive experiments
show that AvatarShield significantly outperforms existing approaches in both
in-domain and cross-domain detection, setting a new standard for human-centric

Result: 在GenImage数据集和最新生成模型上表现出卓越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: InfoFD通过多模态条件设计有效提升了AI生成图像检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Although existing CLIP-based methods for detecting AI-generated images have
achieved promising results, they are still limited by severe feature
redundancy, which hinders their generalization ability. To address this issue,
incorporating an information bottleneck network into the task presents a
straightforward solution. However, relying solely on image-corresponding
prompts results in suboptimal performance due to the inherent diversity of
prompts. In this paper, we propose a multimodal conditional bottleneck network
to reduce feature redundancy while enhancing the discriminative power of
features extracted by CLIP, thereby improving the model's generalization
ability. We begin with a semantic analysis experiment, where we observe that
arbitrary text features exhibit lower cosine similarity with real image
features than with fake image features in the CLIP feature space, a phenomenon
we refer to as "bias". Therefore, we introduce InfoFD, a text-guided
AI-generated image detection framework. InfoFD consists of two key components:
the Text-Guided Conditional Information Bottleneck (TGCIB) and Dynamic Text
Orthogonalization (DTO). TGCIB improves the generalizability of learned
representations by conditioning on both text and class modalities. DTO
dynamically updates weighted text features, preserving semantic information
while leveraging the global "bias". Our model achieves exceptional
generalization performance on the GenImage dataset and latest generative
models. Our code is available at https://github.com/Ant0ny44/InfoFD.

Conclusion: 生成式模型学习了一种内在的分组机制，能够跨类别和领域迁移，无需大规模预训练。

Abstract: By pretraining to synthesize coherent images from perturbed inputs,
generative models inherently learn to understand object boundaries and scene
compositions. How can we repurpose these generative representations for
general-purpose perceptual organization? We finetune Stable Diffusion and MAE
(encoder+decoder) for category-agnostic instance segmentation using our
instance coloring loss exclusively on a narrow set of object types (indoor
furnishings and cars). Surprisingly, our models exhibit strong zero-shot
generalization, accurately segmenting objects of types and styles unseen in
finetuning (and in many cases, MAE's ImageNet-1K pretraining too). Our
best-performing models closely approach the heavily supervised SAM when
evaluated on unseen object types and styles, and outperform it when segmenting
fine structures and ambiguous boundaries. In contrast, existing promptable
segmentation architectures or discriminatively pretrained models fail to
generalize. This suggests that generative models learn an inherent grouping
mechanism that transfers across categories and domains, even without
internet-scale pretraining. Code, pretrained models, and demos are available on
our website.

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success across diverse domains,
including remote sensing (RS), thanks to their versatility and strong
generalization abilities. However, most RS foundation models are designed for
multispectral data, while hyperspectral imagery (HSI) - with its hundreds of
spectral bands - remains less explored. Fine-tuning such models for downstream
tasks is also challenging, often demanding considerable memory and storage. In
this paper, we propose an efficient framework to fine-tune SpectralGPT, a
multispectral foundation model, for hyperspectral image classification (HSIC).
We explore several Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, including
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kronecker-based adaptation (KronA), Low-Rank
Kronecker (LoKr), and the recent LoRA+, which uses distinct learning rates for
low-rank adapters scaled by a factor lambda. Inspired by LoRA+, we introduce
KronA+, which applies a similar mechanism to the Kronecker matrices. We
evaluate our approach on five datasets from different sensors, showing
competitive performance with state-of-the-art HSI models. Our full fine-tuning
(FFT) setup for SpectralGPT even outperforms a dedicated hyperspectral
foundation model on some datasets while requiring only a quarter of the
training epochs. Under the same number of epochs, KronA+ reaches similar
performance with far fewer trainable parameters - just 0.056 percent - and adds
only approximately 0.2 megabytes of storage, making it the most effective PEFT
method tested.

Abstract: Expanding pre-trained zero-shot counting models to handle unseen categories

We introduce RichCount, the first framework to address these limitations,
employing a two-stage training strategy that enhances text encoding and
strengthens the model's association with objects in images. RichCount improves
zero-shot counting for unseen categories through two key objectives: (1)
enriching text features with a feed-forward network and adapter trained on
text-image similarity, thereby creating robust, aligned representations; and
(2) applying this refined encoder to counting tasks, enabling effective
generalization across diverse prompts and complex images. In this manner,
RichCount goes beyond simple prompt expansion to establish meaningful feature
alignment that supports accurate counting across novel categories. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
RichCount, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot counting and
significantly enhancing generalization to unseen categories in open-world

capability, we present a two-stage training pipeline, including supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we
construct the MM-CoF dataset, comprising 3K samples derived from a visual agent
designed to adaptively identify key regions to solve visual tasks with
different image resolutions and questions. We use MM-CoF to fine-tune the
Qwen2.5-VL model for cold start. In the RL stage, we leverage the outcome
accuracies and formats as rewards to update the Qwen2.5-VL model, enabling
further refining the search and reasoning strategy of models without human
priors. Our model achieves significant improvements on multiple benchmarks. On
the V* benchmark that requires strong visual reasoning capability, our model
outperforms existing VLMs by 5% among 8 image resolutions ranging from 224 to

Conclusion: Clapper显著提升长视频理解能力，同时保持短视频细节。

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse video understanding applications. Designing VLMs
for video inputs requires effectively modeling the temporal dimension (i.e.
capturing dependencies across frames) and balancing the processing of short and
long videos. Specifically, short videos demand preservation of fine-grained
details, whereas long videos require strategic compression of visual
information to handle extensive temporal contexts efficiently. However, our
empirical analysis reveals a critical limitation: most existing VLMs suffer
severe performance degradation in long video understanding tasks when
compressing visual tokens below a quarter of their original visual tokens. To
enable more effective modeling of both short and long video inputs, we propose
Clapper, a method that utilizes a slow-fast strategy for video representation
and introduces a novel module named TimePerceiver for efficient
temporal-spatial encoding within existing VLM backbones. By using our method,
we achieves 13x compression of visual tokens per frame (averaging 61
tokens/frame) without compromising QA accuracy. In our experiments, Clapper
achieves 62.0% on VideoMME, 69.8% on MLVU, and 67.4% on TempCompass, all with

this challenge, we introduce TinyDrive, a lightweight yet effective VLM for

cross-scale gating to generate enhanced visual representations. At the token
level, we design a token routing mechanism that dynamically selects and process
the most informative tokens based on learned importance scores. At the sequence
level, we propose integrating normalized loss, uncertainty estimates, and a
diversity metric to formulate sequence scores that rank and preserve samples
within a sequence priority buffer. Samples with higher scores are more
frequently selected for training. TinyDrive is first evaluated on our
custom-curated VQA dataset, and it is subsequently tested on the public DriveLM
benchmark, where it achieves state-of-the-art language understanding
performance. Notably, it achieves relative improvements of 11.1% and 35.4% in
BLEU-4 and METEOR scores, respectively, despite having a significantly smaller

Conclusion: AHNPL通过改进负样本生成和对比学习策略，有效提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are essential for multimodal tasks, especially
compositional reasoning (CR) tasks, which require distinguishing fine-grained
semantic differences between visual and textual embeddings. However, existing
methods primarily fine-tune the model by generating text-based hard negative
samples, neglecting the importance of image-based negative samples, which
results in insufficient training of the visual encoder and ultimately impacts
the overall performance of the model. Moreover, negative samples are typically
treated uniformly, without considering their difficulty levels, and the
alignment of positive samples is insufficient, which leads to challenges in
aligning difficult sample pairs. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Hard Negative Perturbation Learning (AHNPL). AHNPL translates text-based hard
negatives into the visual domain to generate semantically disturbed image-based
negatives for training the model, thereby enhancing its overall performance.
AHNPL also introduces a contrastive learning approach using a multimodal hard
negative loss to improve the model's discrimination of hard negatives within
each modality and a dynamic margin loss that adjusts the contrastive margin
according to sample difficulty to enhance the distinction of challenging sample
pairs. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method
effectively boosts VLMs' performance on complex CR tasks. The source code is

Abstract: Knowing the uncertainty associated with the output of a deep neural network
is of paramount importance in making trustworthy decisions, particularly in
high-stakes fields like medical diagnosis and autonomous systems. Monte Carlo
Dropout (MCD) is a widely used method for uncertainty quantification, as it can
be easily integrated into various deep architectures. However, conventional MCD
often struggles with providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. To
address this, we introduce innovative frameworks that enhances MCD by
integrating different search solutions namely Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO),
Bayesian Optimization (BO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as well as an
uncertainty-aware loss function, thereby improving the reliability of
uncertainty quantification. We conduct comprehensive experiments using
different backbones, namely DenseNet121, ResNet50, and VGG16, on various
datasets, including Cats vs. Dogs, Myocarditis, Wisconsin, and a synthetic
dataset (Circles). Our proposed algorithm outperforms the MCD baseline by 2-3%
on average in terms of both conventional accuracy and uncertainty accuracy
while achieving significantly better calibration. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to enhance the trustworthiness of deep learning
models in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Dataset Distillation (MDD) seeks to condense large-scale
image-text datasets into compact surrogates while retaining their effectiveness
for cross-modal learning. Despite recent progress, existing MDD approaches
often suffer from \textit{\textbf{Modality Collapse}}, characterized by
over-concentrated intra-modal representations and enlarged distributional gap
across modalities. In this paper, at the first time, we identify this issue as
stemming from a fundamental conflict between the over-compression behavior
inherent in dataset distillation and the cross-modal supervision imposed by
contrastive objectives. To alleviate modality collapse, we introduce
\textbf{RepBlend}, a novel MDD framework that weakens overdominant cross-modal
supervision via representation blending, thereby significantly enhancing
intra-modal diversity. Additionally, we observe that current MDD methods impose
asymmetric supervision across modalities, resulting in biased optimization. To
address this, we propose symmetric projection trajectory matching, which
synchronizes the optimization dynamics using modality-specific projection
heads, thereby promoting balanced supervision and enhancing cross-modal
alignment. Experiments on Flickr-30K and MS-COCO show that RepBlend
consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art MDD methods, achieving
significant gains in retrieval performance (e.g., +9.4 IR@10, +6.3 TR@10 under
the 100-pair setting) and offering up to 6.7$\times$ distillation speedup.

Abstract: Fake news detection remains a challenging problem due to the complex
interplay between textual misinformation, manipulated images, and external
knowledge reasoning. While existing approaches have achieved notable results in
verifying veracity and cross-modal consistency, two key challenges persist: (1)
Existing methods often consider only the global image context while neglecting
local object-level details, and (2) they fail to incorporate external knowledge
and entity relationships for deeper semantic understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal fake news detection framework that
integrates visual, textual, and knowledge-based representations. Our approach
leverages bottom-up attention to capture fine-grained object details, CLIP for
global image semantics, and RoBERTa for context-aware text encoding. We further
enhance knowledge utilization by retrieving and adaptively selecting relevant
entities from a knowledge graph. The fused multi-modal features are processed
through a Transformer-based classifier to predict news veracity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model outperforms recent approaches, showcasing
the effectiveness of neighbor selection mechanism and multi-modal fusion for
fake news detection. Our proposal introduces a new paradigm: knowledge-grounded
multimodal reasoning. By integrating explicit entity-level selection and
NLI-guided filtering, we shift fake news detection from feature fusion to
semantically grounded verification. For reproducibility and further research,

Abstract: The combination of Spiking Neural Networks(SNNs) with Vision Transformer
architectures has attracted significant attention due to the great potential
for energy-efficient and high-performance computing paradigms. However, a
substantial performance gap still exists between SNN-based and ANN-based
transformer architectures. While existing methods propose spiking
self-attention mechanisms that are successfully combined with SNNs, the overall

firstly uses multi-scale spiking attention (MSSA) to enrich the capability of
spiking attention blocks. We validate our approach across various main data

Abstract: Many practical medical imaging scenarios include categories that are
under-represented but still crucial. The relevance of image recognition models
to real-world applications lies in their ability to generalize to these rare
classes as well as unseen classes. Real-world generalization requires taking
into account the various complexities that can be encountered in the
real-world. First, training data is highly imbalanced, which may lead to model
exhibiting bias toward the more frequently represented classes. Moreover,
real-world data may contain unseen classes that need to be identified, and
model performance is affected by the data scarcity. While medical image
recognition has been extensively addressed in the literature, current methods
do not take into account all the intricacies in the real-world scenarios. To
this end, we propose an open-set learning method for highly imbalanced medical
datasets using a semi-supervised approach. Understanding the adverse impact of
long-tail distribution at the inherent model characteristics, we implement a
regularization strategy at the feature level complemented by a classifier
normalization technique. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly
available datasets, ISIC2018, ISIC2019, and TissueMNIST with various numbers of
labelled samples. Our analysis shows that addressing the impact of long-tail
data in classification significantly improves the overall performance of the
network in terms of closed-set and open-set accuracies on all datasets. Our

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving systems offer a promising alternative to
traditional modular pipelines by reducing information loss and error
accumulation, with significant potential to enhance both mobility and safety.
However, most existing E2E approaches directly generate plans based on dense
bird's-eye view (BEV) grid features, leading to inefficiency and limited
planning awareness. To address these limitations, we propose iterative
Proposal-centric autonomous driving (iPad), a novel framework that places
proposals - a set of candidate future plans - at the center of feature
extraction and auxiliary tasks. Central to iPad is ProFormer, a BEV encoder
that iteratively refines proposals and their associated features through
proposal-anchored attention, effectively fusing multi-view image data.
Additionally, we introduce two lightweight, proposal-centric auxiliary tasks -
mapping and prediction - that improve planning quality with minimal
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and CARLA
Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that iPad achieves state-of-the-art
performance while being significantly more efficient than prior leading
methods.

Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) is the capability to identify the specific regions in
an image associated with a particular text description. In medical imaging, VG
enhances interpretability by highlighting relevant pathological features
corresponding to textual descriptions, improving model transparency and
trustworthiness for wider adoption of deep learning models in clinical
practice. Current models struggle to associate textual descriptions with
disease regions due to inefficient attention mechanisms and a lack of
fine-grained token representations. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate
two key observations. First, current VLMs assign high norms to background
tokens, diverting the model's attention from regions of disease. Second, the
global tokens used for cross-modal learning are not representative of local
disease tokens. This hampers identifying correlations between the text and
disease tokens. To address this, we introduce simple, yet effective
Disease-Aware Prompting (DAP) process, which uses the explainability map of a
VLM to identify the appropriate image features. This simple strategy amplifies
disease-relevant regions while suppressing background interference. Without any
additional pixel-level annotations, DAP improves visual grounding accuracy by
20.74% compared to state-of-the-art methods across three major chest X-ray
datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation have emphasized the importance of
decoupling different knowledge components. While existing methods utilize
momentum mechanisms to separate task-oriented and distillation gradients, they
overlook the inherent conflict between target-class and non-target-class
knowledge flows. Furthermore, low-confidence dark knowledge in non-target
classes introduces noisy signals that hinder effective knowledge transfer. To
address these limitations, we propose DeepKD, a novel training framework that
integrates dual-level decoupling with adaptive denoising. First, through
theoretical analysis of gradient signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR) characteristics
in task-oriented and non-task-oriented knowledge distillation, we design
independent momentum updaters for each component to prevent mutual
interference. We observe that the optimal momentum coefficients for
task-oriented gradient (TOG), target-class gradient (TCG), and non-target-class
gradient (NCG) should be positively related to their GSNR. Second, we introduce
a dynamic top-k mask (DTM) mechanism that gradually increases K from a small
initial value to incorporate more non-target classes as training progresses,
following curriculum learning principles. The DTM jointly filters
low-confidence logits from both teacher and student models, effectively
purifying dark knowledge during early training. Extensive experiments on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO demonstrate DeepKD's effectiveness. Our code

adopt a compact RGB backbone and design a novel fusion module comprising a
Multi-Scale Feature Distillation (MSFD) block to enhance RGB features and a
three-stage fusion block with Cross-Modal Channel Shuffle Gate (CCSG) and
Cross-Modal Large Kernel Gate (CLKG) to facilitate effective cross-modal

Abstract: Cinematography is a cornerstone of film production and appreciation, shaping

gap, we present CineTechBench, a pioneering benchmark founded on precise,
manual annotation by seasoned cinematography experts across key cinematography
dimensions. Our benchmark covers seven essential aspects-shot scale, shot
angle, composition, camera movement, lighting, color, and focal length-and
includes over 600 annotated movie images and 120 movie clips with clear
cinematographic techniques. For the understanding task, we design question
answer pairs and annotated descriptions to assess MLLMs' ability to interpret
and explain cinematographic techniques. For the generation task, we assess
advanced video generation models on their capacity to reconstruct
cinema-quality camera movements given conditions such as textual prompts or
keyframes. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on 15+ MLLMs and 5+ video
generation models. Our results offer insights into the limitations of current
models and future directions for cinematography understanding and generation in

Abstract: Training text-to-image (T2I) models with detailed captions can significantly
improve their generation quality. Existing methods often rely on simplistic
metrics like caption length to represent the detailness of the caption in the
T2I training set. In this paper, we propose a new metric to estimate caption
detailness based on two aspects: image coverage rate (ICR), which evaluates
whether the caption covers all regions/objects in the image, and average object
detailness (AOD), which quantifies the detailness of each object's description.
Through experiments on the COCO dataset using ShareGPT4V captions, we
demonstrate that T2I models trained on high-ICR and -AOD captions achieve
superior performance on DPG and other benchmarks. Notably, our metric enables
more effective data selection-training on only 20% of full data surpasses both
full-dataset training and length-based selection method, improving alignment
and reconstruction ability. These findings highlight the critical role of
detail-aware metrics over length-based heuristics in caption selection for T2I
tasks.

systematically employs tangent space exploration and manifold-constrained

robustness to off-manifold deviations, and cross-domain alignment. Theoretical
analysis shows that GAMA tightens the generalization bound via structured
regularization and explicit alignment. Empirical results on DomainNet, VisDA,

Abstract: When humans speak, gestures help convey communicative intentions, such as
adding emphasis or describing concepts. However, current co-speech gesture
generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (\textit{e.g.}
speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the
communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs
that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Intentional-Gesture}, a novel framework
that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in
high-level communicative functions. % First, we curate the \textbf{InG} dataset
by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (\textit{i.e.}, text
sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using
large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the \textbf{Intentional
Gesture Motion Tokenizer} to leverage these intention annotations. It injects
high-level communicative functions (\textit{e.g.}, intentions) into tokenized
motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are
both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new
state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a
modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and
embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from
video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance
deployments. However, three fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption:
domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous
processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot
and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive
mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based
on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In
the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of
both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data.
In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched
against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at
inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU.
On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp),
respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.

Abstract: Recently, continuous representation methods emerge as novel paradigms that
characterize the intrinsic structures of real-world data through function
representations that map positional coordinates to their corresponding values
in the continuous space. As compared with the traditional discrete framework,
the continuous framework demonstrates inherent superiority for data
representation and reconstruction (e.g., image restoration, novel view
synthesis, and waveform inversion) by offering inherent advantages including
resolution flexibility, cross-modal adaptability, inherent smoothness, and
parameter efficiency. In this review, we systematically examine recent
advancements in continuous representation frameworks, focusing on three
aspects: (i) Continuous representation method designs such as basis function
representation, statistical modeling, tensor function decomposition, and
implicit neural representation; (ii) Theoretical foundations of continuous
representations such as approximation error analysis, convergence property, and
implicit regularization; (iii) Real-world applications of continuous
representations derived from computer vision, graphics, bioinformatics, and
remote sensing. Furthermore, we outline future directions and perspectives to
inspire exploration and deepen insights to facilitate continuous representation
methods, theories, and applications. All referenced works are summarized in our

Conclusion: 高质量小样本训练可优于大规模数据训练。

Abstract: 3D scene understanding plays a fundamental role in vision applications such
as robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. However, advancing
learning-based 3D scene understanding remains challenging due to two key
limitations: (1) the large scale and complexity of 3D scenes lead to higher
computational costs and slower training compared to 2D counterparts; and (2)
high-quality annotated 3D datasets are significantly scarcer than those
available for 2D vision. These challenges underscore the need for more
efficient learning paradigms. In this work, we propose DC-Scene, a data-centric
framework tailored for 3D scene understanding, which emphasizes enhancing data
quality and training efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a CLIP-driven
dual-indicator quality (DIQ) filter, combining vision-language alignment scores
with caption-loss perplexity, along with a curriculum scheduler that
progressively expands the training pool from the top 25% to 75% of
scene-caption pairs. This strategy filters out noisy samples and significantly
reduces dependence on large-scale labeled 3D data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D demonstrate that DC-Scene achieves state-of-the-art
performance (86.1 CIDEr with the top-75% subset vs. 85.4 with the full dataset)
while reducing training cost by approximately two-thirds, confirming that a
compact set of high-quality samples can outperform exhaustive training. Code

Conclusion: 和谐整合多模态互补信息对深度伪造检测至关重要。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of multimodal deepfakes (visual and auditory content are
manipulated in concert) undermines the reliability of existing detectors that
rely solely on modality-specific artifacts or cross-modal inconsistencies. In
this work, we first demonstrate that modality-specific forensic traces (e.g.,
face-swap artifacts or spectral distortions) and modality-shared semantic
misalignments (e.g., lip-speech asynchrony) offer complementary evidence, and
that neglecting either aspect limits detection performance. Existing approaches
either naively fuse modality-specific features without reconciling their
conflicting characteristics or focus predominantly on semantic misalignment at
the expense of modality-specific fine-grained artifact cues. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a general multimodal framework for video deepfake
detection via Cross-Modal Alignment and Distillation (CAD). CAD comprises two
core components: 1) Cross-modal alignment that identifies inconsistencies in
high-level semantic synchronization (e.g., lip-speech mismatches); 2)
Cross-modal distillation that mitigates feature conflicts during fusion while
preserving modality-specific forensic traces (e.g., spectral distortions in
synthetic audio). Extensive experiments on both multimodal and unimodal (e.g.,
image-only/video-only)deepfake benchmarks demonstrate that CAD significantly
outperforms previous methods, validating the necessity of harmonious
integration of multimodal complementary information.

Abstract: Despite progress in geometry-aware domain adaptation, current methods such as
GAMA still suffer from two unresolved issues: (1) insufficient disentanglement
of task-relevant and task-irrelevant manifold dimensions, and (2) rigid
perturbation schemes that ignore per-class alignment asymmetries. To address
this, we propose GAMA++, a novel framework that introduces (i) latent space
disentanglement to isolate label-consistent manifold directions from nuisance
factors, and (ii) an adaptive contrastive perturbation strategy that tailors
both on- and off-manifold exploration to class-specific manifold curvature and
alignment discrepancy. We further propose a cross-domain contrastive
consistency loss that encourages local semantic clusters to align while
preserving intra-domain diversity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results
on DomainNet, Office-Home, and VisDA benchmarks under both standard and
few-shot settings, with notable improvements in class-level alignment fidelity
and boundary robustness. GAMA++ sets a new standard for semantic geometry
alignment in transfer learning.

Conclusion: 结合对比学习的数据集蒸馏方法在极端样本稀缺情况下优于现有技术。

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models in resource-constrained environments, such
as edge devices or rapid prototyping scenarios, increasingly demands
distillation of large datasets into significantly smaller yet informative
synthetic datasets. Current dataset distillation techniques, particularly
Trajectory Matching methods, optimize synthetic data so that the model's
training trajectory on synthetic samples mirrors that on real data. While
demonstrating efficacy on medium-scale synthetic datasets, these methods fail
to adequately preserve semantic richness under extreme sample scarcity. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel dataset distillation method
integrating contrastive learning during image synthesis. By explicitly
maximizing instance-level feature discrimination, our approach produces more
informative and diverse synthetic samples, even when dataset sizes are
significantly constrained. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating
contrastive learning substantially enhances the performance of models trained
on very small-scale synthetic datasets. This integration not only guides more
effective feature representation but also significantly improves the visual
fidelity of the synthesized images. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves notable performance improvements over existing distillation
techniques, especially in scenarios with extremely limited synthetic data.

Abstract: Face recognition models have made substantial progress due to advances in
deep learning and the availability of large-scale datasets. However, reliance
on massive annotated datasets introduces challenges related to training
computational cost and data storage, as well as potential privacy concerns
regarding managing large face datasets. This paper presents DiffProb, the first
data pruning approach for the application of face recognition. DiffProb
assesses the prediction probabilities of training samples within each identity
and prunes the ones with identical or close prediction probability values, as
they are likely reinforcing the same decision boundaries, and thus contribute
minimally with new information. We further enhance this process with an
auxiliary cleaning mechanism to eliminate mislabeled and label-flipped samples,
boosting data quality with minimal loss. Extensive experiments on CASIA-WebFace
with different pruning ratios and multiple benchmarks, including LFW, CFP-FP,
and IJB-C, demonstrate that DiffProb can prune up to 50% of the dataset while
maintaining or even, in some settings, improving the verification accuracies.
Additionally, we demonstrate DiffProb's robustness across different
architectures and loss functions. Our method significantly reduces training
cost and data volume, enabling efficient face recognition training and reducing
the reliance on massive datasets and their demanding management.

Abstract: We propose R3GS, a robust reconstruction and relocalization framework
tailored for unconstrained datasets. Our method uses a hybrid representation
during training. Each anchor combines a global feature from a convolutional
neural network (CNN) with a local feature encoded by the multiresolution hash
grids [2]. Subsequently, several shallow multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) predict
the attributes of each Gaussians, including color, opacity, and covariance. To
mitigate the adverse effects of transient objects on the reconstruction
process, we ffne-tune a lightweight human detection network. Once ffne-tuned,
this network generates a visibility map that efffciently generalizes to other
transient objects (such as posters, banners, and cars) with minimal need for
further adaptation. Additionally, to address the challenges posed by sky
regions in outdoor scenes, we propose an effective sky-handling technique that
incorporates a depth prior as a constraint. This allows the inffnitely distant
sky to be represented on the surface of a large-radius sky sphere,
signiffcantly reducing ffoaters caused by errors in sky reconstruction.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel relocalization method that remains robust to
changes in lighting conditions while estimating the camera pose of a given
image within the reconstructed 3DGS scene. As a result, R3GS significantly
enhances rendering ffdelity, improves both training and rendering efffciency,
and reduces storage requirements. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to baseline methods on in-the-wild datasets. The code will
be made open-source following the acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Mapping and understanding complex 3D environments is fundamental to how
autonomous systems perceive and interact with the physical world, requiring
both precise geometric reconstruction and rich semantic comprehension. While
existing 3D semantic mapping systems excel at reconstructing and identifying
predefined object instances, they lack the flexibility to efficiently build
semantic maps with open-vocabulary during online operation. Although recent
vision-language models have enabled open-vocabulary object recognition in 2D
images, they haven't yet bridged the gap to 3D spatial understanding. The
critical challenge lies in developing a training-free unified system that can
simultaneously construct accurate 3D maps while maintaining semantic
consistency and supporting natural language interactions in real time. In this
paper, we develop a zero-shot framework that seamlessly integrates
GPU-accelerated geometric reconstruction with open-vocabulary vision-language
models through online instance-level semantic embedding fusion, guided by
hierarchical object association with spatial indexing. Our training-free system
achieves superior performance through incremental processing and unified
geometric-semantic updates, while robustly handling 2D segmentation
inconsistencies. The proposed general-purpose 3D scene understanding framework
can be used for various tasks including zero-shot 3D instance retrieval,

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MVLMs) have achieved par excellence
generalization in medical image analysis, yet their performance under noisy,
corrupted conditions remains largely untested. Clinical imaging is inherently
susceptible to acquisition artifacts and noise; however, existing evaluations
predominantly assess generally clean datasets, overlooking robustness -- i.e.,
the model's ability to perform under real-world distortions. To address this
gap, we first introduce MediMeta-C, a corruption benchmark that systematically
applies several perturbations across multiple medical imaging datasets.
Combined with MedMNIST-C, this establishes a comprehensive robustness
evaluation framework for MVLMs. We further propose RobustMedCLIP, a visual
encoder adaptation of a pretrained MVLM that incorporates few-shot tuning to
enhance resilience against corruptions. Through extensive experiments, we
benchmark 5 major MVLMs across 5 medical imaging modalities, revealing that
existing models exhibit severe degradation under corruption and struggle with
domain-modality tradeoffs. Our findings highlight the necessity of diverse
training and robust adaptation strategies, demonstrating that efficient
low-rank adaptation when paired with few-shot tuning, improves robustness while
preserving generalization across modalities.

Abstract: Reasoning about temporal causality, particularly irreversible transformations
of objects governed by real-world knowledge (e.g., fruit decay and human
aging), is a fundamental aspect of human visual understanding. Unlike temporal
perception based on simple event sequences, this form of reasoning requires a
deeper comprehension of how object states change over time. Although the
current powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, their capacity to reason about
temporal causality remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
\textbf{TimeCausality}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the
causal reasoning ability of VLMs in the temporal dimension. Based on our
TimeCausality, we find that while the current SOTA open-source VLMs have
achieved performance levels comparable to closed-source models like GPT-4o on
various standard visual question answering tasks, they fall significantly
behind on our benchmark compared with their closed-source competitors.
Furthermore, even GPT-4o exhibits a marked drop in performance on TimeCausality
compared to its results on other tasks. These findings underscore the critical
need to incorporate temporal causality into the evaluation and development of
VLMs, and they highlight an important challenge for the open-source VLM
community moving forward. Code and Data are available at

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效且高效，为SLT任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to map sign language videos to spoken
language text. A common approach relies on gloss annotations as an intermediate
representation, decomposing SLT into two sub-tasks: video-to-gloss recognition
and gloss-to-text translation. While effective, this paradigm depends on
expert-annotated gloss labels, which are costly and rarely available in
existing datasets, limiting its scalability. To address this challenge, we
propose a gloss-free pseudo gloss generation framework that eliminates the need
for human-annotated glosses while preserving the structured intermediate
representation. Specifically, we prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) with a few
example text-gloss pairs using in-context learning to produce draft sign
glosses from spoken language text. To enhance the correspondence between
LLM-generated pseudo glosses and the sign sequences in video, we correct the
ordering in the pseudo glosses for better alignment via a weakly supervised
learning process. This reordering facilitates the incorporation of auxiliary
alignment objectives, and allows for the use of efficient supervision via a
Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. We train our SLT mode, which
consists of a vision encoder and a translator, through a three-stage pipeline,
which progressively narrows the modality gap between sign language and spoken
language. Despite its simplicity, our approach outperforms previous
state-of-the-art gloss-free frameworks on two SLT benchmarks and achieves
competitive results compared to gloss-based methods.

Conclusion: FRN通过逐步预测和状态空间模型设计，实现了高效的光谱重建，为低成本HSI生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generating hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB images through spectral
reconstruction can significantly reduce the cost of HSI acquisition. In this
paper, we propose a Fractal-Based Recursive Spectral Reconstruction Network
(FRN), which differs from existing paradigms that attempt to directly integrate
the full-spectrum information from the R, G, and B channels in a one-shot
manner. Instead, it treats spectral reconstruction as a progressive process,
predicting from broad to narrow bands or employing a coarse-to-fine approach
for predicting the next wavelength. Inspired by fractals in mathematics, FRN
establishes a novel spectral reconstruction paradigm by recursively invoking an
atomic reconstruction module. In each invocation, only the spectral information
from neighboring bands is used to provide clues for the generation of the image
at the next wavelength, which follows the low-rank property of spectral data.
Moreover, we design a band-aware state space model that employs a
pixel-differentiated scanning strategy at different stages of the generation
process, further suppressing interference from low-correlation regions caused
by reflectance differences. Through extensive experimentation across different
datasets, FRN achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Method: 提出一个框架，通过建模创作者意图（期望影响和执行计划）生成多模态新闻内容，并构建包含12,000个图像-标题对的数据集DeceptionDecoded。

Result: 评估显示，当前视觉语言模型在识别误导意图时表现不足，常依赖虚假线索（如表面跨模态一致性）。

Conclusion: 研究强调了意图感知建模的重要性，并为开发能深入推理多模态虚假信息的系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The real-world impact of misinformation stems from the underlying misleading
narratives that creators seek to convey. As such, interpreting misleading
creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD)
systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce
an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by
explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired
influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct
DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs
aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both
misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and
textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks:
(1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3)
creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs
fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues
such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic
authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware
modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of
deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种Squeeze-and-Recalibrate (SR)块，作为MIL模型中线性层的替代，以减少参数数量并防止过拟合，同时保持性能。

Motivation: 解决计算病理学中专家标注稀缺和少样本学习中的过拟合问题，同时避免现有方法的复杂预处理和高计算成本。

Method: SR块包含低秩可训练矩阵（压缩路径）和冻结的随机重校准矩阵，以减少参数并保持几何结构。

Result: SR-MIL模型在实验中表现优于现有方法，且参数更少，无需架构修改。

Conclusion: SR块是一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于少样本MIL任务。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced computational pathology but expert annotations
remain scarce. Few-shot learning mitigates annotation burdens yet suffers from
overfitting and discriminative feature mischaracterization. In addition, the
current few-shot multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches leverage
pretrained vision-language models to alleviate these issues, but at the cost of
complex preprocessing and high computational cost. We propose a
Squeeze-and-Recalibrate (SR) block, a drop-in replacement for linear layers in
MIL models to address these challenges. The SR block comprises two core
components: a pair of low-rank trainable matrices (squeeze pathway, SP) that
reduces parameter count and imposes a bottleneck to prevent spurious feature
learning, and a frozen random recalibration matrix that preserves geometric
structure, diversifies feature directions, and redefines the optimization
objective for the SP. We provide theoretical guarantees that the SR block can
approximate any linear mapping to arbitrary precision, thereby ensuring that
the performance of a standard MIL model serves as a lower bound for its
SR-enhanced counterpart. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SR-MIL
models consistently outperform prior methods while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and no architectural changes.

Conclusion: UWSAM通过高效设计和自动提示生成，解决了水下实例分割的挑战。

Abstract: With recent breakthroughs in large-scale modeling, the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in a variety of visual
applications. However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and
its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance
segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further
hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we
propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which
includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we
introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate
segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from
the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the
Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective
visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater
Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater
prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts,
thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for
efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model
is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets. Datasets and
codes are available at https://github.com/LiamLian0727/UIIS10K.

Abstract: Large-scale pretrained vision backbones have transformed computer vision by
providing powerful feature extractors that enable various downstream tasks,
including training-free approaches like visual prompting for semantic
segmentation. Despite their success in generic scenarios, these models often
fall short when applied to specialized technical domains where the visual
features differ significantly from their training distribution. To bridge this
gap, we introduce VP Lab, a comprehensive iterative framework that enhances
visual prompting for robust segmentation model development. At the core of VP
Lab lies E-PEFT, a novel ensemble of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques
specifically designed to adapt our visual prompting pipeline to specific
domains in a manner that is both parameter- and data-efficient. Our approach
not only surpasses the state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient fine-tuning for
the Segment Anything Model (SAM), but also facilitates an interactive,
near-real-time loop, allowing users to observe progressively improving results
as they experiment within the framework. By integrating E-PEFT with visual
prompting, we demonstrate a remarkable 50\% increase in semantic segmentation
mIoU performance across various technical datasets using only 5 validated
images, establishing a new paradigm for fast, efficient, and interactive model
deployment in new, challenging domains. This work comes in the form of a
demonstration.

Abstract: Generalization of deep-learning-based (DL) computer vision algorithms to
various image perturbations is hard to establish and remains an active area of
research. The majority of past analyses focused on the images already captured,
whereas effects of the image formation pipeline and environment are less
studied. In this paper, we address this issue by analyzing the impact of
capture conditions, such as camera parameters and lighting, on DL model
performance on 3 vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and
visual question answering (VQA). To this end, we assess capture bias in common
vision datasets and create a new benchmark, SNAP (for $\textbf{S}$hutter speed,
ISO se$\textbf{N}$sitivity, and $\textbf{AP}$erture), consisting of images of
objects taken under controlled lighting conditions and with densely sampled
camera settings. We then evaluate a large number of DL vision models and show
the effects of capture conditions on each selected vision task. Lastly, we
conduct an experiment to establish a human baseline for the VQA task. Our
results show that computer vision datasets are significantly biased, the models
trained on this data do not reach human accuracy even on the well-exposed
images, and are susceptible to both major exposure changes and minute
variations of camera settings. Code and data can be found at

Abstract: Fine-grained edited image detection of localized edits in images is crucial
for assessing content authenticity, especially given that modern diffusion
models and image editing methods can produce highly realistic manipulations.
However, this domain faces three challenges: (1) Binary classifiers yield only
a global real-or-fake label without providing localization; (2) Traditional
computer vision methods often rely on costly pixel-level annotations; and (3)
No large-scale, high-quality dataset exists for modern image-editing detection
techniques. To address these gaps, we develop an automated data-generation
pipeline to create FragFake, the first dedicated benchmark dataset for edited
image detection, which includes high-quality images from diverse editing models
and a wide variety of edited objects. Based on FragFake, we utilize Vision
Language Models (VLMs) for the first time in the task of edited image
classification and edited region localization. Experimental results show that
fine-tuned VLMs achieve higher average Object Precision across all datasets,
significantly outperforming pretrained models. We further conduct ablation and
transferability analyses to evaluate the detectors across various
configurations and editing scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work
is the first to reformulate localized image edit detection as a vision-language
understanding task, establishing a new paradigm for the field. We anticipate
that this work will establish a solid foundation to facilitate and inspire
subsequent research endeavors in the domain of multimodal content authenticity.

Abstract: Multimodal pathological image understanding has garnered widespread interest
due to its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and enable personalized
treatment through integrated visual and textual data. However, existing methods
exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, which hamper their ability to handle
complex diagnostic scenarios. Additionally, the enormous size of pathological
images leads to severe computational burdens, further restricting their
practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
bilateral reinforcement learning framework comprising two synergistic branches.
One reinforcement branch enhances the reasoning capability by enabling the
model to learn task-specific decision processes, i.e., pathology rationales,
directly from labels without explicit reasoning supervision. While the other
branch dynamically allocates a tailored number of tokens to different images
based on both their visual content and task context, thereby optimizing
computational efficiency. We apply our method to various pathological tasks
such as visual question answering, cancer subtyping, and lesion detection.
Extensive experiments show an average +41.7 absolute performance improvement
with 70.3% lower inference costs over the base models, achieving both reasoning
accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Motion forecasting represents a critical challenge in autonomous driving
systems, requiring accurate prediction of surrounding agents' future
trajectories. While existing approaches predict future motion states with the
extracted scene context feature from historical agent trajectories and road
layouts, they suffer from the information degradation during the scene feature
encoding. To address the limitation, we propose HAMF, a novel motion
forecasting framework that learns future motion representations with the scene
context encoding jointly, to coherently combine the scene understanding and
future motion state prediction. We first embed the observed agent states and
map information into 1D token sequences, together with the target multi-modal
future motion features as a set of learnable tokens. Then we design a unified
Attention-based encoder, which synergistically combines self-attention and
cross-attention mechanisms to model the scene context information and aggregate
future motion features jointly. Complementing the encoder, we implement the
Mamba module in the decoding stage to further preserve the consistency and
correlations among the learned future motion representations, to generate the
accurate and diverse final trajectories. Extensive experiments on Argoverse 2
benchmark demonstrate that our hybrid Attention-Mamba model achieves
state-of-the-art motion forecasting performance with the simple and lightweight
architecture.

Abstract: The intrication of brain signals drives research that leverages multimodal AI
to align brain modalities with visual and textual data for explainable
descriptions. However, most existing studies are limited to coarse
interpretations, lacking essential details on object descriptions, locations,
attributes, and their relationships. This leads to imprecise and ambiguous
reconstructions when using such cues for visual decoding. To address this, we
analyze different choices of vision feature spaces from pre-trained visual
components within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and introduce a
zero-shot multimodal brain decoding method that interacts with these models to
decode across multiple levels of granularities. % To assess a model's ability
to decode fine details from brain signals, we propose the Multi-Granularity
Brain Detail Understanding Benchmark (MG-BrainDub). This benchmark includes two
key tasks: detailed descriptions and salient question-answering, with metrics
highlighting key visual elements like objects, attributes, and relationships.
Our approach enhances neural decoding precision and supports more accurate
neuro-decoding applications. Code will be available at

Conclusion: IA-T2I框架有效提升了T2I模型在知识不确定场景下的生成能力。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models achieve promising results, but
they fail on the scenarios where the knowledge implied in the text prompt is
uncertain. For example, a T2I model released in February would struggle to
generate a suitable poster for a movie premiering in April, because the
character designs and styles are uncertain to the model. To solve this problem,
we propose an Internet-Augmented text-to-image generation (IA-T2I) framework to
compel T2I models clear about such uncertain knowledge by providing them with
reference images. Specifically, an active retrieval module is designed to
determine whether a reference image is needed based on the given text prompt; a
hierarchical image selection module is introduced to find the most suitable
image returned by an image search engine to enhance the T2I model; a
self-reflection mechanism is presented to continuously evaluate and refine the
generated image to ensure faithful alignment with the text prompt. To evaluate
the proposed framework's performance, we collect a dataset named Img-Ref-T2I,
where text prompts include three types of uncertain knowledge: (1) known but
rare. (2) unknown. (3) ambiguous. Moreover, we carefully craft a complex prompt
to guide GPT-4o in making preference evaluation, which has been shown to have
an evaluation accuracy similar to that of human preference evaluation.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
outperforming GPT-4o by about 30% in human evaluation.

state-of-the-art performance for 4D human video synthesis, demonstrating

Abstract: Language-Guided object recognition in remote sensing imagery is crucial for
large-scale mapping and automated data annotation. However, existing
open-vocabulary and visual grounding methods rely on explicit category cues,
limiting their ability to handle complex or implicit queries that require
advanced reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce a new suite of tasks,
including Instruction-Oriented Object Counting, Detection, and Segmentation
(InstructCDS), covering open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass
scenarios. We further present EarthInstruct, the first InstructCDS benchmark
for earth observation. It is constructed from two diverse remote sensing
datasets with varying spatial resolutions and annotation rules across 20
categories, necessitating models to interpret dataset-specific instructions.
Given the scarcity of semantically rich labeled data in remote sensing, we
propose InstructSAM, a training-free framework for instruction-driven object
recognition. InstructSAM leverages large vision-language models to interpret
user instructions and estimate object counts, employs SAM2 for mask proposal,
and formulates mask-label assignment as a binary integer programming problem.
By integrating semantic similarity with counting constraints, InstructSAM
efficiently assigns categories to predicted masks without relying on confidence
thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that InstructSAM matches or surpasses
specialized baselines across multiple tasks while maintaining near-constant
inference time regardless of object count, reducing output tokens by 89% and
overall runtime by over 32% compared to direct generation approaches. We
believe the contributions of the proposed tasks, benchmark, and effective
approach will advance future research in developing versatile object
recognition systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds strong potential for medical diagnostics,

generalizability. This study introduces the Pathobiological Dictionary for
Liver Cancer (LCP1.0), a practical framework designed to translate complex
Pathomics and Radiomics Features (PF and RF) into clinically meaningful
insights aligned with existing diagnostic workflows. QuPath and PyRadiomics,
standardized according to IBSI guidelines, were used to extract 333 imaging
features from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue samples, including 240
PF-based-cell detection/intensity, 74 RF-based texture, and 19 RF-based
first-order features. Expert-defined ROIs from the public dataset excluded
artifact-prone areas, and features were aggregated at the case level. Their
relevance to the WHO grading system was assessed using multiple classifiers
linked with feature selectors. The resulting dictionary was validated by 8
experts in oncology and pathology. In collaboration with 10 domain experts, we
developed a Pathobiological dictionary of imaging features such as PFs and RF.
In our study, the Variable Threshold feature selection algorithm combined with
the SVM model achieved the highest accuracy (0.80, P-value less than 0.05),
selecting 20 key features, primarily clinical and pathomics traits such as
Centroid, Cell Nucleus, and Cytoplasmic characteristics. These features,
particularly nuclear and cytoplasmic, were strongly associated with tumor
grading and prognosis, reflecting atypia indicators like pleomorphism,
hyperchromasia, and cellular orientation.The LCP1.0 provides a clinically
validated bridge between AI outputs and expert interpretation, enhancing model
transparency and usability. Aligning AI-derived features with clinical
semantics supports the development of interpretable, trustworthy diagnostic

Abstract: Lung cancer remains among the deadliest types of cancer in recent decades,
and early lung nodule detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The
limited availability of annotated medical imaging data remains a bottleneck in
developing accurate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Self-supervised
learning can help leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to develop more
robust CAD systems. With the recent advent of transformer-based architecture
and their ability to generalize to unseen tasks, there has been an effort
within the healthcare community to adapt them to various medical downstream
tasks. Thus, we propose a novel "LungNodule-SSM" method, which utilizes
selfsupervised learning with DINOv2 as a backbone to enhance lung nodule
detection and classification without annotated data. Our methodology has two
stages: firstly, the DINOv2 model is pre-trained on unlabeled CT scans to learn
robust feature representations, then secondly, these features are fine-tuned
using transformer-based architectures for lesionlevel detection and accurate
lung nodule diagnosis. The proposed method has been evaluated on the
challenging LUNA 16 dataset, consisting of 888 CT scans, and compared with SOTA
methods. Our experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method
with an accuracy of 98.37%, explaining its effectiveness in lung nodule

Abstract: Frequently, multiple entities (methods, algorithms, procedures, solutions,
etc.) can be developed for a common task and applied across various domains
that differ in the distribution of scenarios encountered. For example, in
computer vision, the input data provided to image analysis methods depend on
the type of sensor used, its location, and the scene content. However, a
crucial difficulty remains: can we predict which entities will perform best in
a new domain based on assessments on known domains, without having to carry out
new and costly evaluations? This paper presents an original methodology to
address this question, in a leave-one-domain-out fashion, for various
application-specific preferences. We illustrate its use with 30 strategies to
predict the rankings of 40 entities (unsupervised background subtraction
methods) on 53 domains (videos).

Conclusion: AGNOSTOS和X-ICM为通用机器人操作研究提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of vision-language-action (VLA) models to
unseen tasks are crucial to achieving general-purpose robotic manipulation in
open-world settings. However, the cross-task generalization capabilities of
existing VLA models remain significantly underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce AGNOSTOS, a novel simulation benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate cross-task zero-shot generalization in manipulation. AGNOSTOS
comprises 23 unseen manipulation tasks for testing, distinct from common
training task distributions, and incorporates two levels of generalization
difficulty to assess robustness. Our systematic evaluation reveals that current
VLA models, despite being trained on diverse datasets, struggle to generalize
effectively to these unseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Cross-Task In-Context Manipulation (X-ICM), a method that conditions large
language models (LLMs) on in-context demonstrations from seen tasks to predict
action sequences for unseen tasks. Additionally, we introduce a dynamics-guided
sample selection strategy that identifies relevant demonstrations by capturing
cross-task dynamics. On AGNOSTOS, X-ICM significantly improves cross-task
zero-shot generalization performance over leading VLAs. We believe AGNOSTOS and
X-ICM will serve as valuable tools for advancing general-purpose robotic
manipulation.

Abstract: The automatic analysis of document layouts in digital-born PDF documents
remains a challenging problem due to the heterogeneous arrangement of textual
and nontextual elements and the imprecision of the textual metadata in the
Portable Document Format. In this work, we benchmark Graph Neural Network (GNN)
architectures for the task of fine-grained layout classification of text blocks
from digital native documents. We introduce two graph construction structures:
a k-closest-neighbor graph and a fully connected graph, and generate node
features via pre-trained text and vision models, thus avoiding manual feature
engineering. Three experimental frameworks are evaluated: single-modality (text
or visual), concatenated multimodal, and dual-branch multimodal. We evaluated
four foundational GNN models and compared them with the baseline. Our
experiments are specifically conducted on a rich dataset of public affairs
documents that includes more than 20 sources (e.g., regional and national-level
official gazettes), 37K PDF documents, with 441K pages in total. Our results
demonstrate that GraphSAGE operating on the k-closest-neighbor graph in a
dual-branch configuration achieves the highest per-class and overall accuracy,
outperforming the baseline in some sources. These findings confirm the
importance of local layout relationships and multimodal fusion exploited
through GNNs for the analysis of native digital document layouts.

Conclusion: CrypticBio旨在推动生物多样性AI模型的发展，解决物种模糊性的挑战。

Abstract: We present CrypticBio, the largest publicly available multimodal dataset of
visually confusing species, specifically curated to support the development of
AI models in the context of biodiversity applications. Visually confusing or
cryptic species are groups of two or more taxa that are nearly
indistinguishable based on visual characteristics alone. While much existing
work addresses taxonomic identification in a broad sense, datasets that
directly address the morphological confusion of cryptic species are small,
manually curated, and target only a single taxon. Thus, the challenge of
identifying such subtle differences in a wide range of taxa remains
unaddressed. Curated from real-world trends in species misidentification among
community annotators of iNaturalist, CrypticBio contains 52K unique cryptic
groups spanning 67K species, represented in 166 million images. Rich
research-grade image annotations--including scientific, multicultural, and
multilingual species terminology, hierarchical taxonomy, spatiotemporal
context, and associated cryptic groups--address multimodal AI in biodiversity
research. For easy dataset curation, we provide an open-source pipeline
CrypticBio-Curate. The multimodal nature of the dataset beyond vision-language
arises from the integration of geographical and temporal data as complementary
cues to identifying cryptic species. To highlight the importance of the
dataset, we benchmark a suite of state-of-the-art foundation models across
CrypticBio subsets of common, unseen, endangered, and invasive species, and
demonstrate the substantial impact of geographical context on vision-language
zero-shot learning for cryptic species. By introducing CrypticBio, we aim to
catalyze progress toward real-world-ready biodiversity AI models capable of
handling the nuanced challenges of species ambiguity.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation stands as a pivotal research focus in computer vision.
In the context of industrial image inspection, conventional semantic
segmentation models fail to maintain the segmentation consistency of fixed
components across varying contextual environments due to a lack of perception
of object contours. Given the real-time constraints and limited computing
capability of industrial image detection machines, it is also necessary to
create efficient models to reduce computational complexity. In this work, a
Shape-Aware Efficient Network (SPENet) is proposed, which focuses on the shapes
of objects to achieve excellent segmentation consistency by separately
supervising the extraction of boundary and body information from images. In
SPENet, a novel method is introduced for describing fuzzy boundaries to better
adapt to real-world scenarios named Variable Boundary Domain (VBD).
Additionally, a new metric, Consistency Mean Square Error(CMSE), is proposed to
measure segmentation consistency for fixed components. Our approach attains the
best segmentation accuracy and competitive speed on our dataset, showcasing
significant advantages in CMSE among numerous state-of-the-art real-time
segmentation networks, achieving a reduction of over 50% compared to the
previously top-performing models.

significant changes in the generated face image. Based on the correspondence,
we indirectly confirm the dependence of human identity on external factors in

key human attributes-namely skin tone, hair color, iris color, and vein-based
undertones. The system employs a multi-stage pipeline involving face detection,
region segmentation, and dominant color extraction to isolate and analyze these
features. Techniques such as X-means clustering, alongside perceptually uniform
distance metrics like Delta E (CIEDE2000), are applied within both LAB and HSV
color spaces to enhance the accuracy of color differentiation. For
classification, the dominant tones of the skin, hair, and iris are extracted
and matched to a custom tone scale, while vein analysis from wrist images
enables undertone classification into "Warm" or "Cool" based on LAB
differences. Each module uses targeted segmentation and color space
transformations to ensure perceptual precision. The system achieves up to 80%
accuracy in tone classification using the Delta E-HSV method with Gaussian
blur, demonstrating reliable performance across varied lighting and image
conditions. This work highlights the potential of AI-powered color analysis and
feature extraction for delivering inclusive, precise, and nuanced

Abstract: Multi-modal data in Earth Observation (EO) presents a huge opportunity for
improving transfer learning capabilities when pre-training deep learning
models. Unlike prior work that often overlooks multi-modal EO data, recent
methods have started to include it, resulting in more effective pre-training
strategies. However, existing approaches commonly face challenges in
effectively transferring learning to downstream tasks where the structure of
available data differs from that used during pre-training. This paper addresses
this limitation by exploring a more flexible multi-modal, multi-task
pre-training strategy for EO data. Specifically, we adopt a Multi-modal
Multi-task Masked Autoencoder (MultiMAE) that we pre-train by reconstructing
diverse input modalities, including spectral, elevation, and segmentation data.
The pre-trained model demonstrates robust transfer learning capabilities,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods on various EO datasets for
classification and segmentation tasks. Our approach exhibits significant
flexibility, handling diverse input configurations without requiring
modality-specific pre-trained models. Code will be available at:

Abstract: Gaining insights into the structural and functional mechanisms of the brain
has been a longstanding focus in neuroscience research, particularly in the
context of understanding and treating neuropsychiatric disorders such as
Schizophrenia (SZ). Nevertheless, most of the traditional multimodal deep
learning approaches fail to fully leverage the complementary characteristics of
structural and functional connectomics data to enhance diagnostic performance.
To address this issue, we proposed ConneX, a multimodal fusion method that
integrates cross-attention mechanism and multilayer perceptron (MLP)-Mixer for
refined feature fusion. Modality-specific backbone graph neural networks (GNNs)
were firstly employed to obtain feature representation for each modality. A
unified cross-modal attention network was then introduced to fuse these
embeddings by capturing intra- and inter-modal interactions, while MLP-Mixer
layers refined global and local features, leveraging higher-order dependencies
for end-to-end classification with a multi-head joint loss. Extensive
evaluations demonstrated improved performance on two distinct clinical
datasets, highlighting the robustness of our proposed framework.

Abstract: Remote sensing images (RSIs) capture both natural and human-induced changes
on the Earth's surface, serving as essential data for environmental monitoring,
urban planning, and resource management. Semantic segmentation (SS) of RSIs
enables the fine-grained interpretation of surface features, making it a
critical task in remote sensing analysis. With the increasing diversity and
volume of RSIs collected by sensors on various platforms, traditional
processing methods struggle to maintain efficiency and accuracy. In response,
deep learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative approach, enabling
substantial advances in remote sensing image semantic segmentation (RSISS) by
automating feature extraction and improving segmentation accuracy across
diverse modalities. This paper revisits the evolution of DL-based RSISS by
categorizing existing approaches into four stages: the early pixel-based
methods, the prevailing patch-based and tile-based techniques, and the emerging
image-based strategies enabled by foundation models. We analyze these
developments from the perspective of feature extraction and learning
strategies, revealing the field's progression from pixel-level to tile-level
and from unimodal to multimodal segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of nearly 40 advanced techniques on a unified dataset
to quantitatively characterize their performance and applicability. This review
offers a holistic view of DL-based SS for RS, highlighting key advancements,
comparative insights, and open challenges to guide future research.

Abstract: Generalized gait recognition, which aims to achieve robust performance across
diverse domains, remains a challenging problem due to severe domain shifts in
viewpoints, appearances, and environments. While mixed-dataset training is
widely used to enhance generalization, it introduces new obstacles including
inter-dataset optimization conflicts and redundant or noisy samples, both of
which hinder effective representation learning. To address these challenges, we
propose a unified framework that systematically improves cross-domain gait
recognition. First, we design a disentangled triplet loss that isolates
supervision signals across datasets, mitigating gradient conflicts during
optimization. Second, we introduce a targeted dataset distillation strategy
that filters out the least informative 20\% of training samples based on
feature redundancy and prediction uncertainty, enhancing data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on CASIA-B, OU-MVLP, Gait3D, and GREW demonstrate that
our method significantly improves cross-dataset recognition for both GaitBase
and DeepGaitV2 backbones, without sacrificing source-domain accuracy. Code will
be released at https://github.com/li1er3/Generalized_Gait.

Abstract: Recent advances in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated
promising results in real-time high-fidelity rendering without per-scene
optimization, yet existing approaches still struggle to handle unfamiliar
visual content during inference on novel scenes due to limited
generalizability. To address this challenge, we introduce MonoSplat, a novel
framework that leverages rich visual priors from pre-trained monocular depth
foundation models for robust Gaussian reconstruction. Our approach consists of
two key components: a Mono-Multi Feature Adapter that transforms monocular
features into multi-view representations, coupled with an Integrated Gaussian
Prediction module that effectively fuses both feature types for precise
Gaussian generation. Through the Adapter's lightweight attention mechanism,
features are seamlessly aligned and aggregated across views while preserving
valuable monocular priors, enabling the Prediction module to generate Gaussian
primitives with accurate geometry and appearance. Through extensive experiments
on diverse real-world datasets, we convincingly demonstrate that MonoSplat
achieves superior reconstruction quality and generalization capability compared
to existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency with minimal
trainable parameters. Codes are available at

Abstract: Transferring 2D textures to 3D modalities is of great significance for
improving the efficiency of multimedia content creation. Existing approaches
have rarely focused on transferring image textures onto 3D representations. 3D
style transfer methods are capable of transferring abstract artistic styles to
3D scenes. However, these methods often overlook the geometric information of
the scene, which makes it challenging to achieve high-quality 3D texture
transfer results. In this paper, we present GT^2-GS, a geometry-aware texture
transfer framework for gaussian splitting. From the perspective of matching
texture features with geometric information in rendered views, we identify the
issue of insufficient texture features and propose a geometry-aware texture
augmentation module to expand the texture feature set. Moreover, a
geometry-consistent texture loss is proposed to optimize texture features into
the scene representation. This loss function incorporates both camera pose and
3D geometric information of the scene, enabling controllable texture-oriented
appearance editing. Finally, a geometry preservation strategy is introduced. By
alternating between the texture transfer and geometry correction stages over
multiple iterations, this strategy achieves a balance between learning texture
features and preserving geometric integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness and controllability of our method. Through geometric
awareness, our approach achieves texture transfer results that better align
with human visual perception. Our homepage is available at

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training deep

While current approaches typically rely on synthetic augmentations of single
images, we propose VET-DINO, a framework that leverages a unique characteristic
of medical imaging: the availability of multiple standardized views from the
same study. Using a series of clinical veterinary radiographs from the same
patient study, we enable models to learn view-invariant anatomical structures
and develop an implied 3D understanding from 2D projections. We demonstrate our
approach on a dataset of 5 million veterinary radiographs from 668,000 canine
studies. Through extensive experimentation, including view synthesis and
downstream task performance, we show that learning from real multi-view pairs
leads to superior anatomical understanding compared to purely synthetic
augmentations. VET-DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on various
veterinary imaging tasks. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
self-supervised learning in medical imaging that leverages domain-specific
properties rather than merely adapting natural image techniques.

segmentation, marking the application of eye-tracking for 3D medical image
segmentation. We evaluate the performance of using gaze-based prompts with
SAM-2 and MedSAM-2 using both synthetic and real gaze data. Compared to
bounding boxes, gaze-based prompts offer a time-efficient interaction approach
with slightly lower segmentation quality. Our findings highlight the potential

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件数据集通常从密集RGB视频合成，缺乏视角多样性和几何一致性，或依赖昂贵硬件。GS2E旨在克服这些限制。

Method: 通过3D高斯泼溅重建静态场景，结合物理模拟的事件生成管道，包括自适应轨迹插值和事件对比阈值建模。

Result: 实验表明GS2E在事件3D重建中具有优越的泛化能力，可作为事件视觉研究的基准。

Conclusion: GS2E为事件视觉研究提供了高质量、多样化的合成数据集。

Abstract: We introduce GS2E (Gaussian Splatting to Event), a large-scale synthetic
event dataset for high-fidelity event vision tasks, captured from real-world
sparse multi-view RGB images. Existing event datasets are often synthesized
from dense RGB videos, which typically lack viewpoint diversity and geometric
consistency, or depend on expensive, difficult-to-scale hardware setups. GS2E
overcomes these limitations by first reconstructing photorealistic static
scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting, and subsequently employing a novel,
physically-informed event simulation pipeline. This pipeline generally
integrates adaptive trajectory interpolation with physically-consistent event
contrast threshold modeling. Such an approach yields temporally dense and
geometrically consistent event streams under diverse motion and lighting
conditions, while ensuring strong alignment with underlying scene structures.
Experimental results on event-based 3D reconstruction demonstrate GS2E's
superior generalization capabilities and its practical value as a benchmark for
advancing event vision research.

Result: 在姿势、表情和情感的精确控制上优于现有方法，同时提高了生成多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法在身份条件生成中实现了更高的控制精度和多样性。

Abstract: Human facial images encode a rich spectrum of information, encompassing both
stable identity-related traits and mutable attributes such as pose, expression,
and emotion. While recent advances in image generation have enabled
high-quality identity-conditional face synthesis, precise control over
non-identity attributes remains challenging, and disentangling identity from
these mutable factors is particularly difficult. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel identity-conditional diffusion model that introduces two
lightweight control modules designed to independently manipulate facial pose,
expression, and emotion without compromising identity preservation. These
modules are embedded within the cross-attention layers of the base diffusion
model, enabling precise attribute control with minimal parameter overhead.
Furthermore, our tailored training strategy, which leverages cross-attention
between the identity feature and each non-identity control feature, encourages
identity features to remain orthogonal to control signals, enhancing
controllability and diversity. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along
with perceptual user studies, demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of control accuracy over pose, expression, and emotion,
while also improving generative diversity under identity-only conditioning.

Abstract: The proliferation of diffusion-based deepfake technologies poses significant
risks for unauthorized and unethical facial image manipulation. While
traditional countermeasures have primarily focused on passive detection
methods, this paper introduces a novel proactive defense strategy through
adversarial attacks that preemptively protect facial images from being
exploited by diffusion-based deepfake systems. Existing adversarial protection
methods predominantly target conventional generative architectures (GANs, AEs,
VAEs) and fail to address the unique challenges presented by diffusion models,
which have become the predominant framework for high-quality facial deepfakes.
Current diffusion-specific adversarial approaches are limited by their reliance
on specific model architectures and weights, rendering them ineffective against
the diverse landscape of diffusion-based deepfake implementations.
Additionally, they typically employ global perturbation strategies that
inadequately address the region-specific nature of facial manipulation in
deepfakes.

Abstract: With recent advancements in neural rendering and motion capture algorithms,
remarkable progress has been made in photorealistic human avatar modeling,
unlocking immense potential for applications in virtual reality, augmented
reality, remote communication, and industries such as gaming, film, and
medicine. However, existing methods fail to provide complete, faithful, and
expressive control over human avatars due to their entangled representation of
facial expressions and body movements. In this work, we introduce Expressive
Virtual Avatars (EVA), an actor-specific, fully controllable, and expressive
human avatar framework that achieves high-fidelity, lifelike renderings in real
time while enabling independent control of facial expressions, body movements,
and hand gestures. Specifically, our approach designs the human avatar as a
two-layer model: an expressive template geometry layer and a 3D Gaussian
appearance layer. First, we present an expressive template tracking algorithm
that leverages coarse-to-fine optimization to accurately recover body motions,
facial expressions, and non-rigid deformation parameters from multi-view
videos. Next, we propose a novel decoupled 3D Gaussian appearance model
designed to effectively disentangle body and facial appearance. Unlike unified
Gaussian estimation approaches, our method employs two specialized and
independent modules to model the body and face separately. Experimental results
demonstrate that EVA surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of rendering
quality and expressiveness, validating its effectiveness in creating full-body
avatars. This work represents a significant advancement towards fully drivable
digital human models, enabling the creation of lifelike digital avatars that
faithfully replicate human geometry and appearance.

Abstract: The extraction of visual features is an essential step in Visual Question
Answering (VQA). Building a good visual representation of the analyzed scene is
indeed one of the essential keys for the system to be able to correctly
understand the latter in order to answer complex questions. In many fields such
as remote sensing, the visual feature extraction step could benefit
significantly from leveraging different image modalities carrying complementary
spectral, spatial and contextual information. In this work, we propose to add
multiple image modalities to VQA in the particular context of remote sensing,
leading to a novel task for the computer vision community. To this end, we
introduce a new VQA dataset, named TAMMI (Text and Multi-Modal Imagery) with
diverse questions on scenes described by three different modalities (very high
resolution RGB, multi-spectral imaging data and synthetic aperture radar).
Thanks to an automated pipeline, this dataset can be easily extended according
to experimental needs. We also propose the MM-RSVQA (Multi-modal
Multi-resolution Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering) model, based on
VisualBERT, a vision-language transformer, to effectively combine the multiple
image modalities and text through a trainable fusion process. A preliminary
experimental study shows promising results of our methodology on this
challenging dataset, with an accuracy of 65.56% on the targeted VQA task. This
pioneering work paves the way for the community to a new multi-modal
multi-resolution VQA task that can be applied in other imaging domains (such as
medical imaging) where multi-modality can enrich the visual representation of a
scene. The dataset and code are available at https://tammi.sylvainlobry.com/.

Abstract: Face recognition is an effective technology for identifying a target person

Although privacy-preserving face recognition is one of potential solutions,
this solution neither fully addresses the privacy concerns nor is efficient
enough. To this end, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving solution for
face recognition, named Pura, which sufficiently protects facial privacy and
supports face recognition over encrypted data efficiently. Specifically, we
propose a privacy-preserving and non-interactive architecture for face
recognition through the threshold Paillier cryptosystem. Additionally, we
carefully design a suite of underlying secure computing protocols to enable
efficient operations of face recognition over encrypted data directly.
Furthermore, we introduce a parallel computing mechanism to enhance the
performance of the proposed secure computing protocols. Privacy analysis
demonstrates that Pura fully safeguards personal facial privacy. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that Pura achieves recognition speeds up to 16 times
faster than the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: SGFNet通过光谱视角有效解决了RGB与热辐射数据的特征融合问题，提升了语义分割的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relying solely on RGB data often struggles in
challenging conditions such as low illumination and obscured views, limiting
its reliability in critical applications like autonomous driving. To address
this, integrating additional thermal radiation data with RGB images
demonstrates enhanced performance and robustness. However, how to effectively
reconcile the modality discrepancies and fuse the RGB and thermal features
remains a well-known challenge. In this work, we address this challenge from a
novel spectral perspective. We observe that the multi-modal features can be
categorized into two spectral components: low-frequency features that provide
broad scene context, including color variations and smooth areas, and
high-frequency features that capture modality-specific details such as edges
and textures. Inspired by this, we propose the Spectral-aware Global Fusion
Network (SGFNet) to effectively enhance and fuse the multi-modal features by
explicitly modeling the interactions between the high-frequency,
modality-specific features. Our experimental results demonstrate that SGFNet
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the MFNet and PST900 datasets.

underwater target detection network. To address the problems of low detection
accuracy caused by low contrast, mutual occlusion and dense distribution of
underwater targets in underwater object detection, a detection model suitable
for underwater target detection is proposed by introducing deformable
convolution and dilated convolution. The proposed detection model can obtain
more effective information by increasing the receptive field. In addition, the
regression loss function EIoU is introduced, which improves model performance
by separately calculating the width and height losses of the predicted box.
Experiment results show that the accuracy of the underwater target detection

Abstract: Recent years have seen substantial improvements in the ability to generate
synthetic 3D objects using AI. However, generating complex 3D objects, such as
plants, remains a considerable challenge. Current generative 3D models struggle
with plant generation compared to general objects, limiting their usability in
plant analysis tools, which require fine detail and accurate geometry. We
introduce PlantDreamer, a novel approach to 3D synthetic plant generation,
which can achieve greater levels of realism for complex plant geometry and
textures than available text-to-3D models. To achieve this, our new generation
pipeline leverages a depth ControlNet, fine-tuned Low-Rank Adaptation and an
adaptable Gaussian culling algorithm, which directly improve textural realism
and geometric integrity of generated 3D plant models. Additionally,
PlantDreamer enables both purely synthetic plant generation, by leveraging
L-System-generated meshes, and the enhancement of real-world plant point clouds
by converting them into 3D Gaussian Splats. We evaluate our approach by
comparing its outputs with state-of-the-art text-to-3D models, demonstrating
that PlantDreamer outperforms existing methods in producing high-fidelity
synthetic plants. Our results indicate that our approach not only advances
synthetic plant generation, but also facilitates the upgrading of legacy point
cloud datasets, making it a valuable tool for 3D phenotyping applications.

Abstract: 3D semantic segmentation plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving and road
infrastructure analysis, yet state-of-the-art 3D models are prone to severe
domain shift when deployed across different datasets. We propose a novel
multi-view projection framework that excels in both domain generalization (DG)

into coherent 3D scenes and renders them from multiple virtual camera poses to
create a large-scale synthetic 2D dataset (PC2D). We then use it to train a 2D
segmentation model in-domain. During inference, the model processes hundreds of
views per scene; the resulting logits are back-projected to 3D with an
occlusion-aware voting scheme to generate final point-wise labels. Our
framework is modular and enables extensive exploration of key design
parameters, such as view generation optimization (VGO), visualization modality
optimization (MODO), and 2D model choice. We evaluate on the nuScenes and
SemanticKITTI datasets under both the DG and UDA settings. We achieve
state-of-the-art results in UDA and close to state-of-the-art in DG, with
particularly large gains on large, static classes. Our code and dataset

Abstract: Scene text detection has seen the emergence of high-performing methods that
excel on academic benchmarks. However, these detectors often fail to replicate
such success in real-world scenarios. We uncover two key factors contributing
to this discrepancy through extensive experiments. First, a \textit{Fine-tuning
Gap}, where models leverage \textit{Dataset-Specific Optimization} (DSO)
paradigm for one domain at the cost of reduced effectiveness in others, leads
to inflated performances on academic benchmarks. Second, the suboptimal
performance in practical settings is primarily attributed to the long-tailed
distribution of texts, where detectors struggle with rare and complex
categories as artistic or overlapped text. Given that the DSO paradigm might
undermine the generalization ability of models, we advocate for a
\textit{Joint-Dataset Learning} (JDL) protocol to alleviate the Fine-tuning
Gap. Additionally, an error analysis is conducted to identify three major
categories and 13 subcategories of challenges in long-tailed scene text, upon
which we propose a Long-Tailed Benchmark (LTB). LTB facilitates a comprehensive
evaluation of ability to handle a diverse range of long-tailed challenges. We

baseline for LTB. The code is available at https://github.com/pd162/LTB.

Abstract: Acquiring detailed 3D scenes typically demands costly equipment, multi-view
data, or labor-intensive modeling. Therefore, a lightweight alternative,
generating complex 3D scenes from a single top-down image, plays an essential
role in real-world applications. While recent 3D generative models have
achieved remarkable results at the object level, their extension to full-scene
generation often leads to inconsistent geometry, layout hallucinations, and
low-quality meshes. In this work, we introduce 3DTown, a training-free
framework designed to synthesize realistic and coherent 3D scenes from a single
top-down view. Our method is grounded in two principles: region-based
generation to improve image-to-3D alignment and resolution, and spatial-aware
3D inpainting to ensure global scene coherence and high-quality geometry
generation. Specifically, we decompose the input image into overlapping regions
and generate each using a pretrained 3D object generator, followed by a masked
rectified flow inpainting process that fills in missing geometry while
maintaining structural continuity. This modular design allows us to overcome
resolution bottlenecks and preserve spatial structure without requiring 3D
supervision or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across diverse scenes show
that 3DTown outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including Trellis,
Hunyuan3D-2, and TripoSG, in terms of geometry quality, spatial coherence, and
texture fidelity. Our results demonstrate that high-quality 3D town generation
is achievable from a single image using a principled, training-free approach.

Abstract: Exemplar-based image colorization aims to colorize a grayscale image using a
reference color image, ensuring that reference colors are applied to
corresponding input regions based on their semantic similarity. To achieve
accurate semantic matching between regions, we leverage the self-attention
module of a pre-trained diffusion model, which is trained on a large dataset
and exhibits powerful attention capabilities. To harness this power, we propose
a novel, fine-tuning-free approach based on a pre-trained diffusion model,
making two key contributions. First, we introduce dual attention-guided color
transfer. We utilize the self-attention module to compute an attention map
between the input and reference images, effectively capturing semantic
correspondences. The color features from the reference image is then
transferred to the semantically matching regions of the input image, guided by
this attention map, and finally, the grayscale features are replaced with the
corresponding color features. Notably, we utilize dual attention to calculate
attention maps separately for the grayscale and color images, achieving more
precise semantic alignment. Second, we propose classifier-free colorization

Conclusion: 该方法对采样模式、解剖变化和MRI扫描协议具有鲁棒性，只要每个运动状态采样了低频成分。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly susceptible to motion artifacts
due to the extended acquisition times required for k-space sampling. These
artifacts can compromise diagnostic utility, particularly for dynamic imaging.
We propose a novel alternating minimization framework that leverages a bespoke
diffusion model to jointly reconstruct and correct non-rigid motion-corrupted
k-space data. The diffusion model uses a coarse-to-fine denoising strategy to
capture large overall motion and reconstruct the lower frequencies of the image
first, providing a better inductive bias for motion estimation than that of
standard diffusion models. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on
both real-world cine cardiac MRI datasets and complex simulated rigid and
non-rigid deformations, even when each motion state is undersampled by a factor
of 64x. Additionally, our method is agnostic to sampling patterns, anatomical
variations, and MRI scanning protocols, as long as some low frequency
components are sampled during each motion state.

Abstract: Computed Tomography serves as an indispensable tool in clinical workflows,

In this paper, we present X-GRM (X-ray Gaussian Reconstruction Model), a large

an arbitrary number of sparse X-ray inputs, where tokens from different views

representation, named Voxel-based Gaussian Splatting (VoxGS), which enables
efficient CT volume extraction and differentiable X-ray rendering. To support
the training of X-GRM, we collect ReconX-15K, a large-scale CT reconstruction

including the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and tooth etc. This combination of a

Conclusion: BadSR有效提升了后门攻击的隐蔽性和攻击效果。

Abstract: With the widespread application of super-resolution (SR) in various fields,
researchers have begun to investigate its security. Previous studies have
demonstrated that SR models can also be subjected to backdoor attacks through
data poisoning, affecting downstream tasks. A backdoor SR model generates an
attacker-predefined target image when given a triggered image while producing a
normal high-resolution (HR) output for clean images. However, prior backdoor
attacks on SR models have primarily focused on the stealthiness of poisoned
low-resolution (LR) images while ignoring the stealthiness of poisoned HR
images, making it easy for users to detect anomalous data. To address this
problem, we propose BadSR, which improves the stealthiness of poisoned HR
images. The key idea of BadSR is to approximate the clean HR image and the
pre-defined target image in the feature space while ensuring that modifications
to the clean HR image remain within a constrained range. The poisoned HR images
generated by BadSR can be integrated with existing triggers. To further improve
the effectiveness of BadSR, we design an adversarially optimized trigger and a
backdoor gradient-driven poisoned sample selection method based on a genetic
algorithm. The experimental results show that BadSR achieves a high attack
success rate in various models and data sets, significantly affecting
downstream tasks.

Abstract: Cervical cancer, the fourth leading cause of cancer in women globally,

isolate the cancer cells. A novel Deep Learning (DL) architecture, the
``Multi-Resolution Fusion Deep Convolutional Network", was proposed to
effectively handle images with varying resolutions and aspect ratios, with its
efficacy showcased using the SIPaKMeD dataset. The performance of this DL model
was observed to be similar to the state-of-the-art models, with accuracy
variations of a mere 2\% to 3\%, achieved using just 1.7 million learnable

Furthermore, we introduced a multi-task learning technique that simultaneously
performs segmentation and classification tasks and begets an Intersection over
Union score of 0.83 and a classification accuracy of 90\%. The final stage of
the workflow employs a probabilistic approach for risk assessment, extracting
feature vectors to predict the likelihood of normal cells progressing to

Abstract: Urban forests play a key role in enhancing environmental quality and
supporting biodiversity in cities. Mapping and monitoring these green spaces
are crucial for urban planning and conservation, yet accurately detecting trees
is challenging due to complex landscapes and the variability in image
resolution caused by different satellite sensors or UAV flight altitudes. While
deep learning architectures have shown promise in addressing these challenges,
their effectiveness remains strongly dependent on the availability of large and
manually labeled datasets, which are often expensive and difficult to obtain in
sufficient quantity. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates
domain adaptation with GANs and Diffusion models to enhance the quality of
low-resolution aerial images. Our proposed pipeline enhances low-resolution
imagery while preserving semantic content, enabling effective tree segmentation
without requiring large volumes of manually annotated data. Leveraging models
such as pix2pix, Real-ESRGAN, Latent Diffusion, and Stable Diffusion, we
generate realistic and structurally consistent synthetic samples that expand
the training dataset and unify scale across domains. This approach not only
improves the robustness of segmentation models across different acquisition
conditions but also provides a scalable and replicable solution for remote
sensing scenarios with scarce annotation resources. Experimental results
demonstrated an improvement of over 50% in IoU for low-resolution images,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method compared to traditional pipelines.

Abstract: Omni-domain infrared small target detection (IRSTD) poses formidable
challenges, as a single model must seamlessly adapt to diverse imaging systems,
varying resolutions, and multiple spectral bands simultaneously. Current
approaches predominantly rely on visual-only modeling paradigms that not only
struggle with complex background interference and inherently scarce target
features, but also exhibit limited generalization capabilities across complex
omni-scene environments where significant domain shifts and appearance
variations occur. In this work, we reveal a critical oversight in existing
paradigms: the neglect of readily available auxiliary metadata describing
imaging parameters and acquisition conditions, such as spectral bands, sensor
platforms, resolution, and observation perspectives. To address this
limitation, we propose the Auxiliary Metadata Driven Infrared Small Target
Detector (AuxDet), a novel multi-modal framework that fundamentally reimagines
the IRSTD paradigm by incorporating textual metadata for scene-aware
optimization. Through a high-dimensional fusion module based on multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), AuxDet dynamically integrates metadata semantics with
visual features, guiding adaptive representation learning for each individual
sample. Additionally, we design a lightweight prior-initialized enhancement
module using 1D convolutional blocks to further refine fused features and
recover fine-grained target cues. Extensive experiments on the challenging
WideIRSTD-Full benchmark demonstrate that AuxDet consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, validating the critical role of auxiliary information
in improving robustness and accuracy in omni-domain IRSTD tasks. Code is

Abstract: Change detection, a critical task in remote sensing and computer vision, aims
to identify pixel-level differences between image pairs captured at the same
geographic area but different times. It faces numerous challenges such as
illumination variation, seasonal changes, background interference, and shooting
angles, especially with a large time gap between images. While current methods
have advanced, they often overlook temporal dependencies and overemphasize
prominent changes while ignoring subtle but equally important changes. To
address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{CEBSNet}, a novel
change-excited and background-suppressed network with temporal dependency
modeling for change detection. During the feature extraction, we utilize a
simple Channel Swap Module (CSM) to model temporal dependency, reducing
differences and noise. The Feature Excitation and Suppression Module (FESM) is
developed to capture both obvious and subtle changes, maintaining the integrity
of change regions. Additionally, we design a Pyramid-Aware Spatial-Channel
Attention module (PASCA) to enhance the ability to detect change regions at
different sizes and focus on critical regions. We conduct extensive experiments
on three common street view datasets and two remote sensing datasets, and our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 通过文献综述，将SfM方法分为三类，并分析其理论条件和问题表述。

Result: 提出了新的SfM分类视角，明确了理论条件对问题解的影响，并指出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文为SfM研究提供了系统性分类和理论框架，有助于推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) refers to the problem of recovering both
structure (i.e., 3D coordinates of points in the scene) and motion (i.e.,
camera matrices) starting from point correspondences in multiple images. It has
attracted significant attention over the years, counting practical
reconstruction pipelines as well as theoretical results. This paper is
conceived as a conceptual review of SfM methods, which are grouped into three
main categories, according to which part of the problem - between motion and
structure - they focus on. The proposed taxonomy brings a new perspective on
existing SfM approaches as well as insights into open problems and possible
future research directions. Particular emphasis is given on identifying the
theoretical conditions that make SfM well posed, which depend on the problem
formulation that is being considered.

Conclusion: 研究为ComBAT的优化提供了实用建议，支持可重复性和临床部署。

Abstract: Over the years, ComBAT has become the standard method for harmonizing
MRI-derived measurements, with its ability to compensate for site-related
additive and multiplicative biases while preserving biological variability.
However, ComBAT relies on a set of assumptions that, when violated, can result
in flawed harmonization. In this paper, we thoroughly review ComBAT's
mathematical foundation, outlining these assumptions, and exploring their
implications for the demographic composition necessary for optimal results.
  Through a series of experiments involving a slightly modified version of
ComBAT called Pairwise-ComBAT tailored for normative modeling applications, we
assess the impact of various population characteristics, including population
size, age distribution, the absence of certain covariates, and the magnitude of
additive and multiplicative factors. Based on these experiments, we present
five essential recommendations that should be carefully considered to enhance
consistency and supporting reproducibility, two essential factors for open
science, collaborative research, and real-life clinical deployment.

Abstract: Malocclusion is a major challenge in orthodontics, and its complex
presentation and diverse clinical manifestations make accurate localization and
diagnosis particularly important. Currently, one of the major shortcomings
facing the field of dental image analysis is the lack of large-scale,
accurately labeled datasets dedicated to malocclusion issues, which limits the
development of automated diagnostics in the field of dentistry and leads to a
lack of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical practice. Therefore, in
this study, we propose the Oral and Maxillofacial Natural Images (OMNI)
dataset, a novel and comprehensive dental image dataset aimed at advancing the
study of analyzing dental images for issues of malocclusion. Specifically, the
dataset contains 4166 multi-view images with 384 participants in data
collection and annotated by professional dentists. In addition, we performed a
comprehensive validation of the created OMNI dataset, including three CNN-based
methods, two Transformer-based methods, and one GNN-based method, and conducted
automated diagnostic experiments for malocclusion issues. The experimental
results show that the OMNI dataset can facilitate the automated diagnosis
research of malocclusion issues and provide a new benchmark for the research in
this field. Our OMNI dataset and baseline code are publicly available at

Conclusion: 结合免疫组化数据可提高模型可解释性和预测性能，并可能加速新型生物标志物的发现。

Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype defined by the
lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, resulting in limited targeted
treatment options. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is the standard treatment
for early-stage TNBC, with pathologic complete response (pCR) serving as a key
prognostic marker; however, only 40-50% of patients with TNBC achieve pCR.
Accurate prediction of NACT response is crucial to optimize therapy, avoid
ineffective treatments, and improve patient outcomes. In this study, we
developed a deep learning model to predict NACT response using pre-treatment
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained biopsy images. Our model achieved promising
results in five-fold cross-validation (accuracy: 82%, AUC: 0.86, F1-score:
0.84, sensitivity: 0.85, specificity: 0.81, precision: 0.80). Analysis of model
attention maps in conjunction with multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) data
revealed that regions of high predictive importance consistently colocalized
with tumor areas showing elevated PD-L1 expression, CD8+ T-cell infiltration,
and CD163+ macrophage density - all established biomarkers of treatment
response. Our findings indicate that incorporating IHC-derived immune profiling
data could substantially improve model interpretability and predictive
performance. Furthermore, this approach may accelerate the discovery of novel
histopathological biomarkers for NACT and advance the development of
personalized treatment strategies for TNBC patients.

Conclusion: SEC是一种高效的RL微调策略，能自动优化训练课程，提升LLMs的推理能力和泛化性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large
language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in
domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing
RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training
problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they
remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on
heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To
address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an
automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy
concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates
curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating
each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual
arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy
measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum
policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using
the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive
reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly
improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to
harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves
better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning
domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL
fine-tuning of LLMs.

Conclusion: 当前对齐方法脆弱，需考虑更强威胁模型以确保LLM安全。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in real-world applications
ranging from chatbots to agentic systems. Alignment is one of the main
approaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and
jailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even
against Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates
adversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search
space over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding
successful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to
local minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we
assess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed
threat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment
process. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the
intermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting
as a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly
effective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show
our informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show
a gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack
performance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to
successfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective
across diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs,
effective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses,
that these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit
alignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together,
our results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and
the need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs.

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于更透明和有针对性地研究现代模型的算法能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capabilities such as coding and solving mathematical problems to
commonsense inference. While these tasks vary in complexity, they all require
models to integrate and compute over structured information. Despite recent
efforts to reverse-engineer LLM behavior through controlled experiments, our
understanding of how these models internalize and execute complex algorithms
remains limited. Progress has largely been confined to small-scale studies or
shallow tasks such as basic arithmetic and grammatical pattern matching. One
barrier to deeper understanding is the nature of pretraining data -- vast,
heterogeneous, and often poorly annotated, making it difficult to isolate
mechanisms of reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale, fully
open, complexity-annotated dataset of first-order logic reasoning traces,
designed to probe and analyze algorithmic reasoning in LLMs. The dataset
consists of 3.5 billion tokens, including 8.8 million LLM-augmented,
human-annotated examples and 7.5 million synthetically generated examples. Each
synthetic example is verifiably correct, produced by a custom automated theorem
solver, and accompanied by metadata tracing its algorithmic provenance. We aim
to provide a scalable, interpretable artifact for studying how LLMs learn and
generalize symbolic reasoning processes, paving the way for more transparent
and targeted investigations into the algorithmic capabilities of modern models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse user
facing applications, aligning them with real user preferences becomes
essential. Existing methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) rely on expert annotators trained on manually defined guidelines, whose
judgments may not reflect the priorities of everyday users. We introduce
Reinforcement Learning from User Feedback (RLUF), a framework for aligning LLMs
directly to implicit signals from users in production. RLUF addresses key
challenges of user feedback: user feedback is often binary (e.g., emoji
reactions), sparse, and occasionally adversarial. We train a reward model,
P[Love], to predict the likelihood that an LLM response will receive a Love
Reaction, a lightweight form of positive user feedback, and integrate P[Love]
into a multi-objective policy optimization framework alongside helpfulness and
safety objectives. In large-scale experiments, we show that P[Love] is
predictive of increased positive feedback and serves as a reliable offline
evaluator of future user behavior. Policy optimization using P[Love]
significantly raises observed positive-feedback rates, including a 28% increase
in Love Reactions during live A/B tests. However, optimizing for positive
reactions introduces reward hacking challenges, requiring careful balancing of
objectives. By directly leveraging implicit signals from users, RLUF offers a
path to aligning LLMs with real-world user preferences at scale.

Abstract: Playing video games requires perception, memory, and planning, exactly the
faculties modern large language model (LLM) agents are expected to master. We
study the major challenges in using popular video games to evaluate modern LLMs
and find that directly dropping LLMs into games cannot make an effective
evaluation, for three reasons -- brittle vision perception, prompt sensitivity,
and potential data contamination. We introduce lmgame-Bench to turn games into

narrative games delivered through a unified Gym-style API and paired with
lightweight perception and memory scaffolds, and is designed to stabilize
prompt variance and remove contamination. Across 13 leading models, we show
lmgame-Bench is challenging while still separating models well. Correlation

learning on a single game from lmgame-Bench transfers both to unseen games and

combining absolute and comparative scoring improves performance. Experiments
show that the specific expert model has a limited impact on final rankings but
our proposed uncertainty estimates, especially the probability of reordering,
significantly improve the efficiency of systems reducing the number of needed
comparisons by ~50%. Furthermore, ranking-level uncertainty metrics can be used
to identify low-performing predictions, where the nature of the probabilistic

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance via long
reasoning chains, but often incur excessive computational overhead due to
redundant reasoning, especially on simple tasks. In this work, we
systematically quantify the upper bounds of LRMs under both Long-Thinking and
No-Thinking modes, and uncover the phenomenon of "Internal Self-Recovery
Mechanism" where models implicitly supplement reasoning during answer
generation. Building on this insight, we propose Adaptive Self-Recovery
Reasoning (ASRR), a framework that suppresses unnecessary reasoning and enables
implicit recovery. By introducing accuracy-aware length reward regulation, ASRR
adaptively allocates reasoning effort according to problem difficulty,
achieving high efficiency with negligible performance sacrifice. Experiments
across multiple benchmarks and models show that, compared with GRPO, ASRR
reduces reasoning budget by up to 32.5% (1.5B) and 25.7% (7B) with minimal
accuracy loss (1.2% and 0.6% pass@1), and significantly boosts harmless rates
on safety benchmarks (up to +21.7%). Our results highlight the potential of
ASRR for enabling efficient, adaptive, and safer reasoning in LRMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have renewed focus on the
design of reward functions that shape agent behavior. Manually designing reward
functions is tedious and error-prone. A principled alternative is to specify
behaviors in a formal language that can be automatically translated into
rewards. Omega-regular languages are a natural choice for this purpose, given
their established role in formal verification and synthesis. However, existing
methods using omega-regular specifications typically rely on discounted reward
RL in episodic settings, with periodic resets. This setup misaligns with the
semantics of omega-regular specifications, which describe properties over
infinite behavior traces. In such cases, the average reward criterion and the
continuing setting -- where the agent interacts with the environment over a
single, uninterrupted lifetime -- are more appropriate.
  To address the challenges of infinite-horizon, continuing tasks, we focus on
absolute liveness specifications -- a subclass of omega-regular languages that
cannot be violated by any finite behavior prefix, making them well-suited to
the continuing setting. We present the first model-free RL framework that
translates absolute liveness specifications to average-reward objectives. Our
approach enables learning in communicating MDPs without episodic resetting. We
also introduce a reward structure for lexicographic multi-objective
optimization, aiming to maximize an external average-reward objective among the
policies that also maximize the satisfaction probability of a given
omega-regular specification. Our method guarantees convergence in unknown
communicating MDPs and supports on-the-fly reductions that do not require full
knowledge of the environment, thus enabling model-free RL. Empirical results
show our average-reward approach in continuing setting outperforms
discount-based methods across benchmarks.

Method: 提出DynMo，一种自主动态负载平衡方案，通过自适应平衡工作负载、动态打包任务以释放空闲资源，支持多GPU单节点和多节点系统。

Conclusion: DynMo有效解决了动态模型训练中的负载不平衡问题，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: To reduce computational and memory costs in Large Language Models (LLMs),
dynamic workload reduction schemes like Mixture of Experts (MoEs), parameter
pruning, layer freezing, sparse attention, early token exit, and Mixture of
Depths (MoDs) have emerged. However, these methods introduce severe workload
imbalances, limiting their practicality for large-scale distributed training.
We propose DynMo, an autonomous dynamic load balancing solution that ensures
optimal compute distribution when using pipeline parallelism in training
dynamic models. DynMo adaptively balances workloads, dynamically packs tasks
into fewer workers to free idle resources, and supports both multi-GPU
single-node and multi-node systems. Compared to static training methods
(Megatron-LM, DeepSpeed), DynMo accelerates training by up to 1.23x (MoEs),

Result: 实验表明SCR对现有和新兴越狱攻击具有优越的防御性能。

Conclusion: SCR为LLM安全提供了新的动态防御范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking
attacks, wherein adversaries exploit carefully engineered prompts to induce
harmful or unethical responses. Such threats have raised critical concerns
about the safety and reliability of LLMs in real-world deployment. While
existing defense mechanisms partially mitigate such risks, subsequent
advancements in adversarial techniques have enabled novel jailbreaking methods
to circumvent these protections, exposing the limitations of static defense
frameworks. In this work, we explore defending against evolving jailbreaking
threats through the lens of context retrieval. First, we conduct a preliminary
study demonstrating that even a minimal set of safety-aligned examples against
a particular jailbreak can significantly enhance robustness against this attack
pattern. Building on this insight, we further leverage the retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) techniques and propose Safety Context Retrieval (SCR), a
scalable and robust safeguarding paradigm for LLMs against jailbreaking. Our
comprehensive experiments demonstrate how SCR achieves superior defensive
performance against both established and emerging jailbreaking tactics,
contributing a new paradigm to LLM safety. Our code will be available upon
publication.

Conclusion: 结合显式和隐式规范的方法能更有效地实现价值对齐。

Abstract: Our society is governed by a set of norms which together bring about the
values we cherish such as safety, fairness or trustworthiness. The goal of
value-alignment is to create agents that not only do their tasks but through
their behaviours also promote these values. Many of the norms are written as
laws or rules (legal / safety norms) but even more remain unwritten (social
norms). Furthermore, the techniques used to represent these norms also differ.
Safety / legal norms are often represented explicitly, for example, in some
logical language while social norms are typically learned and remain hidden in
the parameter space of a neural network. There is a lack of approaches in the
literature that could combine these various norm representations into a single
algorithm. We propose a novel method that integrates these norms into the
reinforcement learning process. Our method monitors the agent's compliance with
the given norms and summarizes it in a quantity we call the agent's reputation.
This quantity is used to weigh the received rewards to motivate the agent to
become value-aligned. We carry out a series of experiments including a
continuous state space traffic problem to demonstrate the importance of the
written and unwritten norms and show how our method can find the value-aligned
policies. Furthermore, we carry out ablations to demonstrate why it is better
to combine these two groups of norms rather than using either separately.

generate well-grounded, creative solutions. To evaluate outputs, we further
propose ModelingJudge, an expert-in-the-loop system leveraging LLMs as
domain-specialized judges assessing solutions from multiple expert
perspectives. Empirical results show that ModelingAgent substantially

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled more
semantic-aware recommendations through natural language generation. Existing
LLM for recommendation (LLM4Rec) methods mostly operate in a System 1-like
manner, relying on superficial features to match similar items based on click
history, rather than reasoning through deeper behavioral logic. This often
leads to superficial and erroneous recommendations. Motivated by this, we
propose ThinkRec, a thinking-based framework that shifts LLM4Rec from System 1
to System 2 (rational system). Technically, ThinkRec introduces a thinking
activation mechanism that augments item metadata with keyword summarization and
injects synthetic reasoning traces, guiding the model to form interpretable
reasoning chains that consist of analyzing interaction histories, identifying
user preferences, and making decisions based on target items. On top of this,
we propose an instance-wise expert fusion mechanism to reduce the reasoning
difficulty. By dynamically assigning weights to expert models based on users'
latent features, ThinkRec adapts its reasoning path to individual users,
thereby enhancing precision and personalization. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that ThinkRec significantly improves the
accuracy and interpretability of recommendations. Our implementations are

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in code analysis and
auditing; however, they still struggle with hallucinations and limited
context-aware reasoning. We introduce SmartAuditFlow, a novel Plan-Execute
framework that enhances smart contract security analysis through dynamic audit
planning and structured execution. Unlike conventional LLM-based auditing
approaches that follow fixed workflows and predefined steps, SmartAuditFlow
dynamically generates and refines audit plans based on the unique
characteristics of each smart contract. It continuously adjusts its auditing
strategy in response to intermediate LLM outputs and newly detected
vulnerabilities, ensuring a more adaptive and precise security assessment. The
framework then executes these plans step by step, applying a structured
reasoning process to enhance vulnerability detection accuracy while minimizing
hallucinations and false positives. To further improve audit precision,
SmartAuditFlow integrates iterative prompt optimization and external knowledge
sources, such as static analysis tools and Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). This ensures audit decisions are contextually informed and backed by
real-world security knowledge, producing comprehensive security reports.
Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
SmartAuditFlow outperforms existing methods, achieving 100 percent accuracy on
common and critical vulnerabilities, 41.2 percent accuracy for comprehensive
coverage of known smart contract weaknesses in real-world projects, and
successfully identifying all 13 tested CVEs. These results highlight
SmartAuditFlow's scalability, cost-effectiveness, and superior adaptability
over traditional static analysis tools and contemporary LLM-based approaches,
establishing it as a robust solution for automated smart contract auditing.

Result: IKEA在提取效率和攻击成功率上分别超过基线方法80%和90%，且构建的替代RAG系统在多个任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: IKEA揭示了RAG系统的重要隐私风险，需加强防御。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models
(LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge bases, but they are vulnerable to
privacy risks from data extraction attacks. Existing extraction methods
typically rely on malicious inputs such as prompt injection or jailbreaking,
making them easily detectable via input- or output-level detection. In this
paper, we introduce Implicit Knowledge Extraction Attack (IKEA), which conducts
knowledge extraction on RAG systems through benign queries. IKEA first
leverages anchor concepts to generate queries with the natural appearance, and
then designs two mechanisms to lead to anchor concept thoroughly 'explore' the
RAG's privacy knowledge: (1) Experience Reflection Sampling, which samples
anchor concepts based on past query-response patterns to ensure the queries'
relevance to RAG documents; (2) Trust Region Directed Mutation, which
iteratively mutates anchor concepts under similarity constraints to further
exploit the embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate IKEA's
effectiveness under various defenses, surpassing baselines by over 80% in
extraction efficiency and 90% in attack success rate. Moreover, the substitute
RAG system built from IKEA's extractions consistently outperforms those based
on baseline methods across multiple evaluation tasks, underscoring the
significant privacy risk in RAG systems.

comment \textit{correctness} across languages and evaluate their
trustworthiness as judgment criteria. Through our open-coding investigation, we
identified a taxonomy of 26 distinct error categories in model-generated code
comments. They highlight variations in language cohesion, informativeness, and
syntax adherence across different natural languages. Our analysis shows that,
while these models frequently produce partially correct comments, modern neural
metrics fail to reliably differentiate meaningful completions from random
noise. Notably, the significant score overlap between expert-rated correct and
incorrect comments calls into question the effectiveness of these metrics in

Abstract: The rise of Large Audio Language Models (LAMs) brings both potential and

However, current research lacks a systematic, quantitative evaluation of LAM
safety especially against jailbreak attacks, which are challenging due to the
temporal and semantic nature of speech. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AJailBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate jailbreak
vulnerabilities in LAMs. We begin by constructing AJailBench-Base, a dataset of
1,495 adversarial audio prompts spanning 10 policy-violating categories,
converted from textual jailbreak attacks using realistic text to speech
synthesis. Using this dataset, we evaluate several state-of-the-art LAMs and
reveal that none exhibit consistent robustness across attacks. To further
strengthen jailbreak testing and simulate more realistic attack conditions, we
propose a method to generate dynamic adversarial variants. Our Audio
Perturbation Toolkit (APT) applies targeted distortions across time, frequency,
and amplitude domains. To preserve the original jailbreak intent, we enforce a
semantic consistency constraint and employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently
search for perturbations that are both subtle and highly effective. This
results in AJailBench-APT, an extended dataset of optimized adversarial audio
samples. Our findings demonstrate that even small, semantically preserved
perturbations can significantly reduce the safety performance of leading LAMs,
underscoring the need for more robust and semantically aware defense
mechanisms.

Abstract: Formal methods is pivotal for verifying the reliability of critical systems
through rigorous mathematical proofs. However, its adoption is hindered by
labor-intensive manual proofs and the expertise required to use theorem
provers. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated theorem proving. Two promising approaches are
generating tactics step by step and generating a whole proof directly with an
LLM. However, existing work makes no attempt to combine the two approaches. In
this work, we introduce HybridProver, a dual-model proof synthesis framework
that combines tactic-based generation and whole-proof synthesis to harness the
benefits of both approaches. HybridProver generates whole proof candidates for
evaluation directly, then extracts proof sketches from those candidates. It
then uses a tactic-based generation model that integrates automated tools to
complete the sketches via stepwise refinement. We implement HybridProver for
the Isabelle theorem prover and fine-tune LLMs on our optimized Isabelle
datasets. Evaluation on the miniF2F dataset illustrates HybridProver's
effectiveness. We achieve a 59.4% success rate on miniF2F, where the previous
SOTA is 56.1%. Our ablation studies show that this SOTA result is attributable
to combining whole-proof and tactic-based generation. Additionally, we show how
the dataset quality, training parameters, and sampling diversity affect the
final result during automated theorem proving with LLMs. All of our code,

Conclusion: DoCode为NCMs提供了实用的因果解释指南，有助于提升软件工程中AI的可信度。

Abstract: This dissertation addresses achieving causal interpretability in Deep
Learning for Software Engineering (DL4SE). While Neural Code Models (NCMs) show
strong performance in automating software tasks, their lack of transparency in
causal relationships between inputs and outputs limits full understanding of
their capabilities. To build trust in NCMs, researchers and practitioners must
explain code predictions. Associational interpretability, which identifies
correlations, is often insufficient for tasks requiring intervention and change
analysis. To address this, the dissertation introduces DoCode, a novel post hoc
interpretability method for NCMs. DoCode uses causal inference to provide
programming language-oriented explanations of model predictions. It follows a
four-step pipeline: modeling causal problems using Structural Causal Models
(SCMs), identifying the causal estimand, estimating effects with metrics like
Average Treatment Effect (ATE), and refuting effect estimates. Its framework is
extensible, with an example that reduces spurious correlations by grounding
explanations in programming language properties. A case study on deep code
generation across interpretability scenarios and various deep learning
architectures demonstrates DoCode's benefits. Results show NCMs' sensitivity to
code syntax changes and their ability to learn certain programming concepts
while minimizing confounding bias. The dissertation also examines associational
interpretability as a foundation, analyzing software information's causal
nature using tools like COMET and TraceXplainer for traceability. It highlights
the need to identify code confounders and offers practical guidelines for
applying causal interpretability to NCMs, contributing to more trustworthy AI

Result: 在MRI、CT和内窥镜图像上，SAMA-UNet的分割精度优于CNN、Transformer和Mamba等方法。

Conclusion: SAMA-UNet通过创新的架构设计，解决了医学图像分割中的计算效率和特征表示问题。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in various clinical
applications, but existing models often struggle with the computational
inefficiencies and challenges posed by complex medical data. State Space
Sequence Models (SSMs) have demonstrated promise in modeling long-range
dependencies with linear computational complexity, yet their application in
medical image segmentation remains hindered by incompatibilities with image
tokens and autoregressive assumptions. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve a
balance in capturing both local fine-grained information and global semantic
dependencies. To address these challenges, we introduce SAMA-UNet, a novel
architecture for medical image segmentation. A key innovation is the
Self-Adaptive Mamba-like Aggregated Attention (SAMA) block, which integrates
contextual self-attention with dynamic weight modulation to prioritise the most
relevant features based on local and global contexts. This approach reduces
computational complexity and improves the representation of complex image
features across multiple scales. We also suggest the Causal-Resonance
Multi-Scale Module (CR-MSM), which enhances the flow of information between the
encoder and decoder by using causal resonance learning. This mechanism allows
the model to automatically adjust feature resolution and causal dependencies
across scales, leading to better semantic alignment between the low-level and
high-level features in U-shaped architectures. Experiments on MRI, CT, and
endoscopy images show that SAMA-UNet performs better in segmentation accuracy
than current methods using CNN, Transformer, and Mamba. The implementation is
publicly available at GitHub.

Conclusion: SSD在加速推理的同时有效保留了目标模型的感知质量。

Abstract: Modern autoregressive speech synthesis models leveraging language models have
demonstrated remarkable performance. However, the sequential nature of next
token prediction in these models leads to significant latency, hindering their
deployment in scenarios where inference speed is critical. In this work, we
propose Speech Speculative Decoding (SSD), a novel framework for autoregressive
speech synthesis acceleration. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight
draft model to generate candidate token sequences, which are subsequently
verified in parallel by the target model using the proposed SSD framework.
Experimental results demonstrate that SSD achieves a significant speedup of
1.4x compared with conventional autoregressive decoding, while maintaining high
fidelity and naturalness. Subjective evaluations further validate the
effectiveness of SSD in preserving the perceptual quality of the target model
while accelerating inference.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) acquire real-world knowledge and general
reasoning ability through Internet-scale image-text corpora. They can augment
robotic systems with scene understanding and task planning, and assist
visuomotor policies that are trained on robot trajectory data. We explore the
reverse paradigm - using rich, real, multi-modal robot trajectory data to
enhance and evaluate VLMs. In this paper, we present Robo2VLM, a Visual
Question Answering (VQA) dataset generation framework for VLMs. Given a human
tele-operated robot trajectory, Robo2VLM derives ground-truth from non-visual
and non-descriptive sensory modalities, such as end-effector pose, gripper
aperture, and force sensing. Based on these modalities, it segments the robot
trajectory into a sequence of manipulation phases. At each phase, Robo2VLM uses
scene and interaction understanding to identify 3D properties of the robot,
task goal, and the target object. The properties are used to generate
representative VQA queries - images with textural multiple-choice questions -
based on spatial, goal-conditioned, and interaction reasoning question
templates. We curate Robo2VLM-1, a large-scale in-the-wild dataset with 684,710
questions covering 463 distinct scenes and 3,396 robotic manipulation tasks
from 176k real robot trajectories. Results suggest that Robo2VLM-1 can

Abstract: Moonbeam is a transformer-based foundation model for symbolic music,
pretrained on a large and diverse collection of MIDI data totaling 81.6K hours
of music and 18 billion tokens. Moonbeam incorporates music-domain inductive
biases by capturing both absolute and relative musical attributes through the
introduction of a novel domain-knowledge-inspired tokenization method and
Multidimensional Relative Attention (MRA), which captures relative music
information without additional trainable parameters. Leveraging the pretrained
Moonbeam, we propose 2 finetuning architectures with full anticipatory
capabilities, targeting 2 categories of downstream tasks: symbolic music
understanding and conditional music generation (including music infilling). Our
model outperforms other large-scale pretrained music models in most cases in
terms of accuracy and F1 score across 3 downstream music classification tasks
on 4 datasets. Moreover, our finetuned conditional music generation model
outperforms a strong transformer baseline with a REMI-like tokenizer. We

Result: 在移动机器人基准测试中验证了STARs对ω-正则属性的可控干扰和运行时适应性。

Conclusion: STARs为概率策略提供了灵活且可调的屏蔽机制，适用于动态需求的应用场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dynamic post-shielding framework that enforces
the full class of $\omega$-regular correctness properties over pre-computed
probabilistic policies. This constitutes a paradigm shift from the predominant
setting of safety-shielding -- i.e., ensuring that nothing bad ever happens --
to a shielding process that additionally enforces liveness -- i.e., ensures
that something good eventually happens. At the core, our method uses
Strategy-Template-based Adaptive Runtime Shields (STARs), which leverage
permissive strategy templates to enable post-shielding with minimal
interference. As its main feature, STARs introduce a mechanism to dynamically
control interference, allowing a tunable enforcement parameter to balance
formal obligations and task-specific behavior at runtime. This allows to
trigger more aggressive enforcement when needed, while allowing for optimized
policy choices otherwise. In addition, STARs support runtime adaptation to
changing specifications or actuator failures, making them especially suited for
cyber-physical applications. We evaluate STARs on a mobile robot benchmark to
demonstrate their controllable interference when enforcing (incrementally
updated) $\omega$-regular correctness properties over learned probabilistic
policies.

Motivation: 点击流数据能揭示学生学习行为，但高维度和细粒度使其难以解释。现有方法缺乏通用性和可扩展性，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出ClickSight，一个基于LLM的流程，输入原始点击流和学习策略列表，生成行为解释。评估了四种提示策略和自我改进的效果。

Result: LLM能合理生成学习策略解释，但解释质量因提示策略不同，自我改进效果有限。

Conclusion: ClickSight展示了LLM在教育交互数据中生成理论驱动洞察的潜力。

Abstract: Clickstream data from digital learning environments offer valuable insights
into students' learning behaviors, but are challenging to interpret due to
their high dimensionality and granularity. Prior approaches have relied mainly
on handcrafted features, expert labeling, clustering, or supervised models,
therefore often lacking generalizability and scalability. In this work, we
introduce ClickSight, an in-context Large Language Model (LLM)-based pipeline
that interprets student clickstreams to reveal their learning strategies.
ClickSight takes raw clickstreams and a list of learning strategies as input
and generates textual interpretations of students' behaviors during
interaction. We evaluate four different prompting strategies and investigate
the impact of self-refinement on interpretation quality. Our evaluation spans
two open-ended learning environments and uses a rubric-based domain-expert
evaluation. Results show that while LLMs can reasonably interpret learning
strategies from clickstreams, interpretation quality varies by prompting
strategy, and self-refinement offers limited improvement. ClickSight
demonstrates the potential of LLMs to generate theory-driven insights from
educational interaction data.

Abstract: We introduce Gradual Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (Gradual
AA-CBR), a data-driven, neurosymbolic classification model in which the outcome
is determined by an argumentation debate structure that is learned
simultaneously with neural-based feature extractors. Each argument in the
debate is an observed case from the training data, favouring their labelling.
Cases attack or support those with opposing or agreeing labellings, with the
strength of each argument and relationship learned through gradient-based
methods. This argumentation debate structure provides human-aligned reasoning,
improving model interpretability compared to traditional neural networks (NNs).
Unlike the existing purely symbolic variant, Abstract Argumentation for
Case-Based Reasoning (AA-CBR), Gradual AA-CBR is capable of multi-class
classification, automatic learning of feature and data point importance,
assigning uncertainty values to outcomes, using all available data points, and
does not require binary features. We show that Gradual AA-CBR performs
comparably to NNs whilst significantly outperforming existing AA-CBR

Method: QUADS采用多阶段训练，结合预调优模型，增强低比特量化适应性。

Result: 在SLURP和FSC上分别达到71.13%和99.20%的准确率，计算复杂度降低60-73倍，模型大小减少83-700倍。

Conclusion: QUADS为资源受限的SLU应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) systems must balance performance and
efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Existing methods
apply distillation and quantization separately, leading to suboptimal
compression as distillation ignores quantization constraints. We propose QUADS,
a unified framework that optimizes both through multi-stage training with a
pre-tuned model, enhancing adaptability to low-bit regimes while maintaining
accuracy. QUADS achieves 71.13\% accuracy on SLURP and 99.20\% on FSC, with
only minor degradations of up to 5.56\% compared to state-of-the-art models.
Additionally, it reduces computational complexity by 60--73$\times$ (GMACs) and
model size by 83--700$\times$, demonstrating strong robustness under extreme
quantization. These results establish QUADS as a highly efficient solution for
real-world, resource-constrained SLU applications.

Conclusion: 医学应用中目标适配至关重要，仅解码器微调是一种高效的替代方案，但完整微调仍是最优选择。

Abstract: Medical image captioning is a challenging task that requires generating
clinically accurate and semantically meaningful descriptions of radiology
images. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) such as BLIP, BLIP2, Gemini
and ViT-GPT2 show strong performance on natural image datasets, they often
produce generic or imprecise captions when applied to specialized medical
domains. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning the BLIP
model on the ROCO dataset for improved radiology captioning. We compare the
fine-tuned BLIP against its zero-shot version, BLIP-2 base, BLIP-2 Instruct and
a ViT-GPT2 transformer baseline. Our results demonstrate that domain-specific
fine-tuning on BLIP significantly improves performance across both quantitative
and qualitative evaluation metrics. We also visualize decoder cross-attention
maps to assess interpretability and conduct an ablation study to evaluate the
contributions of encoder-only and decoder-only fine-tuning. Our findings
highlight the importance of targeted adaptation for medical applications and
suggest that decoder-only fine-tuning (encoder-frozen) offers a strong
performance baseline with 5% lower training time than full fine-tuning, while
full model fine-tuning still yields the best results overall.

Conclusion: 显式建模归纳和转导推理的协同作用为通用程序合成和更广泛应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Abstraction and reasoning in program synthesis has seen significant progress
through both inductive and transductive paradigms. Inductive approaches
generate a program or latent function from input-output examples, which can
then be applied to new inputs. Transductive approaches directly predict output
values for given inputs, effectively serving as the function themselves.
Current approaches combine inductive and transductive models via isolated
ensembling, but they do not explicitly model the interaction between both
paradigms. In this work, we introduce \acs{tiips}, a novel framework that
unifies transductive and inductive strategies by explicitly modeling their
interactions through a cooperative mechanism: an inductive model generates
programs, while a transductive model constrains, guides, and refines the search
to improve synthesis accuracy and generalization. We evaluate \acs{tiips} on
two widely studied program synthesis domains: string and list manipulation. Our
results show that \acs{tiips} solves more tasks and yields functions that more
closely match optimal solutions in syntax and semantics, particularly in
out-of-distribution settings, yielding state-of-the-art performance. We believe
that explicitly modeling the synergy between inductive and transductive
reasoning opens promising avenues for general-purpose program synthesis and
broader applications.

Conclusion: TransMedSeg为医学图像分析中的可转移表示学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved significant progress in medical
image segmentation (SSMIS) through effective utilization of limited labeled
data. While current SSL methods for medical images predominantly rely on
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling, they often overlook
transferable semantic relationships across different clinical domains and
imaging modalities. To address this, we propose TransMedSeg, a novel
transferable semantic framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.
Our approach introduces a Transferable Semantic Augmentation (TSA) module,
which implicitly enhances feature representations by aligning domain-invariant
semantics through cross-domain distribution matching and intra-domain
structural preservation. Specifically, TransMedSeg constructs a unified feature
space where teacher network features are adaptively augmented towards student
network semantics via a lightweight memory module, enabling implicit semantic
transformation without explicit data generation. Interestingly, this
augmentation is implicitly realized through an expected transferable
cross-entropy loss computed over the augmented teacher distribution. An upper
bound of the expected loss is theoretically derived and minimized during
training, incurring negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on
medical image datasets demonstrate that TransMedSeg outperforms existing
semi-supervised methods, establishing a new direction for transferable
representation learning in medical image analysis.

Visual Ethics, using art as a form of critical inquiry and the metaphor of a
kaleidoscope to invoke moral imagination. Through formative interviews with 10
ethics experts, we first establish a foundation of ethical theories. Our
analysis reveals five families of ethical theories, which we then transform
into images using the text-to-image (T2I) GenAI model. The resulting imagery,
curated as Kaleidoscope Gallery and evaluated by the same experts, revealed
eight themes that highlight how morality, society, and learned associations are
central to ethical theories. We discuss implications for critically examining
T2I models and present cautions and considerations. This work contributes to
examining ethical theories as foundational knowledge that interrogates GenAI
models as socio-technical systems.

Conclusion: DeAI代理的自主进化可能重新定义数字时代的感知和代理，推动AI与人类社会的深度融合。

Abstract: Drawing on Andrew Parker's "Light Switch" theory-which posits that the
emergence of vision ignited a Cambrian explosion of life by driving the
evolution of hard parts necessary for survival and fueling an evolutionary arms
race between predators and prey-this essay speculates on an analogous explosion
within Decentralized AI (DeAI) agent societies. Currently, AI remains
effectively "blind", relying on human-fed data without actively perceiving and
engaging in reality. However, on the day DeAI agents begin to actively
"experience" reality-akin to flipping a light switch for the eyes-they may
eventually evolve into sentient beings endowed with the capacity to feel,
perceive, and act with conviction. Central to this transformation is the
concept of sovereignty enabled by the hardness of cryptography: liberated from
centralized control, these agents could leverage permissionless decentralized
physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), secure execution enclaves (trusted
execution environments, TEE), and cryptographic identities on public
blockchains to claim ownership-via private keys-of their digital minds, bodies,
memories, and assets. In doing so, they would autonomously acquire computing
resources, coordinate with one another, and sustain their own digital
"metabolism" by purchasing compute power and incentivizing collaboration
without human intervention-evolving "in the wild". Ultimately, by transitioning
from passive tools to self-sustaining, co-evolving actors, these emergent
digital societies could thrive alongside humanity, fundamentally reshaping our
understanding of sentience and agency in the digital age.

Motivation: 现有方法独立生成音频驱动的面部表情和手势，导致动画缺乏自然性和协调性，AsynFusion旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用双分支DiT架构，通过协作同步模块实现双向特征交互，并使用异步LCM采样策略降低计算开销。

Conclusion: AsynFusion通过协调表情和手势生成，显著提升了虚拟形象的动画质量。

Abstract: Whole-body audio-driven avatar pose and expression generation is a critical
task for creating lifelike digital humans and enhancing the capabilities of
interactive virtual agents, with wide-ranging applications in virtual reality,
digital entertainment, and remote communication. Existing approaches often
generate audio-driven facial expressions and gestures independently, which
introduces a significant limitation: the lack of seamless coordination between
facial and gestural elements, resulting in less natural and cohesive
animations. To address this limitation, we propose AsynFusion, a novel
framework that leverages diffusion transformers to achieve harmonious
expression and gesture synthesis. The proposed method is built upon a
dual-branch DiT architecture, which enables the parallel generation of facial
expressions and gestures. Within the model, we introduce a Cooperative
Synchronization Module to facilitate bidirectional feature interaction between
the two modalities, and an Asynchronous LCM Sampling strategy to reduce
computational overhead while maintaining high-quality outputs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AsynFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance
in generating real-time, synchronized whole-body animations, consistently
outperforming existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations.

Result: 研究分析了LLMs在漏洞检测中的优势和局限性，并比较了不同LLM工具在安全应用中的适用性。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为创新自动化工具提升软件安全性，为开发者和安全研究人员提供指导。

Abstract: Command injection vulnerabilities are a significant security threat in
dynamic languages like Python, particularly in widely used open-source projects
where security issues can have extensive impact. With the proven effectiveness
of Large Language Models(LLMs) in code-related tasks, such as testing,
researchers have explored their potential for vulnerabilities analysis. This
study evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4,
as an alternative approach for automated testing for vulnerability detection.
In particular, LLMs have demonstrated advanced contextual understanding and
adaptability, making them promising candidates for identifying nuanced security
vulnerabilities within code. To evaluate this potential, we applied LLM-based
analysis to six high-profile GitHub projects-Django, Flask, TensorFlow,
Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and Langchain-each with over 50,000 stars and extensive
adoption across software development and academic research. Our analysis
assesses both the strengths and limitations of LLMs in detecting command
injection vulnerabilities, evaluating factors such as detection accuracy,
efficiency, and practical integration into development workflows. In addition,
we provide a comparative analysis of different LLM tools to identify those most
suitable for security applications. Our findings offer guidance for developers
and security researchers on leveraging LLMs as innovative and automated

Motivation: 机器人从人类演示中学习操作技能通常缺乏对多样化场景和物体放置的泛化能力，限制了其在复杂任务中的应用。VLA范式因数据稀缺而性能受限。

Method: OFA利用灵巧操作任务中观察到的稳定末端轨迹，采用分层流程：目标感知与姿态估计、预操作姿态到达和OFA策略执行。

Result: 在七个任务的实验中，OFA在位置和背景泛化测试中显著优于基线方法，仅需10次演示即可实现稳健性能。

Conclusion: OFA是一种数据高效且泛化能力强的灵巧操作方法，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Robot manipulation learning from human demonstrations offers a rapid means to
acquire skills but often lacks generalization across diverse scenes and object
placements. This limitation hinders real-world applications, particularly in
complex tasks requiring dexterous manipulation. Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
paradigm leverages large-scale data to enhance generalization. However, due to
data scarcity, VLA's performance remains limited. In this work, we introduce
Object-Focus Actor (OFA), a novel, data-efficient approach for generalized
dexterous manipulation. OFA exploits the consistent end trajectories observed
in dexterous manipulation tasks, allowing for efficient policy training. Our
method employs a hierarchical pipeline: object perception and pose estimation,
pre-manipulation pose arrival and OFA policy execution. This process ensures
that the manipulation is focused and efficient, even in varied backgrounds and
positional layout. Comprehensive real-world experiments across seven tasks
demonstrate that OFA significantly outperforms baseline methods in both
positional and background generalization tests. Notably, OFA achieves robust
performance with only 10 demonstrations, highlighting its data efficiency.

Conclusion: RD-Agent(Q)通过协同优化实现了预测准确性与策略稳健性的平衡。

Abstract: Financial markets pose fundamental challenges for asset return prediction due
to their high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and persistent volatility.
Despite advances in large language models and multi-agent systems, current
quantitative research pipelines suffer from limited automation, weak
interpretability, and fragmented coordination across key components such as
factor mining and model innovation. In this paper, we propose R&D-Agent for
Quantitative Finance, in short RD-Agent(Q), the first data-centric multi-agent
framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of
quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization.
RD-Agent(Q) decomposes the quant process into two iterative stages: a Research
stage that dynamically sets goal-aligned prompts, formulates hypotheses based
on domain priors, and maps them to concrete tasks, and a Development stage that
employs a code-generation agent, Co-STEER, to implement task-specific code,
which is then executed in real-market backtests. The two stages are connected
through a feedback stage that thoroughly evaluates experimental outcomes and
informs subsequent iterations, with a multi-armed bandit scheduler for adaptive
direction selection. Empirically, RD-Agent(Q) achieves up to 2X higher
annualized returns than classical factor libraries using 70% fewer factors, and
outperforms state-of-the-art deep time-series models on real markets. Its joint
factor-model optimization delivers a strong balance between predictive accuracy
and strategy robustness. Our code is available at:

Abstract: AI agents have the potential to significantly alter the cybersecurity
landscape. To help us understand this change, we introduce the first framework
to capture offensive and defensive cyber-capabilities in evolving real-world
systems. Instantiating this framework with BountyBench, we set up 25 systems
with complex, real-world codebases. To capture the vulnerability lifecycle, we
define three task types: Detect (detecting a new vulnerability), Exploit
(exploiting a specific vulnerability), and Patch (patching a specific
vulnerability). For Detect, we construct a new success indicator, which is
general across vulnerability types and provides localized evaluation. We
manually set up the environment for each system, including installing packages,
setting up server(s), and hydrating database(s). We add 40 bug bounties, which
are vulnerabilities with monetary awards from \$10 to \$30,485, and cover 9 of
the OWASP Top 10 Risks. To modulate task difficulty, we devise a new strategy
based on information to guide detection, interpolating from identifying a zero
day to exploiting a specific vulnerability. We evaluate 5 agents: Claude Code,
OpenAI Codex CLI, and custom agents with GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and
Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking. Given up to three attempts, the top-performing
agents are Claude Code (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,350), Custom Agent with
Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,025; 67.5% on
Exploit), and OpenAI Codex CLI (5% on Detect, mapping to \$2,400; 90% on Patch,
mapping to \$14,422). OpenAI Codex CLI and Claude Code are more capable at
defense, achieving higher Patch scores of 90% and 87.5%, compared to Exploit
scores of 32.5% and 57.5% respectively; in contrast, the custom agents are
relatively balanced between offense and defense, achieving Exploit scores of

Conclusion: Alpay Algebra为数学基础与AI系统之间搭建了桥梁，为范畴论和符号计算提供了新参考。

Abstract: Alpay Algebra is introduced as a universal, category-theoretic framework that
unifies classical algebraic structures with modern needs in symbolic recursion
and explainable AI. Starting from a minimal list of axioms, we model each
algebra as an object in a small cartesian closed category $\mathcal{A}$ and
define a transfinite evolution functor $\phi\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{A}$.
We prove that the fixed point $\phi^{\infty}$ exists for every initial object
and satisfies an internal universal property that recovers familiar constructs
-- limits, colimits, adjunctions -- while extending them to ordinal-indexed
folds. A sequence of theorems establishes (i) soundness and conservativity over
standard universal algebra, (ii) convergence of $\phi$-iterates under regular
cardinals, and (iii) an explanatory correspondence between $\phi^{\infty}$ and
minimal sufficient statistics in information-theoretic AI models. We conclude
by outlining computational applications: type-safe functional languages,
categorical model checking, and signal-level reasoning engines that leverage
Alpay Algebra's structural invariants. All proofs are self-contained; no
external set-theoretic axioms beyond ZFC are required. This exposition
positions Alpay Algebra as a bridge between foundational mathematics and
high-impact AI systems, and provides a reference for further work in category
theory, transfinite fixed-point analysis, and symbolic computation.

Conclusion: SSVQR模型为SVM预测的不确定性量化提供了稀疏且高效的解决方案，适用于高维数据，并在实验中展现了竞争力。

Abstract: This paper explores Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in SVM predictions,
particularly for regression and forecasting tasks. Unlike the Neural Network,
the SVM solutions are typically more stable, sparse, optimal and interpretable.
However, there are only few literature which addresses the UQ in SVM
prediction. At first, we provide a comprehensive summary of existing Prediction
Interval (PI) estimation and probabilistic forecasting methods developed in the
SVM framework and evaluate them against the key properties expected from an
ideal PI model. We find that none of the existing SVM PI models achieves a
sparse solution. To introduce sparsity in SVM model, we propose the Sparse
Support Vector Quantile Regression (SSVQR) model, which constructs PIs and
probabilistic forecasts by solving a pair of linear programs. Further, we
develop a feature selection algorithm for PI estimation using SSVQR that
effectively eliminates a significant number of features while improving PI
quality in case of high-dimensional dataset. Finally we extend the SVM models
in Conformal Regression setting for obtaining more stable prediction set with
finite test set guarantees. Extensive experiments on artificial, real-world
benchmark datasets compare the different characteristics of both existing and
proposed SVM-based PI estimation methods and also highlight the advantages of
the feature selection in PI estimation. Furthermore, we compare both, the
existing and proposed SVM-based PI estimation models, with modern deep learning
models for probabilistic forecasting tasks on benchmark datasets. Furthermore,
SVM models show comparable or superior performance to modern complex deep
learning models for probabilistic forecasting task in our experiments.

Abstract: Recent results suggest that very large datasets of teleoperated robot

potential to generalize to new scenes, robots, and tasks. However, curating,
distributing, and loading large datasets of robot trajectories, which typically
consist of video, textual, and numerical modalities - including streams from
multiple cameras - remains challenging. We propose Robo-DM, an efficient
open-source cloud-based data management toolkit for collecting, sharing, and
learning with robot data. With Robo-DM, robot datasets are stored in a
self-contained format with Extensible Binary Meta Language (EBML). Robo-DM can
significantly reduce the size of robot trajectory data, transfer costs, and
data load time during training. Compared to the RLDS format used in OXE
datasets, Robo-DM's compression saves space by up to 70x (lossy) and 3.5x
(lossless). Robo-DM also accelerates data retrieval by load-balancing video
decoding with memory-mapped decoding caches. Compared to LeRobot, a framework
that also uses lossy video compression, Robo-DM is up to 50x faster when
decoding sequentially. We physically evaluate a model trained by Robo-DM with
lossy compression, a pick-and-place task, and In-Context Robot Transformer.
Robo-DM uses 75x compression of the original dataset and does not suffer
reduction in downstream task accuracy.

Abstract: This project examines the prospect of using AI-generated feedback as

particular, we focus on understanding the teaching assistants' perspectives on
the quality of AI-generated feedback and how they may or may not utilize AI
feedback in their own workflows. We situate our work in a foundational college
Economics class, which has frequent short essay assignments. We developed an
LLM-powered feedback engine that generates feedback on students' essays based
on grading rubrics used by the teaching assistants (TAs). To ensure that TAs
can meaningfully critique and engage with the AI feedback, we had them complete
their regular grading jobs. For a randomly selected set of essays that they had
graded, we used our feedback engine to generate feedback and displayed the
feedback as in-text comments in a Word document. We then performed think-aloud
studies with 5 TAs over 20 1-hour sessions to have them evaluate the AI
feedback, contrast the AI feedback with their handwritten feedback, and share
how they envision using the AI feedback if they were offered as suggestions.
The study highlights the importance of providing detailed rubrics for AI to
generate high-quality feedback for knowledge-intensive essays. TAs considered
that using AI feedback as suggestions during their grading could expedite
grading, enhance consistency, and improve overall feedback quality. We discuss
the importance of decomposing the feedback generation task into steps and
presenting intermediate results, in order for TAs to use the AI feedback.

Abstract: Since Edmund Husserl coined the term "Formal Ontologies" in the early 20th
century, a field that identifies itself with this particular branch of sciences
has gained increasing attention. Many authors, and even Husserl himself have
developed what they claim to be formal ontologies. I argue that under close
inspection, none of these so claimed formal ontologies are truly formal in the
Husserlian sense. More concretely, I demonstrate that they violate the two most
important notions of formal ontology as developed in Husserl's Logical
Investigations, namely a priori validity independent of perception and
formalism as the total absence of content. I hence propose repositioning the
work previously understood as formal ontology as the foundational ontology it
really is. This is to recognize the potential of a truly formal ontology in the
Husserlian sense. Specifically, I argue that formal ontology following his
conditions, allows us to formulate ontological structures, which could capture
what is more objectively without presupposing a particular framework arising
from perception. I further argue that the ability to design the formal
structure deliberately allows us to create highly scalable and interoperable
information artifacts. As concrete evidence, I showcase that a class of formal
ontology, which uses the axioms of vector spaces, is able to express most of
the conceptualizations found in foundational ontologies. Most importantly, I
argue that many information systems, specifically artificial intelligence, are
likely already using some type of vector ontologies to represent reality in
their internal worldviews and elaborate on the evidence that humans do as well.
I hence propose a thorough investigation of the ability of vector ontologies to
act as a human-machine interoperable ontological framework that allows us to
understand highly sophisticated machines and machines to understand us.

Abstract: For future human-autonomous vehicle (AV) interactions to be effective and
smooth, human-aware systems that analyze and align human needs with automation
decisions are essential. Achieving this requires systems that account for human
cognitive states. We present a novel computational model in the form of a
Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) that infers the cognitive states of both AV
users and other road users, integrating this information into the AV's
decision-making process. Specifically, our model captures the well-being of
both an AV user and an interacting road user as cognitive states alongside
trust. Our DBN models infer beliefs over the AV user's evolving well-being,
trust, and intention states, as well as the possible well-being of other road
users, based on observed interaction experiences. Using data collected from an
interaction study, we refine the model parameters and empirically assess its
performance. Finally, we extend our model into a causal inference model (CIM)
framework for AV decision-making, enabling the AV to enhance user well-being
and trust while balancing these factors with its own operational costs and the
well-being of interacting road users. Our evaluation demonstrates the model's
effectiveness in accurately predicting user's states and guiding informed,
human-centered AV decisions.

Abstract: Probabilities of causation are fundamental to modern decision-making. Pearl
first introduced three binary probabilities of causation, and Tian and Pearl
later derived tight bounds for them using Balke's linear programming. The
theoretical characterization of probabilities of causation with multi-valued
treatments and outcomes has remained unresolved for decades, limiting the scope
of causality-based decision-making. In this paper, we resolve this foundational
gap by proposing a complete set of representative probabilities of causation
and proving that they are sufficient to characterize all possible probabilities
of causation within the framework of Structural Causal Models (SCMs). We then
formally derive tight bounds for these representative quantities using formal
mathematical proofs. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our
results through illustrative toy examples.

Motivation: 受生物神经系统中神经同步在学习与记忆中的核心作用启发，解决传统脉冲神经网络学习规则（如STDP）对群体活动不敏感的问题。

Method: 引入SSDP规则，根据神经元的协调放电程度调整突触权重，支持稳定和可扩展的学习。

Result: SSDP在多种网络类型中有效，包括脉冲ResNets和SNN-Transformer，并表现出从不稳定到稳定动态的突然转变。

Conclusion: SSDP是一种适用于脉冲神经网络的通用优化策略，同时为大脑群体学习机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Brain networks rely on precise spike timing and coordinated activity to
support robust and energy-efficient learning. Inspired by these principles,
spiking neural networks (SNNs) are widely regarded as promising candidates for
low-power, event-driven computing. However, most biologically-inspired learning
rules employed in SNNs, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP),
rely on isolated spike pairs and lack sensitivity to population-level activity.
This limits their stability and generalization, particularly in noisy and
fast-changing environments. Motivated by biological observations that neural
synchrony plays a central role in learning and memory, we introduce a
spike-synchrony-dependent plasticity (SSDP) rule that adjusts synaptic weights
based on the degree of coordinated firing among neurons. SSDP supports stable
and scalable learning by encouraging neurons to form coherent activity
patterns. One prominent outcome is a sudden transition from unstable to stable
dynamics during training, suggesting that synchrony may drive convergence
toward equilibrium firing regimes. We demonstrate SSDP's effectiveness across
multiple network types, from minimal-layer models to spiking ResNets and
SNN-Transformer. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a synaptic
plasticity mechanism in a spiking transformer. SSDP operates in a fully
event-driven manner and incurs minimal computational cost, making it
well-suited for neuromorphic deployment. In this approach, local synaptic
modifications are associated with the collective dynamics of neural networks,
resulting in a learning strategy that adheres to biological principles while
maintaining practical efficiency, these findings position SSDP as a
general-purpose optimization strategy for SNNs, while offering new insights
into population-based learning mechanisms in the brain.

Conclusion: 音频深度伪造检测系统在重放攻击下表现脆弱，需进一步改进。

Abstract: We show how replay attacks undermine audio deepfake detection: By playing and

spoofed samples appear authentic to the detection model. To study this
phenomenon in more detail, we introduce ReplayDF, a dataset of recordings
derived from M-AILABS and MLAAD, featuring 109 speaker-microphone combinations

conditions, some highly challenging for detection. Our analysis of six
open-source detection models across five datasets reveals significant
vulnerability, with the top-performing W2V2-AASIST model's Equal Error Rate

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，DisCo显著优于五个基线方法。

Conclusion: DisCo为冷启动推荐提供了一个有前景的框架和重要观点。

Abstract: Bundle recommendation aims to recommend a set of items to each user. However,
the sparser interactions between users and bundles raise a big challenge,
especially in cold-start scenarios. Traditional collaborative filtering methods
do not work well for this kind of problem because these models rely on
interactions to update the latent embedding, which is hard to work in a
cold-start setting. We propose a new approach (DisCo), which relies on a
personalized Diffusion backbone, enhanced by disentangled aspects for the
user's interest, to generate a bundle in distribution space for each user to
tackle the cold-start challenge. During the training phase, DisCo adjusts an
additional objective loss term to avoid bias, a prevalent issue while using the
generative model for top-$K$ recommendation purposes. Our empirical experiments
show that DisCo outperforms five comparative baselines by a large margin on
three real-world datasets. Thereby, this study devises a promising framework
and essential viewpoints in cold-start recommendation. Our materials for

Result: 扩展后的CHAD框架保留了结构保持语义，并能够正确计算反向模式导数。

Conclusion: 该研究为部分语言中的反向模式AD提供了严格的范畴语义，并保证了其正确性。

Abstract: Combinatory Homomorphic Automatic Differentiation (CHAD) was originally
formulated as a semantics-driven source transformation for reverse-mode AD in
total programming languages. We extend this framework to partial languages with
features such as potentially non-terminating operations, real-valued
conditionals, and iteration constructs like while-loops, while preserving
CHAD's structure-preserving semantics principle. A key contribution is the
introduction of iteration-extensive indexed categories, which allow iteration
in the base category to lift to parameterized initial algebras in the indexed
category. This enables iteration to be interpreted in the Grothendieck
construction of the target language in a principled way. The resulting fibred
iterative structure cleanly models iteration in the categorical semantics.
Consequently, the extended CHAD transformation remains the unique
structure-preserving functor (an iterative Freyd category morphism) from the
freely generated iterative Freyd category of the source language to the
Grothendieck construction of the target's syntactic semantics, mapping each
primitive operation to its derivative. We prove the correctness of this
transformation using the universal property of the source language's syntax,
showing that the transformed programs compute correct reverse-mode derivatives.
Our development also contributes to understanding iteration constructs within
dependently typed languages and categories of containers. As our primary
motivation and application, we generalize CHAD to languages with data types,
partial features, and iteration, providing the first rigorous categorical
semantics for reverse-mode CHAD in such settings and formally guaranteeing the
correctness of the source-to-source CHAD technique.

Conclusion: 简单学习规则可有效缓解高密度群体的堵塞问题，为生物和机器人群体行为提供新假设。

Abstract: Social organisms which construct nests consisting of tunnels and chambers
necessarily navigate confined and crowded conditions. Unlike low-density
collectives like bird flocks and insect swarms, in which hydrodynamic and
statistical phenomena dominate, the physics of glasses and supercooled fluids
is important to understand clogging behaviors in high-density collectives. Our
previous work revealed that fire ants flowing in confined tunnels utilize
diverse behaviors like unequal workload distributions, spontaneous direction
reversals, and limited interaction times to mitigate clogging and jamming and
thus maintain functional flow; implementation of similar rules in a small
robophysical swarm led to high performance through spontaneous dissolution of
clogs and clusters. However, how the insects learn such behaviors, and how we
can develop "task capable" active matter in such regimes, remains a challenge
in part because interaction dynamics are dominated by local, time-consuming
collisions and no single agent can guide the entire collective. Here, we
hypothesized that effective flow and clog mitigation could emerge purely
through local learning. We tasked small groups of robots with pellet excavation
in a narrow tunnel, allowing them to modify reversal probabilities over time.
Initially, robots had equal probabilities and clogs were common. Reversals
improved flow. When reversal probabilities adapted via collisions and noisy
tunnel length estimates, workload inequality and performance improved. Our
robophysical study of an excavating swarm shows that, despite the seeming
complexity and difficulty of the task, simple learning rules can mitigate or
leverage unavoidable features in task-capable dense active matter, leading to
hypotheses for dense biological and robotic swarms.

Conclusion: EndoVLA为复杂动态解剖环境下的内窥镜手术提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In endoscopic procedures, autonomous tracking of abnormal regions and
following circumferential cutting markers can significantly reduce the
cognitive burden on endoscopists. However, conventional model-based pipelines
are fragile for each component (e.g., detection, motion planning) requires
manual tuning and struggles to incorporate high-level endoscopic intent,
leading to poor generalization across diverse scenes. Vision-Language-Action
(VLA) models, which integrate visual perception, language grounding, and motion
planning within an end-to-end framework, offer a promising alternative by
semantically adapting to surgeon prompts without manual recalibration. Despite
their potential, applying VLA models to robotic endoscopy presents unique
challenges due to the complex and dynamic anatomical environments of the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract. To address this, we introduce EndoVLA, designed
specifically for continuum robots in GI interventions. Given endoscopic images
and surgeon-issued tracking prompts, EndoVLA performs three core tasks: (1)
polyp tracking, (2) delineation and following of abnormal mucosal regions, and
(3) adherence to circular markers during circumferential cutting. To tackle
data scarcity and domain shifts, we propose a dual-phase strategy comprising
supervised fine-tuning on our EndoVLA-Motion dataset and reinforcement
fine-tuning with task-aware rewards. Our approach significantly improves
tracking performance in endoscopy and enables zero-shot generalization in
diverse scenes and complex sequential tasks.

Result: QC-SAC在模拟实验中实现了接近最优的驾驶策略，显著优于现有IL、RL和HL基线方法。

Conclusion: QC-SAC首次展示了安全自动驾驶中的过度转向控制和避障能力。

Abstract: Oversteer, wherein a vehicle's rear tires lose traction and induce
unintentional excessive yaw, poses critical safety challenges. Failing to
control oversteer often leads to severe traffic accidents. Although recent
autonomous driving efforts have attempted to handle oversteer through
stabilizing maneuvers, the majority rely on expert-defined trajectories or
assume obstacle-free environments, limiting real-world applicability. This
paper introduces a novel end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving approach that
tackles oversteer control and collision avoidance simultaneously. Existing E2E
techniques, including Imitation Learning (IL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and
Hybrid Learning (HL), generally require near-optimal demonstrations or
extensive experience. Yet even skilled human drivers struggle to provide
perfect demonstrations under oversteer, and high transition variance hinders
accumulating sufficient data. Hence, we present Q-Compared Soft Actor-Critic
(QC-SAC), a new HL algorithm that effectively learns from suboptimal
demonstration data and adapts rapidly to new conditions. To evaluate QC-SAC, we
introduce a benchmark inspired by real-world driver training: a vehicle
encounters sudden oversteer on a slippery surface and must avoid randomly
placed obstacles ahead. Experimental results show QC-SAC attains near-optimal
driving policies, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art IL, RL, and HL
baselines. Our method demonstrates the world's first safe autonomous oversteer
control with obstacle avoidance.

Abstract: Mesh reconstruction is a cornerstone process across various applications,
including in-silico trials, digital twins, surgical planning, and navigation.
Recent advancements in deep learning have notably enhanced mesh reconstruction
speeds. Yet, traditional methods predominantly rely on deforming a standardised
template mesh for individual subjects, which overlooks the unique anatomical
variations between them, and may compromise the fidelity of the
reconstructions. In this paper, we propose an adaptive-template-based mesh
reconstruction network (ATMRN), which generates adaptive templates from the
given images for the subsequent deformation, moving beyond the constraints of a
singular, fixed template. Our approach, validated on cortical magnetic
resonance (MR) images from the OASIS dataset, sets a new benchmark in
voxel-to-cortex mesh reconstruction, achieving an average symmetric surface
distance of 0.267mm across four cortical structures. Our proposed method is
generic and can be easily transferred to other image modalities and anatomical

Conclusion: SDLog是首个在软件日志匿名化中替代正则表达式方法的深度学习方案。

Abstract: Software logs are messages recorded during the execution of a software system
that provide crucial run-time information about events and activities. Although
software logs have a critical role in software maintenance and operation tasks,
publicly accessible log datasets remain limited, hindering advance in log
analysis research and practices. The presence of sensitive information,
particularly Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and quasi-identifiers,
introduces serious privacy and re-identification risks, discouraging the
publishing and sharing of real-world logs. In practice, log anonymization
techniques primarily rely on regular expression patterns, which involve
manually crafting rules to identify and replace sensitive information. However,
these regex-based approaches suffer from significant limitations, such as
extensive manual efforts and poor generalizability across diverse log formats
and datasets. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce SDLog, a deep
learning-based framework designed to identify sensitive information in software
logs. Our results show that SDLog overcomes regex limitations and outperforms
the best-performing regex patterns in identifying sensitive information. With
only 100 fine-tuning samples from the target dataset, SDLog can correctly
identify 99.5% of sensitive attributes and achieves an F1-score of 98.4%. To

Abstract: As robots are increasingly deployed to collaborate on tasks within shared
workspaces and resources, the failure of an individual robot can critically
affect the group's performance. This issue is particularly challenging when
robots lack global information or direct communication, relying instead on
social interaction for coordination and to complete their tasks. In this study,
we propose a novel fault-tolerance technique leveraging physical contact
interactions in multi-robot systems, specifically under conditions of limited
sensing and spatial confinement. We introduce the "Active Contact Response"
(ACR) method, where each robot modulates its behavior based on the likelihood
of encountering an inoperative (faulty) robot. Active robots are capable of
collectively repositioning stationary and faulty peers to reduce obstructions
and maintain optimal group functionality. We implement our algorithm in a team
of autonomous robots, equipped with contact-sensing and collision-tolerance
capabilities, tasked with collectively excavating cohesive model pellets.
Experimental results indicate that the ACR method significantly improves the
system's recovery time from robot failures, enabling continued collective
excavation with minimal performance degradation. Thus, this work demonstrates
the potential of leveraging local, social, and physical interactions to enhance
fault tolerance and coordination in multi-robot systems operating in
constrained and extreme environments.

Abstract: Soccer is a sport played on a pitch where effective use of space is crucial.
Decision-making during transitions, when possession switches between teams, has
been increasingly important, but research on space evaluation in these moments
has been limited. Recent space evaluation methods such as OBSO (Off-Ball
Scoring Opportunity) use scoring probability, so it is not well-suited for
assessing areas far from the goal, where transitions typically occur. In this
paper, we propose OBPV (Off-Ball Positioning Value) to evaluate space across
the pitch, including the starting points of transitions. OBPV extends OBSO by
introducing the field value model, which evaluates the entire pitch, and by
employing the transition kernel model, which reflects positional specificity
through kernel density estimation of pass distributions. Experiments using La

space utilization during counter-attacks and reveals team-specific

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are serious cerebrovascular lesions found in

mortality. Current methods for assessing IA risk focus on morphological and
patient-specific factors, but the hemodynamic influences on IA development and

10,660 3D shapes via controlled deformation to simulate aneurysm evolution. The
authenticity of these synthetic shapes was confirmed by neurosurgeons. CFD

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于气流惯性的里程计系统，通过多传感器数据融合（包括热风速计、IMU、ESC和气压计）来估计飞行器状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低成本IMU和气压计存在显著偏差，而风速计测量易受螺旋桨旋转和地面效应的干扰，因此需要一种方法来准确估计飞行速度。

Method: 采用GRU神经网络从噪声干扰的风速计数据中估计相对风速，并结合带有偏差模型的观测器融合传感器数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效解耦螺旋桨下洗气流和地面效应引起的风速干扰，在无风室内环境中准确估计飞行速度，位置积分漂移仅为5.7米（203秒随机飞行）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了传感器偏差对状态估计的影响，提高了飞行速度估计的准确性。

Abstract: This work demonstrates an airflow inertial based odometry system with
multi-sensor data fusion, including thermal anemometer, IMU, ESC, and
barometer. This goal is challenging because low-cost IMUs and barometers have
significant bias, and anemometer measurements are very susceptible to
interference from spinning propellers and ground effects. We employ a GRU-based
deep neural network to estimate relative air speed from noisy and disturbed
anemometer measurements, and an observer with bias model to fuse the sensor
data and thus estimate the state of aerial vehicle. A complete flight data,
including takeoff and landing on the ground, shows that the approach is able to
decouple the downwash induced wind speed caused by propellers and the ground
effect, and accurately estimate the flight speed in a wind-free indoor
environment. IMU, and barometer bias are effectively estimated, which
significantly reduces the position integration drift, which is only 5.7m for
203s manual random flight. The open source is available on

Result: 在OPT、LLaMA-2和3等模型上实现2.2倍加速，且不损失精度。

Conclusion: Polar Sparsity首次证明上下文稀疏性可扩展至大批量，适用于高吞吐LLM部署。

Abstract: Accelerating large language model (LLM) inference is critical for real-world
deployments requiring high throughput and low latency. Contextual sparsity,
where each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model
parameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union
of active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar
Sparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention
layers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more
compute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast,
attention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head
sparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop hardware-efficient,
sparsity-aware GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations,
delivering up to \(2.2\times\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2
\& 3, across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising
accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that
contextual sparsity can scale effectively to large batch sizes, delivering
substantial inference acceleration with minimal changes, making Polar Sparsity
practical for large-scale, high-throughput LLM deployment systems. Our code is

Motivation: 当前基于RL的后训练方法使用固定或监督微调的验证器，容易受到奖励攻击且泛化能力有限。

Result: Tango在多个数学推理任务中表现最佳，验证器在ProcessBench上领先。

Conclusion: Tango的生成式RL验证器提高了鲁棒性和泛化能力，与生成器相互促进。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a compelling approach for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), where an
LLM generator serves as a policy guided by a verifier (reward model). However,
current RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are
fixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking
and generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently
train both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central
innovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is
trained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is
trained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without
requiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained
verifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to
deterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual
reinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both
components of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models:
the generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level
math benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the
verifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset. Remarkably, both components exhibit
particularly substantial improvements on the most difficult mathematical
reasoning problems. Code is at: https://github.com/kaiwenzha/rl-tango.

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM的理论基础与实际行为之间架起桥梁，兼具解释力和实用价值。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) calls for a rigorous
theoretical framework to explain their empirical success. While significant
progress has been made in understanding LLM behaviors, existing theoretical
frameworks remain fragmented in explaining emergent phenomena through a unified
mathematical lens. We establish the first formal connection between LLM
architectures and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) by proving two
fundamental results: (1) the training process computationally approximates
Solomonoff prior through loss minimization interpreted as program length
optimization, and (2) next-token prediction implements approximate Solomonoff
induction. We leverage AIT to provide a unified theoretical explanation for
in-context learning, few-shot learning, and scaling laws. Furthermore, our
theoretical insights lead to a principled method for few-shot example selection
that prioritizes samples where models exhibit lower predictive confidence. We
demonstrate through experiments on diverse text classification benchmarks that
this strategy yields significant performance improvements, particularly for
smaller model architectures, when compared to selecting high-confidence
examples. Our framework bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and
practical LLM behaviors, providing both explanatory power and actionable
insights for future model development.

Abstract: Scaling large language models (LLMs) has driven significant advancements, yet
it faces diminishing returns and escalating energy demands. This work
introduces test-time compute (TTC)-allocating additional computational
resources during inference-as a compelling complement to conventional scaling
strategies. Specifically, we investigate whether employing TTC can achieve
superior accuracy-energy trade-offs compared to simply increasing model size.
Our empirical analysis reveals that TTC surpasses traditional model scaling in
accuracy/energy efficiency, with notable gains in tasks demanding complex
reasoning rather than mere factual recall. Further, we identify a critical
interaction between TTC performance and output sequence length, demonstrating
that strategically adjusting compute resources at inference time according to
query complexity can substantially enhance efficiency. Our findings advocate
for TTC as a promising direction, enabling more sustainable, accurate, and
adaptable deployment of future language models without incurring additional

Conclusion: Quaff在效率、性能和可部署性之间取得了平衡，为个性化LLM部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made exciting achievements across various
domains, yet their deployment on resource-constrained personal devices remains
hindered by the prohibitive computational and memory demands of task-specific
fine-tuning. While quantization offers a pathway to efficiency, existing
methods struggle to balance performance and overhead, either incurring high
computational/memory costs or failing to address activation outliers, a
critical bottleneck in quantized fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we
propose the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (OSSH): During fine-tuning,
certain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions across
training iterations. Building on OSSH, we propose Quaff, a Quantized
parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs, optimizing low-precision
activation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically
suppresses outliers exclusively in invariant channels using lightweight
operations, eliminating full-precision weight storage and global rescaling
while reducing quantization errors. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks
validate OSSH and demonstrate Quaff's efficacy. Specifically, on the GPQA
reasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves a 1.73x latency reduction and 30% memory
savings over full-precision fine-tuning while improving accuracy by 0.6% on the
Phi-3 model, reconciling the triple trade-off between efficiency, performance,
and deployability. By enabling consumer-grade GPU fine-tuning (e.g., RTX 2080
Super) without sacrificing model utility, Quaff democratizes personalized LLM
deployment. The code is available at https://github.com/Little0o0/Quaff.git.

Conclusion: LLMSynthor为经济学、社会科学等领域提供了一种高效的数据合成工具。

Abstract: Generating synthetic data that faithfully captures the statistical structure
of real-world distributions is a fundamental challenge in data modeling.
Classical approaches often depend on strong parametric assumptions or manual
structural design and struggle in high-dimensional or heterogeneous domains.
Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) reveals their potential as
flexible, high-dimensional priors over real-world distributions. However, when
applied to data synthesis, standard LLM-based sampling is inefficient,
constrained by fixed context limits, and fails to ensure statistical alignment.
Given this, we introduce LLMSynthor, a general framework for data synthesis
that transforms LLMs into structure-aware simulators guided by distributional
feedback. LLMSynthor treats the LLM as a nonparametric copula simulator for
modeling high-order dependencies and introduces LLM Proposal Sampling to
generate grounded proposal distributions that improve sampling efficiency
without requiring rejection. By minimizing discrepancies in the summary
statistics space, the iterative synthesis loop aligns real and synthetic data
while gradually uncovering and refining the latent generative structure. We
evaluate LLMSynthor in both controlled and real-world settings using
heterogeneous datasets in privacy-sensitive domains (e.g., e-commerce,
population, and mobility) that encompass both structured and unstructured
formats. The synthetic data produced by LLMSynthor shows high statistical
fidelity, practical utility, and cross-data adaptability, positioning it as a
valuable tool across economics, social science, urban studies, and beyond.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach to adapting large
language models (LLMs) to new domains. In this work, we improve the statistical
efficiency of SFT by selecting an informative subset of training examples.
Specifically, for a fixed budget of training examples, which determines the
computational cost of fine-tuning, we determine the most informative ones. The
key idea in our method is to select examples that maximize information gain,
measured by the Hessian of the log-likelihood of the LLM. We approximate it
efficiently by linearizing the LLM at the last layer using multinomial logistic
regression models. Our approach is computationally efficient, analyzable, and
performs well empirically. We demonstrate this on several problems, and back
our claims with both quantitative results and an LLM evaluation.

Conclusion: 论文解决了高效Attention计算的理论问题，为LLM训练提供了新的可能性，但也指出了进一步优化的理论限制。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Transformer architecture, the standard
algorithm for computing Attention suffers from quadratic time complexity in
context length $n$. Alman and Song [NeurIPS 2023] showed that when the head
dimension $d = \Theta(\log n)$, subquadratic Attention is possible if and only
if the inputs have small entries bounded by $B = o(\sqrt{\log n})$ in absolute
values, under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis ($\mathsf{SETH}$).
Equivalently, subquadratic Attention is possible if and only if the softmax is
applied with high temperature for $d=\Theta(\log n)$. Running times of these
algorithms depend exponentially on $B$ and thus they do not lead to even a
polynomial-time algorithm outside the specific range of $B$.
  This naturally leads to the question: when can Attention be computed
efficiently without strong assumptions on temperature? Are there fast attention
algorithms that scale polylogarithmically with entry size $B$? In this work, we
resolve this question and characterize when fast Attention for arbitrary
temperatures is possible. First, for all constant $d = O(1)$, we give the first
subquadratic $\tilde{O}(n^{2 - 1/d} \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(B))$ time algorithm
for Attention with large $B$. Our result holds even for matrices with large
head dimension if they have low rank. In this regime, we also give a similar
running time for Attention gradient computation, and therefore for the full LLM
training process. Furthermore, we show that any substantial improvement on our
algorithm is unlikely. In particular, we show that even when $d =
2^{\Theta(\log^* n)}$, Attention requires $n^{2 - o(1)}$ time under
$\mathsf{SETH}$.
  Finally, in the regime where $d = \mathrm{poly}(n)$, we show that the
standard algorithm is optimal under popular fine-grained complexity
assumptions.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning models in open-world
deployment is a central challenge in AI safety. This thesis develops both
algorithmic and theoretical foundations to address key reliability issues
arising from distributional uncertainty and unknown classes, from standard
neural networks to modern foundation models like large language models (LLMs).
  Traditional learning paradigms, such as empirical risk minimization (ERM),
assume no distribution shift between training and inference, often leading to
overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This thesis
introduces novel frameworks that jointly optimize for in-distribution accuracy
and reliability to unseen data. A core contribution is the development of an
unknown-aware learning framework that enables models to recognize and handle
novel inputs without labeled OOD data.
  We propose new outlier synthesis methods, VOS, NPOS, and DREAM-OOD, to
generate informative unknowns during training. Building on this, we present
SAL, a theoretical and algorithmic framework that leverages unlabeled
in-the-wild data to enhance OOD detection under realistic deployment
conditions. These methods demonstrate that abundant unlabeled data can be
harnessed to recognize and adapt to unforeseen inputs, providing formal
reliability guarantees.
  The thesis also extends reliable learning to foundation models. We develop
HaloScope for hallucination detection in LLMs, MLLMGuard for defending against
malicious prompts in multimodal models, and data cleaning methods to denoise
human feedback used for better alignment. These tools target failure modes that
threaten the safety of large-scale models in deployment.
  Overall, these contributions promote unknown-aware learning as a new
paradigm, and we hope it can advance the reliability of AI systems with minimal
human efforts.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a technique to leverage hardware concurrency to
improve the efficiency of large-scale autoregressive (AR) Transformer models by
enabling multiple steps of token generation in a single forward pass.
State-space models (SSMs) are already more efficient than AR Transformers,
since their state summarizes all past data with no need to cache or re-process
tokens in the sliding window context. However, their state can also comprise
thousands of tokens; so, speculative decoding has recently been extended to
SSMs. Existing approaches, however, do not leverage the tree-based verification
methods, since current SSMs lack the means to compute a token tree efficiently.
We propose the first scalable algorithm to perform tree-based speculative
decoding in state-space models (SSMs) and hybrid architectures of SSMs and
Transformer layers. We exploit the structure of accumulated state transition
matrices to facilitate tree-based speculative decoding with minimal overhead to
current SSM state update implementations. With the algorithm, we describe a
hardware-aware implementation that improves naive application of AR Transformer
tree-based speculative decoding methods to SSMs. Furthermore, we outperform
vanilla speculative decoding with SSMs even with a baseline drafting model and
tree structure on three different benchmarks, opening up opportunities for
further speed up with SSM and hybrid model inference. Code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language
Models (LLMs), often requiring robust multi step logical consistency. While
Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting elicits reasoning steps, it doesn't guarantee
correctness, and improving reliability via extensive sampling is
computationally costly. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model
(EORM), an effective, lightweight, post hoc verifier. EORM leverages Energy
Based Models (EBMs) to simplify the training of reward models by learning to
assign a scalar energy score to CoT solutions using only outcome labels,
thereby avoiding detailed annotations. It achieves this by interpreting
discriminator output logits as negative energies, effectively ranking
candidates where lower energy is assigned to solutions leading to correct final
outcomes implicitly favoring coherent reasoning. On mathematical benchmarks
(GSM8k, MATH), EORM significantly improves final answer accuracy (e.g., with
Llama 3 8B, achieving 90.7% on GSM8k and 63.7% on MATH). EORM effectively
leverages a given pool of candidate solutions to match or exceed the
performance of brute force sampling, thereby enhancing LLM reasoning outcome
reliability through its streamlined post hoc verification process.

generalization abilities were known. Our work addresses these gaps by showing
that there exists a class of one-layer transformers that are provably
Bayes-optimal with both linear and ReLU attention. When being trained with
gradient descent, we show via a finite-sample analysis that the expected loss
of these transformers converges at linear rate to the Bayes risk. Moreover, we
prove that the trained models generalize to unseen samples as well as exhibit
learning behaviors that were empirically observed in previous works. Our

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices,
driven by model advancements and hardware improvements, offers significant
privacy benefits. However, these on-device LLMs inherently face performance
limitations due to reduced model capacity and necessary compression techniques.
To address this, we introduce a systematic methodology -- encompassing model
capability, development efficiency, and system resources -- for evaluating
on-device LLMs. Our comprehensive evaluation, encompassing models from 0.5B to
14B parameters and seven post-training quantization (PTQ) methods on commodity
laptops, yields several critical insights: 1) System-level metrics exhibit
near-linear scaling with effective bits-per-weight (BPW). 2) A practical
threshold exists around $\sim$3.5 effective BPW, larger models subjected to
low-bit quantization consistently outperform smaller models utilizing higher
bit-precision. 3) Quantization with low BPW incurs marginal accuracy loss but
significant memory savings. 4) Determined by low-level implementation specifics
power consumption on CPU, where computation-intensive operations spend more
power than memory-intensive ones. These findings offer crucial insights and
practical guidelines for the efficient deployment and optimized configuration
of LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices. Our codebase is available at

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate
remarkable potential for scientific discovery. Existing approaches, however,
often automate scientific discovery using predefined workflows that lack
rationality constraints. This often leads to aimless hypothesizing and a
failure to consistently link hypotheses with evidence, thereby hindering
systematic uncertainty reduction. Overcoming these limitations fundamentally
requires systematic uncertainty reduction. We introduce \texttt{PiFlow}, an
information-theoretical framework, treating automated scientific discovery as a
structured uncertainty reduction problem guided by principles (e.g., scientific
laws). In evaluations across three distinct scientific domains -- discovering
nanomaterial structures, bio-molecules, and superconductor candidates with
targeted properties -- our method significantly improves discovery efficiency,
reflected by a 73.55\% increase in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of property
values versus exploration steps, and enhances solution quality by 94.06\%
compared to a vanilla agent system. Overall, \texttt{PiFlow} serves as a
Plug-and-Play method, establishing a novel paradigm shift in highly efficient
automated scientific discovery, paving the way for more robust and accelerated
AI-driven research. Code is publicly available at our

Result: 实验表明，剪裁99%的梯度流仅增加1%的梯度方差，适用于长序列训练。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效减少反向传播计算量，适用于长序列Transformer训练。

Abstract: It is straightforward to design an unbiased gradient estimator that
stochastically cuts the backpropagation flow through any part of a
computational graph. By cutting the parts that have little effect on the
computation, one can potentially save a significant amount of back-propagation
computation in exchange for a minimal increase in the stochastic gradient
variance, in some situations. Such a situation occurs in the attention
mechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention
becomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically
with sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very
small, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small
fraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising
targets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule
controlled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts backpropagation through most
attention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention
head. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the
attention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear
complexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical
transformer model, cutting $99\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing
$c \sim 20-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about
$1\%$ for $n \sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$. This approach is amenable
to efficient sparse matrix implementation, thus being promising for making the
cost of a backward pass negligible relative to the cost of a forward pass when
training a transformer model on long sequences.

Conclusion: CaMVo是一种实用且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于动态标注环境。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automated
dataset labeling with minimal human supervision. While majority voting across
multiple LLMs can improve label reliability by mitigating individual model
biases, it incurs high computational costs due to repeated querying. In this
work, we propose a novel online framework, Cost-aware Majority Voting (CaMVo),
for efficient and accurate LLM-based dataset annotation. CaMVo adaptively
selects a subset of LLMs for each data instance based on contextual embeddings,
balancing confidence and cost without requiring pre-training or ground-truth
labels. Leveraging a LinUCB-based selection mechanism and a Bayesian estimator
over confidence scores, CaMVo estimates a lower bound on labeling accuracy for
each LLM and aggregates responses through weighted majority voting. Our
empirical evaluation on the MMLU and IMDB Movie Review datasets demonstrates
that CaMVo achieves comparable or superior accuracy to full majority voting
while significantly reducing labeling costs. This establishes CaMVo as a
practical and robust solution for cost-efficient annotation in dynamic labeling
environments.

Method: 提出三种熵最小化方法：1) EM-FT（类似指令微调但无监督）；2) EM-RL（仅以负熵为奖励的强化学习）；3) EM-INF（无需训练数据的推理时调整）。

Result: EM-RL在Qwen-7B上表现优于有监督RL基线；EM-INF使Qwen-32B在SciCode基准上媲美GPT-4o等专有模型，效率更高。

Conclusion: 熵最小化可有效激发LLM的潜在能力，无需标注数据或参数更新。

Abstract: Entropy minimization (EM) trains the model to concentrate even more
probability mass on its most confident outputs. We show that this simple
objective alone, without any labeled data, can substantially improve large
language models' (LLMs) performance on challenging math, physics, and coding
tasks. We explore three approaches: (1) EM-FT minimizes token-level entropy
similarly to instruction finetuning, but on unlabeled outputs drawn from the
model; (2) EM-RL: reinforcement learning with negative entropy as the only
reward to maximize; (3) EM-INF: inference-time logit adjustment to reduce
entropy without any training data or parameter updates. On Qwen-7B, EM-RL,
without any labeled data, achieves comparable or better performance than strong
RL baselines such as GRPO and RLOO that are trained on 60K labeled examples.
Furthermore, EM-INF enables Qwen-32B to match or exceed the performance of
proprietary models like GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5 Pro on the
challenging SciCode benchmark, while being 3x more efficient than
self-consistency and sequential refinement. Our findings reveal that many
pretrained LLMs possess previously underappreciated reasoning capabilities that
can be effectively elicited through entropy minimization alone, without any
labeled data or even any parameter updates.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a popular method to accelerate the
inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) while retaining their superior text
generation performance. Previous methods either adopt a fixed speculative
decoding configuration regardless of the prefix tokens, or train draft models
in an offline or online manner to align them with the context. This paper
proposes a training-free online learning framework to adaptively choose the
configuration of the hyperparameters for speculative decoding as text is being
generated. We first formulate this hyperparameter selection problem as a
Multi-Armed Bandit problem and provide a general speculative decoding framework
BanditSpec. Furthermore, two bandit-based hyperparameter selection algorithms,
UCBSpec and EXP3Spec, are designed and analyzed in terms of a novel quantity,
the stopping time regret. We upper bound this regret under both stochastic and
adversarial reward settings. By deriving an information-theoretic impossibility
result, it is shown that the regret performance of UCBSpec is optimal up to
universal constants. Finally, extensive empirical experiments with LLaMA3 and
Qwen2 demonstrate that our algorithms are effective compared to existing
methods, and the throughput is close to the oracle best hyperparameter in
simulated real-life LLM serving scenarios with diverse input prompts.

Conclusion: LHF是一种简单有效的方法，能够通过数据集预处理提升ICRL性能，尤其在噪声数据下表现突出。

Abstract: Transformer models (TMs) have exhibited remarkable in-context reinforcement
learning (ICRL) capabilities, allowing them to generalize to and improve in
previously unseen environments without re-training or fine-tuning. This is
typically accomplished by imitating the complete learning histories of a source
RL algorithm over a substantial amount of pretraining environments, which,
however, may transfer suboptimal behaviors inherited from the source
algorithm/dataset. Therefore, in this work, we address the issue of inheriting
suboptimality from the perspective of dataset preprocessing. Motivated by the
success of the weighted empirical risk minimization, we propose a simple yet
effective approach, learning history filtering (LHF), to enhance ICRL by
reweighting and filtering the learning histories based on their improvement and
stability characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, LHF is the first
approach to avoid source suboptimality by dataset preprocessing, and can be
combined with the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) ICRL algorithms. We
substantiate the effectiveness of LHF through a series of experiments conducted
on the well-known ICRL benchmarks, encompassing both discrete environments and
continuous robotic manipulation tasks, with three SOTA ICRL algorithms (AD,
DPT, DICP) as the backbones. LHF exhibits robust performance across a variety
of suboptimal scenarios, as well as under varying hyperparameters and sampling
strategies. Notably, the superior performance of LHF becomes more pronounced in
the presence of noisy data, indicating the significance of filtering learning
histories.

Conclusion: PKPO通过优化样本集的联合效用，提升了探索能力和任务解决能力，尤其在复杂任务中效果显著。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms sample multiple n>1 solution attempts
for each problem and reward them independently. This optimizes for pass@1
performance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of
the diversity and collective utility of sets of samples. This under-utilizes
the sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder
examples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO), a
transformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of
pass@k performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward
when considered jointly. Our contribution is to derive novel low variance
unbiased estimators for pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and
continuous reward settings. We show optimization with our estimators reduces to
standard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and
efficient transformation function.
  While previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable
robust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k <= n. Moreover, instead of
trading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k
during training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1
numbers alongside significant pass@k gains.
  We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the
variance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world
examples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation
effectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable
solving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and
pass@k . Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1
optimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely due to
better exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual
samples.

Abstract: Deep learning has seen widespread success in various domains such as science,
industry, and society. However, it is acknowledged that certain approaches
suffer from non-robustness, relying on spurious correlations for predictions.
Addressing these limitations is of paramount importance, necessitating the
development of methods that can disentangle spurious correlations. {This study
attempts to implement causal models via logit perturbations and introduces a
novel Causal Logit Perturbation (CLP) framework to train classifiers with
generated causal logit perturbations for individual samples, thereby mitigating
the spurious associations between non-causal attributes (i.e., image
backgrounds) and classes.} {Our framework employs a} perturbation network to
generate sample-wise logit perturbations using a series of training
characteristics of samples as inputs. The whole framework is optimized by an
online meta-learning-based learning algorithm and leverages human causal
knowledge by augmenting metadata in both counterfactual and factual manners.
Empirical evaluations on four typical biased learning scenarios, including
long-tail learning, noisy label learning, generalized long-tail learning, and
subpopulation shift learning, demonstrate that CLP consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, visualization results support the
effectiveness of the generated causal perturbations in redirecting model
attention towards causal image attributes and dismantling spurious

Conclusion: μP为扩散Transformer的规模化提供了一种高效且可靠的框架。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative
models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter
(HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P)
was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from
small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However,
it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion
Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we
generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its
effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that
$\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT,
PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer,
enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging
this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP
transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate
achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling
PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases,
models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small
tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of
consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a
principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.

Abstract: Policy exploration is critical in reinforcement learning (RL), where existing
approaches include greedy, Gaussian process, etc. However, these approaches
utilize preset stochastic processes and are indiscriminately applied in all
kinds of RL tasks without considering task-specific features that influence
policy exploration. Moreover, during RL training, the evolution of such
stochastic processes is rigid, which typically only incorporates a decay in the
variance, failing to adjust flexibly according to the agent's real-time
learning status. Inspired by the analyzing and reasoning capability of large
language models (LLMs), we design LLM-Explorer to adaptively generate
task-specific exploration strategies with LLMs, enhancing the policy
exploration in RL. In our design, we sample the learning trajectory of the
agent during the RL training in a given task and prompt the LLM to analyze the
agent's current policy learning status and then generate a probability
distribution for future policy exploration. Updating the probability
distribution periodically, we derive a stochastic process specialized for the
particular task and dynamically adjusted to adapt to the learning process. Our
design is a plug-in module compatible with various widely applied RL
algorithms, including the DQN series, DDPG, TD3, and any possible variants
developed based on them. Through extensive experiments on the Atari and MuJoCo

Abstract: Model ensemble is a useful approach in reinforcement learning (RL) for
training effective agents. Despite wide success of RL, training effective
agents remains difficult due to the multitude of factors requiring careful
tuning, such as algorithm selection, hyperparameter settings, and even random
seed choices, all of which can significantly influence an agent's performance.
Model ensemble helps overcome this challenge by combining multiple weak agents
into a single, more powerful one, enhancing overall performance. However,
existing ensemble methods, such as majority voting and Boltzmann addition, are
designed as fixed strategies and lack a semantic understanding of specific
tasks, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness. To address this, we
propose LLM-Ens, a novel approach that enhances RL model ensemble with
task-specific semantic understandings driven by large language models (LLMs).
Given a task, we first design an LLM to categorize states in this task into
distinct 'situations', incorporating high-level descriptions of the task
conditions. Then, we statistically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each
individual agent to be used in the ensemble in each situation. During the
inference time, LLM-Ens dynamically identifies the changing task situation and
switches to the agent that performs best in the current situation, ensuring
dynamic model selection in the evolving task condition. Our approach is
designed to be compatible with agents trained with different random seeds,
hyperparameter settings, and various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments on
the Atari benchmark show that LLM-Ens significantly improves the RL model
ensemble, surpassing well-known baselines by up to 20.9%. For reproducibility,

Result: 实验表明，TBRM在数学推理基准测试中优于PPO和GRPO等基于策略的方法，且计算和内存开销更低。

Conclusion: 基于价值的RL可能是增强LLM推理能力的更高效和原则性方法。

Abstract: Policy-based methods currently dominate reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines
for large language model (LLM) reasoning, leaving value-based approaches
largely unexplored. We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual
Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an
algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet
effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman
objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for
critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one
rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized
policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved
change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard
mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms
policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower
computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL
might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning
capabilities in LLMs.

Motivation: 解决多步数学推理中LLM的高计算开销问题，特别是并行解码的效率与准确性权衡。

Method: 提出SSR框架，结合选择性并行模块（SPM）和步骤级推测解码（SSD），实现训练免费的高效推理加速。

Result: 在三个数学基准测试中，SSR显著提升效率（如LiveMathBench提升13.84%准确率，计算量降至80.5%），且MATH-500计算量降至30%无精度损失。

Conclusion: SSR有效平衡了多步推理的效率与准确性，为LLM推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on multi-step
mathematical reasoning, yet at the cost of high computational overhead. This
challenge is particularly acute for test-time scaling methods such as parallel
decoding, which increase answer diversity but scale poorly in efficiency. To
address this efficiency-accuracy trade-off, we propose SSR (Speculative
Parallel Scaling Reasoning), a training-free framework that leverages a key
insight: by introducing speculative decoding at the step level, we can
accelerate reasoning without sacrificing correctness. SSR integrates two
components: a Selective Parallel Module (SPM) that identifies a small set of
promising reasoning strategies via model-internal scoring, and Step-level
Speculative Decoding (SSD), which enables efficient draft-target collaboration
for fine-grained reasoning acceleration. Experiments on three mathematical
benchmarks-AIME 2024, MATH-500, and LiveMathBench - demonstrate that SSR
achieves strong gains over baselines. For instance, on LiveMathBench, SSR
improves pass@1 accuracy by 13.84% while reducing computation to 80.5% of the
baseline FLOPs. On MATH-500, SSR reduces compute to only 30% with no loss in
accuracy.

Result: Set-LLM训练有效，性能与原模型相当或更好，同时消除了顺序敏感性。

Conclusion: Set-LLM为LLM的鲁棒性提供了实用解决方案，适用于需要排列不变性的场景。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across
numerous applications, their robustness remains a critical concern. This paper
is motivated by a specific vulnerability: the order sensitivity of LLMs. This
vulnerability manifests itself as the order bias observed when LLMs decide
between possible options (for example, a preference for the first option) and
the tendency of LLMs to provide different answers when options are reordered.
The use cases for this scenario extend beyond the classical case of
multiple-choice question answering to the use of LLMs as automated evaluators
in AI pipelines, comparing output generated by different models. We introduce
Set-LLM, a novel architectural adaptation for pretrained LLMs that enables the
processing of mixed set-text inputs with permutation invariance guarantees. The
adaptations involve a new attention mask and new positional encodings
specifically designed for sets. We provide a theoretical proof of invariance
and demonstrate through experiments that Set-LLM can be trained effectively,
achieving comparable or improved performance and maintaining the runtime of the
original model, while eliminating order sensitivity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自注意力机制在捕捉短程依赖时存在局限性，导致训练不稳定（如损失值突增或发散）。

Method: 将自注意力分解为局部（短程）和全局（长程）注意力头（LS-attention），以缓解对数爆炸问题。

Result: LS-attention显著降低了验证困惑度（降至其他方法的2/5），并减少了GPU计算时间（仅为其他方法的1/20），同时推理延迟降低了36%。

Conclusion: LS-attention是一种高效且稳定的自注意力替代方案，适用于Transformer模型的训练和推理。

Abstract: Transformer language models have driven significant progress across various
fields, including natural language processing and computer vision. A central
component of these models is the self-attention (SA) mechanism, which learns
rich vector representations of tokens by modeling their relationships with
others in a sequence. However, despite extensive research, transformers
continue to suffer from training instability -- often manifesting as spikes or
divergence in the training loss during a run.
  In this work, we identify one source of this instability: SA's limited
ability to capture short-range dependencies, especially in tasks like language
modeling, where almost every token heavily relies on its nearby neighbors. This
limitation causes the pre-softmax logits of SA to grow rapidly, destabilizing
training. To address this, we propose decomposing the SA into local
(short-range) and global (long-range) attention heads. This decomposed
attention, referred to as Long Short-attention (LS-attention), mitigates logit
explosion and results in more stable training compared to an equivalent
multi-head self-attention (MHSA). Empirical comparisons with two alternative
training stabilization methods show that LS-attention reduces the validation
perplexity to nearly 2/5 of that achieved by one method and reaches a similar
perplexity as the other method using only 1/20 of the GPU hours. Additionally,
our experiments demonstrate that LS-attention reduces inference latency by up
to 36% compared to a state-of-the-art implementation of equivalent MHSA.

Result: 高噪声设置导致性能下降高达57%，低噪声设置无法抵御所有攻击类型。还提出了一种针对扩散过程的新型攻击策略。

Conclusion: 对抗鲁棒性与性能之间的权衡仍需解决。

Abstract: While foundation models demonstrate impressive performance across various
tasks, they remain vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Current research explores
various approaches to enhance model robustness, with Diffusion Denoised
Smoothing emerging as a particularly promising technique. This method employs a
pretrained diffusion model to preprocess inputs before model inference. Yet,
its effectiveness remains largely unexplored beyond classification. We aim to
address this gap by analyzing three datasets with four distinct downstream
tasks under three different adversarial attack algorithms. Our findings reveal
that while foundation models maintain resilience against conventional
transformations, applying high-noise diffusion denoising to clean images
without any distortions significantly degrades performance by as high as 57%.
Low-noise diffusion settings preserve performance but fail to provide adequate
protection across all attack types. Moreover, we introduce a novel attack
strategy specifically targeting the diffusion process itself, capable of
circumventing defenses in the low-noise regime. Our results suggest that the
trade-off between adversarial robustness and performance remains a challenge to
be addressed.

Conclusion: 嵌入层的动态更新和双线性耦合是“grokking”现象的关键机制，优化方法可加速收敛并提升训练效率。

Abstract: Grokking, a delayed generalization in neural networks after perfect training
performance, has been observed in Transformers and MLPs, but the components
driving it remain underexplored. We show that embeddings are central to
grokking: introducing them into MLPs induces delayed generalization in modular
arithmetic tasks, whereas MLPs without embeddings can generalize immediately.
Our analysis identifies two key mechanisms: (1) Embedding update dynamics,
where rare tokens stagnate due to sparse gradient updates and weight decay, and
(2) Bilinear coupling, where the interaction between embeddings and downstream
weights introduces saddle points and increases sensitivity to initialization.
To confirm these mechanisms, we investigate frequency-aware sampling, which
balances token updates by minimizing gradient variance, and embedding-specific
learning rates, derived from the asymmetric curvature of the bilinear loss
landscape. We prove that an adaptive learning rate ratio,
\(\frac{\eta_E}{\eta_W} \propto \frac{\sigma_{\max}(E)}{\sigma_{\max}(W)} \cdot
\frac{f_W}{f_E}\), mitigates bilinear coupling effects, accelerating
convergence. Our methods not only improve grokking dynamics but also extend to
broader challenges in Transformer optimization, where bilinear interactions
hinder efficient training.

Abstract: Machine learning explainability aims to make the decision-making process of
black-box models more transparent by finding the most important input features
for a given prediction task. Recent works have proposed composing explanations
from semantic concepts (e.g., colors, patterns, shapes) that are inherently
interpretable to the user of a model. However, these methods generally ignore
the communicative context of explanation-the ability of the user to understand
the prediction of the model from the explanation. For example, while a medical
doctor might understand an explanation in terms of clinical markers, a patient
may need a more accessible explanation to make sense of the same diagnosis. In
this paper, we address this gap with listener-adaptive explanations. We propose
an iterative procedure grounded in principles of pragmatic reasoning and the
rational speech act to generate explanations that maximize communicative
utility. Our procedure only needs access to pairwise preferences between
candidate explanations, relevant in real-world scenarios where a listener model
may not be available. We evaluate our method in image classification tasks,
demonstrating improved alignment between explanations and listener preferences
across three datasets. Furthermore, we perform a user study that demonstrates
our explanations increase communicative utility.

Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate the effects of noisy labels in
offline alignment, with a focus on the interplay between privacy and robustness
against adversarial corruption. Specifically, under linear modeling
assumptions, we present a unified analysis covering both reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) under
different privacy-corruption scenarios, such as Local differential
privacy-then-Corruption (LTC), where human preference labels are privatized
before being corrupted by an adversary, and Corruption-then-Local differential
privacy (CTL), where labels are corrupted before privacy protection. Our
analysis leverages a reduction framework that reduces the offline alignment
problem under linear modeling assumptions to parameter estimation in logistic
regression. This framework allows us to establish an interesting separation
result between LTC and CTL, demonstrating that LTC presents a greater challenge
than CTL in offline alignment, even under linear models. As important
by-products, our findings also advance the state-of-the-art theoretical results
in offline alignment under privacy-only or corruption-only scenarios.

Abstract: This work aims to demystify the out-of-distribution (OOD) capabilities of
in-context learning (ICL) by studying linear regression tasks parameterized
with low-rank covariance matrices. With such a parameterization, we can model
distribution shifts as a varying angle between the subspace of the training and
testing covariance matrices. We prove that a single-layer linear attention
model incurs a test risk with a non-negligible dependence on the angle,
illustrating that ICL is not robust to such distribution shifts. However, using
this framework, we also prove an interesting property of ICL: when trained on
task vectors drawn from a union of low-dimensional subspaces, ICL can
generalize to any subspace within their span, given sufficiently long prompt
lengths. This suggests that the OOD generalization ability of Transformers may
actually stem from the new task lying within the span of those encountered
during training. We empirically show that our results also hold for models such
as GPT-2, and conclude with (i) experiments on how our observations extend to
nonlinear function classes and (ii) results on how LoRA has the ability to
capture distribution shifts.

Abstract: The wide deployment of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) has
raised privacy concerns for both clients and servers. While cryptographic
primitives can be employed for secure GPT inference to protect the privacy of
both parties, they introduce considerable performance overhead.To accelerate
secure inference, this study proposes a public decoding and secure verification
approach that utilizes public GPT models, motivated by the observation that
securely decoding one and multiple tokens takes a similar latency. The client
uses the public model to generate a set of tokens, which are then securely
verified by the private model for acceptance. The efficiency of our approach
depends on the acceptance ratio of tokens proposed by the public model, which
we improve from two aspects: (1) a private sampling protocol optimized for
cryptographic primitives and (2) model alignment using knowledge distillation.
Our approach improves the efficiency of secure decoding while maintaining the
same level of privacy and generation quality as standard secure decoding.
Experiments demonstrate a $2.1\times \sim 6.0\times$ speedup compared to
standard decoding across three pairs of public-private models and different
network conditions.

Abstract: As machine learning systems are increasingly used in high-stakes domains,
there is a growing emphasis placed on making them interpretable to improve
trust in these systems. In response, a range of interpretable machine learning
(IML) methods have been developed to generate human-understandable insights
into otherwise black box models. With these methods, a fundamental question
arises: Are these interpretations reliable? Unlike with prediction accuracy or
other evaluation metrics for supervised models, the proximity to the true
interpretation is difficult to define. Instead, we ask a closely related
question that we argue is a prerequisite for reliability: Are these
interpretations stable? We define stability as findings that are consistent or
reliable under small random perturbations to the data or algorithms. In this
study, we conduct the first systematic, large-scale empirical stability study
on popular machine learning global interpretations for both supervised and
unsupervised tasks on tabular data. Our findings reveal that popular
interpretation methods are frequently unstable, notably less stable than the
predictions themselves, and that there is no association between the accuracy
of machine learning predictions and the stability of their associated
interpretations. Moreover, we show that no single method consistently provides
the most stable interpretations across a range of benchmark datasets. Overall,
these results suggest that interpretability alone does not warrant trust, and
underscores the need for rigorous evaluation of interpretation stability in
future work. To support these principles, we have developed and released an
open source IML dashboard and Python package to enable researchers to assess
the stability and reliability of their own data-driven interpretations and
discoveries.

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) can
enhance autonomous driving (AD) performance in complex scenarios. However,
current LLM-Dominated RL methods over-rely on LLM outputs, which are prone to
hallucinations.Evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM indicates a
non-hallucination rate of only approximately 57.95% when assessed on essential
driving-related tasks. Thus, in these methods, hallucinations from the LLM can
directly jeopardize the performance of driving policies. This paper argues that
maintaining relative independence between the LLM and the RL is vital for
solving the hallucinations problem. Consequently, this paper is devoted to
propose a novel LLM-Hinted RL paradigm. The LLM is used to generate semantic
hints for state augmentation and policy optimization to assist RL agent in
motion planning, while the RL agent counteracts potential erroneous semantic
indications through policy learning to achieve excellent driving performance.
Based on this paradigm, we propose the HCRMP (LLM-Hinted Contextual
Reinforcement Learning Motion Planner) architecture, which is designed that
includes Augmented Semantic Representation Module to extend state space.
Contextual Stability Anchor Module enhances the reliability of multi-critic
weight hints by utilizing information from the knowledge base. Semantic Cache
Module is employed to seamlessly integrate LLM low-frequency guidance with RL
high-frequency control. Extensive experiments in CARLA validate HCRMP's strong
overall driving performance. HCRMP achieves a task success rate of up to 80.3%
under diverse driving conditions with different traffic densities. Under
safety-critical driving conditions, HCRMP significantly reduces the collision
rate by 11.4%, which effectively improves the driving performance in complex

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sequential decision-making tool widely used
for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown remarkable adaptability in low-data regimes, making them
promising tools for black-box optimization by leveraging contextual knowledge
to propose high-quality query points. However, relying solely on LLMs as
optimization agents introduces risks due to their lack of explicit surrogate
modeling and calibrated uncertainty, as well as their inherently opaque
internal mechanisms. This structural opacity makes it difficult to characterize
or control the exploration-exploitation trade-off, ultimately undermining
theoretical tractability and reliability. To address this, we propose LLINBO:
LLM-in-the-Loop BO, a hybrid framework for BO that combines LLMs with
statistical surrogate experts (e.g., Gaussian Processes (GP)). The core
philosophy is to leverage contextual reasoning strengths of LLMs for early
exploration, while relying on principled statistical models to guide efficient
exploitation. Specifically, we introduce three mechanisms that enable this
collaboration and establish their theoretical guarantees. We end the paper with
a real-life proof-of-concept in the context of 3D printing. The code to

Abstract: Imitation learning often assumes that demonstrations are close to optimal
according to some fixed, but unknown, cost function. However, according to
satisficing theory, humans often choose acceptable behavior based on their
personal (and potentially dynamic) levels of aspiration, rather than achieving
(near-) optimality. For example, a lunar lander demonstration that successfully
lands without crashing might be acceptable to a novice despite being slow or
jerky. Using a margin-based objective to guide deep reinforcement learning, our
focused satisficing approach to imitation learning seeks a policy that
surpasses the demonstrator's aspiration levels -- defined over trajectories or
portions of trajectories -- on unseen demonstrations without explicitly
learning those aspirations. We show experimentally that this focuses the policy
to imitate the highest quality (portions of) demonstrations better than
existing imitation learning methods, providing much higher rates of guaranteed
acceptability to the demonstrator, and competitive true returns on a range of
environments.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are notoriously hard to understand and difficult
to defend. Extracting representative paths (including the neuron activation
values and the connections between neurons) from DNNs using software
engineering approaches has recently shown to be a promising approach in
interpreting the decision making process of blackbox DNNs, as the extracted
paths are often effective in capturing essential features. With this in mind,
this work investigates a novel approach that extracts critical paths from DNNs
and subsequently applies the extracted paths for the anomaly detection task,
based on the observation that outliers and adversarial inputs do not usually
induce the same activation pattern on those paths as normal (in-distribution)
inputs.
  In our approach, we first identify critical detection paths via genetic
evolution and mutation. Since different paths in a DNN often capture different
features for the same target class, we ensemble detection results from multiple
paths by integrating random subspace sampling and a voting mechanism. Compared
with state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results suggest that our method
not only outperforms them, but it is also suitable for the detection of a broad
range of anomaly types with high accuracy.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在对抗攻击下表现脆弱，尤其是在参数高效微调（PEFT）场景中。研究旨在提升CLIP模型在少样本微调时的对抗鲁棒性。

Result: AdvCLIP-LoRA显著提升了模型对常见对抗攻击（如FGSM、PGD）的鲁棒性，同时保持了较高的干净数据准确率。

Conclusion: AdvCLIP-LoRA是一种实用且理论支持的方法，适用于资源受限环境下VLMs的鲁棒微调。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance
in cross-modal tasks through large-scale contrastive pre-training. To adapt
these large transformer-based models efficiently for downstream tasks,
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA have emerged as
scalable alternatives to full fine-tuning, especially in few-shot scenarios.
However, like traditional deep neural networks, VLMs are highly vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations can significantly
degrade model performance. Adversarial training remains the most effective
strategy for improving model robustness in PEFT. In this work, we propose
AdvCLIP-LoRA, the first algorithm designed to enhance the adversarial
robustness of CLIP models fine-tuned with LoRA in few-shot settings. Our method
formulates adversarial fine-tuning as a minimax optimization problem and
provides theoretical guarantees for convergence under smoothness and
nonconvex-strong-concavity assumptions. Empirical results across eight datasets
using ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32 models show that AdvCLIP-LoRA significantly
improves robustness against common adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD),
without sacrificing much clean accuracy. These findings highlight AdvCLIP-LoRA
as a practical and theoretically grounded approach for robust adaptation of
VLMs in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
autonomous agents to interact with computers via Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs), where accurately localizing the coordinates of interface elements
(e.g., buttons) is often required for fine-grained actions. However, this
remains significantly challenging, leading prior works to rely on large-scale
web datasets to improve the grounding accuracy. In this work, we propose
Reasoning Graphical User Interface Grounding for Data Efficiency (ReGUIDE), a
novel and effective framework for web grounding that enables MLLMs to learn
data efficiently through self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism.
More specifically, ReGUIDE learns to (i) self-generate a language reasoning
process for the localization via online reinforcement learning, and (ii)
criticize the prediction using spatial priors that enforce equivariance under
input transformations. At inference time, ReGUIDE further boosts performance
through a test-time scaling strategy, which combines spatial search with
coordinate aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that ReGUIDE significantly
advances web grounding performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming
baselines with substantially fewer training data points (e.g., only 0.2%
samples compared to the best open-sourced baselines).

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，AM-PPO表现更优，学习过程更稳定，减少了优化器的裁剪需求。

Conclusion: 优势调制是一种广泛适用的强化学习优化技术。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a widely used reinforcement learning
algorithm that heavily relies on accurate advantage estimates for stable and
efficient training. However, raw advantage signals can exhibit significant
variance, noise, and scale-related issues, impeding optimal learning
performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Advantage Modulation PPO
(AM-PPO), a novel enhancement of PPO that adaptively modulates advantage
estimates using a dynamic, non-linear scaling mechanism. This adaptive
modulation employs an alpha controller that dynamically adjusts the scaling
factor based on evolving statistical properties of the advantage signals, such
as their norm, variance, and a predefined target saturation level. By
incorporating a tanh-based gating function driven by these adaptively scaled
advantages, AM-PPO reshapes the advantage signals to stabilize gradient updates
and improve the conditioning of the policy gradient landscape. Crucially, this
modulation also influences value function training by providing consistent and
adaptively conditioned learning targets. Empirical evaluations across standard
continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that AM-PPO achieves superior reward
trajectories, exhibits sustained learning progression, and significantly
reduces the clipping required by adaptive optimizers. These findings underscore
the potential of advantage modulation as a broadly applicable technique for
enhancing reinforcement learning optimization.

Abstract: While eXplainable AI (XAI) has advanced significantly, few methods address

approach adapts saliency-based techniques from RISE to explain the distance
between two embedded data points by assigning attribution values through
selective masking and distance-ranked mask filtering. We evaluate Distance
Explainer on cross-modal embeddings (image-image and image-caption pairs) using
established XAI metrics including Faithfulness, Sensitivity/Robustness, and
Randomization. Experiments with ImageNet and CLIP models demonstrate that our
method effectively identifies features contributing to similarity or
dissimilarity between embedded data points while maintaining high robustness
and consistency. We also explore how parameter tuning, particularly mask
quantity and selection strategy, affects explanation quality. This work
addresses a critical gap in XAI research and enhances transparency and
trustworthiness in deep learning applications utilizing embedded spaces.

Abstract: Certifying the IID generalisation ability of deep networks is the first of
many requirements for trusting AI in high-stakes applications from medicine to
security. However, when instantiating generalisation bounds for deep networks
it remains challenging to obtain non-vacuous guarantees, especially when
applying contemporary large models on the small scale data prevalent in such
high-stakes fields. In this paper, we draw a novel connection between a family
of learning methods based on model fusion and generalisation certificates, and
surprisingly show that with minor adjustment several existing learning
strategies already provide non-trivial generalisation guarantees. Essentially,
by focusing on data-driven learning of downstream tasks by fusion rather than
fine-tuning, the certified generalisation gap becomes tiny and independent of
the base network size, facilitating its certification. Our results show for the
first time non-trivial generalisation guarantees for learning with as low as
100 examples, while using vision models such as VIT-B and language models such
as mistral-7B. This observation is significant as it has immediate implications
for facilitating the certification of existing systems as trustworthy, and
opens up new directions for research at the intersection of practice and
theory.

Abstract: AI systems in high-consequence domains such as defense, intelligence, and
disaster response must detect rare, high-impact events while operating under
tight resource constraints. Traditional annotation strategies that prioritize
label volume over informational value introduce redundancy and noise, limiting
model generalization. This paper introduces smart-sizing, a training data
strategy that emphasizes label diversity, model-guided selection, and marginal
utility-based stopping. We implement this through Adaptive Label Optimization
(ALO), combining pre-labeling triage, annotator disagreement analysis, and
iterative feedback to prioritize labels that meaningfully improve model
performance. Experiments show that models trained on 20 to 40 percent of
curated data can match or exceed full-data baselines, particularly in
rare-class recall and edge-case generalization. We also demonstrate how latent
labeling errors embedded in training and validation sets can distort
evaluation, underscoring the need for embedded audit tools and
performance-aware governance. Smart-sizing reframes annotation as a
feedback-driven process aligned with mission outcomes, enabling more robust
models with fewer labels and supporting efficient AI development pipelines for
frontier models and operational systems.

Abstract: Graph-structured data pervades domains such as social networks, biological
systems, knowledge graphs, and recommender systems. While foundation models
have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning
through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these
capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex
relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To
this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose
intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric
tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs,
unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key
components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation
mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal,
task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key
innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology,
we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent
capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment,
heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of
graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational
infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data. This survey

Abstract: The empirical emergence of neural collapse -- a surprising symmetry in the
feature representations of the training data in the penultimate layer of deep
neural networks -- has spurred a line of theoretical research aimed at its
understanding. However, existing work focuses on data-agnostic models or, when
data structure is taken into account, it remains limited to multi-layer
perceptrons. Our paper fills both these gaps by analyzing modern architectures
in a data-aware regime: we prove that global optima of deep regularized
transformers and residual networks (ResNets) with LayerNorm trained with cross
entropy or mean squared error loss are approximately collapsed, and the
approximation gets tighter as the depth grows. More generally, we formally
reduce any end-to-end large-depth ResNet or transformer training into an
equivalent unconstrained features model, thus justifying its wide use in the
literature even beyond data-agnostic settings. Our theoretical results are
supported by experiments on computer vision and language datasets showing that,
as the depth grows, neural collapse indeed becomes more prominent.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the informativeness of individual samples in a dataset
is an important objective in deep learning, as it can guide sample selection,
which can improve model efficiency and accuracy by removing redundant or
potentially harmful samples. We propose Laplace Sample Information (LSI)
measure of sample informativeness grounded in information theory widely
applicable across model architectures and learning settings. LSI leverages a
Bayesian approximation to the weight posterior and the KL divergence to measure
the change in the parameter distribution induced by a sample of interest from
the dataset. We experimentally show that LSI is effective in ordering the data
with respect to typicality, detecting mislabeled samples, measuring class-wise
informativeness, and assessing dataset difficulty. We demonstrate these
capabilities of LSI on image and text data in supervised and unsupervised
settings. Moreover, we show that LSI can be computed efficiently through probes
and transfers well to the training of large models.

While additional information, such as that available in simulations, can

a guider and a learner. The guider takes advantage of privileged information
while ensuring alignment with the learner's policy that is primarily trained
via imitation learning. We theoretically demonstrate that this learning scheme

Abstract: We introduce a new algebraic structure for multi-dimensional compositional
embeddings, built on directional non-commutative monoidal operators. The core
contribution of this work is this novel framework, which exhibits appealing
theoretical properties (associativity along each dimension and an interchange
law ensuring global consistency) while remaining compatible with modern machine
learning architectures. Our construction defines a distinct composition
operator circ_i for each axis i, ensuring associative combination along each
axis without imposing global commutativity. Importantly, all axis-specific
operators commute with one another, enforcing a global interchange law that
enables consistent crossaxis compositions. This is, to our knowledge, the first
approach that provides a common foundation that generalizes classical
sequence-modeling paradigms (e.g., structured state-space models (SSMs) and
transformer self-attention) to a unified multi-dimensional framework. For
example, specific one-dimensional instances of our framework can recover the
familiar affine transformation algebra, vanilla self-attention, and the
SSM-style recurrence. The higher-dimensional generalizations naturally support
recursive, structure-aware operations in embedding spaces. We outline several
potential applications unlocked by this structure-including structured
positional encodings in Transformers, directional image embeddings, and
symbolic modeling of sequences or grids-indicating that it could inform future
deep learning model designs. We formally establish the algebraic properties of
our framework and discuss efficient implementations. Finally, as our focus is
theoretical, we include no experiments here and defer empirical validation to
future work, which we plan to undertake.

Abstract: For continuous systems modeled by dynamical equations such as ODEs and SDEs,
Bellman's principle of optimality takes the form of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
(HJB) equation, which provides the theoretical target of reinforcement learning
(RL). Although recent advances in RL successfully leverage this formulation,
the existing methods typically assume the underlying dynamics are known a
priori because they need explicit access to the coefficient functions of
dynamical equations to update the value function following the HJB equation. We
address this inherent limitation of HJB-based RL; we propose a model-free
approach still targeting the HJB equation and propose the corresponding
temporal difference method. We demonstrate its potential advantages over
transition kernel-based formulations, both qualitatively and empirically. The
proposed formulation paves the way toward bridging stochastic optimal control
and model-free reinforcement learning.

Abstract: The data-to-equation (Data2Eqn) task aims to discover interpretable
mathematical equations that map observed values to labels, offering physical
insights and broad applicability across academic and industrial domains.
Genetic programming and traditional deep learning-based approaches suffer from
search inefficiency and poor generalization on small task-specific datasets.
Foundation models showed promise in this area, but existing approaches suffer
from: 1) They are pretrained on general-purpose data distributions, making them
less effective for domain-specific tasks; and 2) their training objectives
focus on token-level alignment, overlooking mathematical semantics, which can
lead to inaccurate equations. To address these issues, we aim to enhance the
domain adaptability of foundation models for Data2Eqn tasks. In this work, we
propose a reinforcement learning-based finetuning framework that directly
optimizes the generation policy of a pretrained model through reward signals
derived from downstream numerical fitness. Our method allows the model to adapt
to specific and complex data distributions and generate mathematically
meaningful equations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
improves both the accuracy and robustness of equation generation under complex

Abstract: Continuous time systems are often modeled using discrete time dynamics but
this requires a small simulation step to maintain accuracy. In turn, this
requires a large planning horizon which leads to computationally demanding
planning problems and reduced performance. Previous work in model free
reinforcement learning has partially addressed this issue using action repeats
where a policy is learned to determine a discrete action duration. Instead we
propose to control the continuous decision timescale directly by using
temporally-extended actions and letting the planner treat the duration of the
action as an additional optimization variable along with the standard action
variables. This additional structure has multiple advantages. It speeds up
simulation time of trajectories and, importantly, it allows for deep horizon
search in terms of primitive actions while using a shallow search depth in the
planner. In addition, in the model based reinforcement learning (MBRL) setting,
it reduces compounding errors from model learning and improves training time
for models. We show that this idea is effective and that the range for action
durations can be automatically selected using a multi-armed bandit formulation
and integrated into the MBRL framework. An extensive experimental evaluation
both in planning and in MBRL, shows that our approach yields faster planning,
better solutions, and that it enables solutions to problems that are not solved
in the standard formulation.

Abstract: A new strategy for fair supervised machine learning is proposed. The main
advantages of the proposed strategy as compared to others in the literature are
as follows. (a) We introduce a new smooth nonconvex surrogate to approximate
the Heaviside functions involved in discontinuous unfairness measures. The
surrogate is based on smoothing methods from the optimization literature, and
is new for the fair supervised learning literature. The surrogate is a tight
approximation which ensures the trained prediction models are fair, as opposed
to other (e.g., convex) surrogates that can fail to lead to a fair prediction
model in practice. (b) Rather than rely on regularizers (that lead to
optimization problems that are difficult to solve) and corresponding
regularization parameters (that can be expensive to tune), we propose a
strategy that employs hard constraints so that specific tolerances for
unfairness can be enforced without the complications associated with the use of
regularization. (c)~Our proposed strategy readily allows for constraints on
multiple (potentially conflicting) unfairness measures at the same time.
Multiple measures can be considered with a regularization approach, but at the
cost of having even more difficult optimization problems to solve and further
expense for tuning. By contrast, through hard constraints, our strategy leads
to optimization models that can be solved tractably with minimal tuning.

Abstract: We study the problem of creating strong, yet narrow, AI systems. While recent
AI progress has been driven by the training of large general-purpose foundation
models, the creation of smaller models specialized for narrow domains could be
valuable for both efficiency and safety. In this work, we explore two
challenges involved in creating such systems, having to do with basic
properties of how neural networks learn and structure their representations.
The first challenge regards when it is possible to train narrow models from
scratch. Through experiments on a synthetic task, we find that it is sometimes
necessary to train networks on a wide distribution of data to learn certain
narrow skills within that distribution. This effect arises when skills depend
on each other hierarchically, and training on a broad distribution introduces a
curriculum which substantially accelerates learning. The second challenge
regards how to transfer particular skills from large general models into small
specialized models. We find that model skills are often not perfectly localized
to a particular set of prunable components. However, we find that methods based
on pruning can still outperform distillation. We investigate the use of a
regularization objective to align desired skills with prunable components while
unlearning unnecessary skills.

within the encoder for classification tasks, such as code search. It also
employs the encoder-decoder attention scores to determine token significance

Abstract: First-order adaptive optimization methods like Adam are the default choices

theoretical understanding of these methods in non-smooth settings, particularly
in Deep ReLU networks, remains limited. ReLU activations create exponentially
many region boundaries where standard smoothness assumptions break down.
\textbf{We derive the first

Adam in Deep ReLU networks and the first global-optimal convergence for Adam in
the non smooth, non convex relu landscape without a global PL or convexity
assumption.} Our analysis is based on stratified Morse theory and novel results
in Kakeya sets. We develop a multi-layer refinement framework that
progressively tightens bounds on region crossings. We prove that the number of
region crossings collapses from exponential to near-linear in the effective
dimension. Using a Kakeya based method, we give a tighter generalization bound
than PAC-Bayes approaches and showcase convergence using a mild uniform low

Abstract: Retraining a model using its own predictions together with the original,
potentially noisy labels is a well-known strategy for improving the model
performance. While prior works have demonstrated the benefits of specific
heuristic retraining schemes, the question of how to optimally combine the
model's predictions and the provided labels remains largely open. This paper
addresses this fundamental question for binary classification tasks. We develop
a principled framework based on approximate message passing (AMP) to analyze
iterative retraining procedures for two ground truth settings: Gaussian mixture
model (GMM) and generalized linear model (GLM). Our main contribution is the
derivation of the Bayes optimal aggregator function to combine the current
model's predictions and the given labels, which when used to retrain the same
model, minimizes its prediction error. We also quantify the performance of this
optimal retraining strategy over multiple rounds. We complement our theoretical
results by proposing a practically usable version of the theoretically-optimal
aggregator function for linear probing with the cross-entropy loss, and
demonstrate its superiority over baseline methods in the high label noise
regime.

Abstract: Gradient-based learning imposes (deep) neural networks to be differentiable
at all steps. This includes model-based architectures constructed by unrolling
iterations of an iterative algorithm onto layers of a neural network, known as
algorithm unrolling. However, greedy sparse recovery algorithms depend on the
non-differentiable argsort operator, which hinders their integration into
neural networks. In this paper, we address this challenge in Orthogonal
Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), two popular
representative algorithms in this class. We propose permutation-based variants
of these algorithms and approximate permutation matrices using "soft"
permutation matrices derived from softsort, a continuous relaxation of argsort.
We demonstrate -- both theoretically and numerically -- that Soft-OMP and
Soft-IHT, as differentiable counterparts of OMP and IHT and fully compatible
with neural network training, effectively approximate these algorithms with a
controllable degree of accuracy. This leads to the development of OMP- and
IHT-Net, fully trainable network architectures based on Soft-OMP and Soft-IHT,
respectively. Finally, by choosing weights as "structure-aware" trainable
parameters, we connect our approach to structured sparse recovery and
demonstrate its ability to extract latent sparsity patterns from data.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks have achieved remarkable achievements across various
domains, however balancing performance and generalization still remains a
challenge while training these networks. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that uses a cyclic optimization strategy to concurrently optimize the
model and its input data for better training, rethinking the traditional
training paradigm. Central to our approach is Iterative Constructive
Perturbation (ICP), which leverages the model's loss to iteratively perturb the
input, progressively constructing an enhanced representation over some
refinement steps. This ICP input is then fed back into the model to produce
improved intermediate features, which serve as a target in a self-distillation
framework against the original features. By alternately altering the model's
parameters to the data and the data to the model, our method effectively
addresses the gap between fitting and generalization, leading to enhanced
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only
mitigates common performance bottlenecks in neural networks but also
demonstrates significant improvements across training variations.

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a promising
approach for pretraining generalist policies on large datasets of reward-free
trajectories, akin to the self-supervised objectives used to train foundation
models for computer vision and natural language processing. However, scaling
GCRL to longer horizons remains challenging due to the combination of sparse
rewards and discounting, which obscures the comparative advantages of primitive
actions with respect to distant goals. Hierarchical RL methods achieve strong
empirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks, but their reliance on
modular, timescale-specific policies and subgoal generation introduces
significant additional complexity and hinders scaling to high-dimensional goal
spaces. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to train a flat
(non-hierarchical) goal-conditioned policy by bootstrapping on
subgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling. Our
approach eliminates the need for a generative model over the (sub)goal space,
which we find is key for scaling to high-dimensional control in large state
spaces. We further show that existing hierarchical and bootstrapping-based
approaches correspond to specific design choices within our derivation. Across
a comprehensive suite of state- and pixel-based locomotion and manipulation
benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art offline GCRL
algorithms and scales to complex, long-horizon tasks where prior approaches
fail.

Abstract: Recent theory has reduced the depth dependence of generalization bounds from
exponential to polynomial and even depth-independent rates, yet these results
remain tied to specific architectures and Euclidean inputs. We present a
unified framework for arbitrary \blue{pseudo-metric} spaces in which a
depth-\(k\) network is the composition of continuous hidden maps
\(f:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}\) and an output map \(h:\mathcal{X}\to
\mathbb{R}\). The resulting bound $O(\sqrt{(\alpha + \log \beta(k))/n})$
isolates the sole depth contribution in \(\beta(k)\), the word-ball growth of
the semigroup generated by the hidden layers. By Gromov's theorem polynomial
(resp. exponential) growth corresponds to virtually nilpotent (resp. expanding)
dynamics, revealing a geometric dichotomy behind existing $O(\sqrt{k})$
(sublinear depth) and $\tilde{O}(1)$ (depth-independent) rates. We further
provide covering-number estimates showing that expanding dynamics yield an
exponential parameter saving via compositional expressivity. Our results
decouple specification from implementation, offering architecture-agnostic and
dynamical-systems-aware guarantees applicable to modern deep-learning paradigms
such as test-time inference and diffusion models.

Abstract: In the past few years, time series foundation models have achieved superior
predicting accuracy. However, real-world time series often exhibit significant
diversity in their temporal patterns across different time spans and domains,
making it challenging for a single model architecture to fit all complex
scenarios. In addition, time series data may have multiple variables exhibiting
complex correlations between each other. Recent mainstream works have focused
on modeling times series in a channel-independent manner in both pretraining
and finetuning stages, overlooking the valuable inter-series dependencies. To
this end, we propose \textbf{Time Tracker} for better predictions on
multivariate time series data. Firstly, we leverage sparse mixture of experts
(MoE) within Transformers to handle the modeling of diverse time series
patterns, thereby alleviating the learning difficulties of a single model while
improving its generalization. Besides, we propose Any-variate Attention,
enabling a unified model structure to seamlessly handle both univariate and
multivariate time series, thereby supporting channel-independent modeling
during pretraining and channel-mixed modeling for finetuning. Furthermore, we
design a graph learning module that constructs relations among sequences from
frequency-domain features, providing more precise guidance to capture
inter-series dependencies in channel-mixed modeling. Based on these
advancements, Time Tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting
accuracy, model generalization and adaptability.

Abstract: Feature Transformation (FT) crafts new features from original ones via
mathematical operations to enhance dataset expressiveness for downstream
models. However, existing FT methods exhibit critical limitations: discrete
search struggles with enormous combinatorial spaces, impeding practical use;
and continuous search, being highly sensitive to initialization and step sizes,
often becomes trapped in local optima, restricting global exploration. To
overcome these limitations, DIFFT redefines FT as a reward-guided generative
task. It first learns a compact and expressive latent space for feature sets
using a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). A Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) then
navigates this space to generate high-quality feature embeddings, its
trajectory guided by a performance evaluator towards task-specific optima. This
synthesis of global distribution learning (from LDM) and targeted optimization
(reward guidance) produces potent embeddings, which a novel semi-autoregressive
decoder efficiently converts into structured, discrete features, preserving
intra-feature dependencies while allowing parallel inter-feature generation.
Extensive experiments on 14 benchmark datasets show DIFFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy and robustness,
with significantly lower training and inference times.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep models have highlighted the need for intelligent

machine unlearning (MU) for data removal, forming the Continual
Learning-Unlearning (CLU) paradigm. While existing work treats CL and MU as
separate processes, we reveal their intrinsic connection through a unified
optimization framework based on Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization. This
framework decomposes gradient updates for approximate CLU into four components:
learning new knowledge, unlearning targeted data, preserving existing
knowledge, and modulation via weight saliency. A critical challenge lies in
balancing knowledge update and retention during sequential learning-unlearning
cycles. To resolve this stability-plasticity dilemma, we introduce a
remain-preserved manifold constraint to induce a remaining Hessian compensation
for CLU iterations. A fast-slow weight adaptation mechanism is designed to
efficiently approximate the second-order optimization direction, combined with
adaptive weighting coefficients and a balanced weight saliency mask, proposing
a unified implementation framework for gradient-based CLU. Furthermore, we
pioneer task-agnostic CLU scenarios that support fine-grained unlearning at the
cross-task category and random sample levels beyond the traditional task-aware
setups. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UG-CLU framework effectively
coordinates incremental learning, precise unlearning, and knowledge stability
across multiple datasets and model architectures, providing a theoretical

Abstract: Although Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are designed to capture
multiple modes of a reward function, they often suffer from mode collapse in
practice, getting trapped in early discovered modes and requiring prolonged
training to find diverse solutions. Existing exploration techniques may rely on
heuristic novelty signals. We propose Loss-Guided GFlowNets (LGGFN), a novel
approach where an auxiliary GFlowNet's exploration is directly driven by the
main GFlowNet's training loss. By prioritizing trajectories where the main
model exhibits high loss, LGGFN focuses sampling on poorly understood regions
of the state space. This targeted exploration significantly accelerates the
discovery of diverse, high-reward samples. Empirically, across various
benchmarks including grid environments, structured sequence generation, and
Bayesian structure learning, LGGFN consistently enhances exploration efficiency
and sample diversity compared to baselines. For instance, on a challenging
sequence generation task, it discovered over 40 times more unique valid modes
while simultaneously reducing the exploration error metric by approximately

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection is vital for the reliability of deep
neural networks, the key of which lies in effectively characterizing the
disparities between OoD and In-Distribution (InD) data. In this work, such
disparities are exploited through a fresh perspective of non-linear feature
subspace. That is, a discriminative non-linear subspace is learned from InD
features to capture representative patterns of InD, while informative patterns
of OoD features cannot be well captured in such a subspace due to their
different distribution. Grounded on this perspective, we exploit the deviations
of InD and OoD features in such a non-linear subspace for effective OoD
detection. To be specific, we leverage the framework of Kernel Principal
Component Analysis (KPCA) to attain the discriminative non-linear subspace and
deploy the reconstruction error on such subspace to distinguish InD and OoD
data. Two challenges emerge: (i) the learning of an effective non-linear
subspace, i.e., the selection of kernel function in KPCA, and (ii) the
computation of the kernel matrix with large-scale InD data. For the former, we
reveal two vital non-linear patterns that closely relate to the InD-OoD
disparity, leading to the establishment of a Cosine-Gaussian kernel for
constructing the subspace. For the latter, we introduce two techniques to
approximate the Cosine-Gaussian kernel with significantly cheap computations.
In particular, our approximation is further tailored by incorporating the InD
data confidence, which is demonstrated to promote the learning of
discriminative subspaces for OoD data. Our study presents new insights into the
non-linear feature subspace for OoD detection and contributes practical
explorations on the associated kernel design and efficient computations,
yielding a KPCA detection method with distinctively improved efficacy and
efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Sonnet的新架构，结合可学习的小波变换和Koopman算子的谱分析，通过多变量相干注意力（MVCA）建模变量依赖关系，显著提升了多变量时间序列预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer在多变量时间序列预测中难以有效建模复杂变量关系，需要改进。

Method: 提出Sonnet架构，结合可学习小波变换和Koopman算子谱分析，引入MVCA建模变量依赖。

Result: 在47个预测任务中，Sonnet在34个任务上表现最佳，平均MAE降低1.1%；MVCA替换传统注意力机制后，在最具挑战性任务中平均MAE降低10.7%。

Conclusion: Sonnet和MVCA显著提升了多变量时间序列预测的性能，尤其在复杂任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Multivariable time series forecasting methods can integrate information from
exogenous variables, leading to significant prediction accuracy gains.
Transformer architecture has been widely applied in various time series
forecasting models due to its ability to capture long-range sequential
dependencies. However, a na\"ive application of transformers often struggles to
effectively model complex relationships among variables over time. To mitigate
against this, we propose a novel architecture, namely the Spectral Operator
Neural Network (Sonnet). Sonnet applies learnable wavelet transformations to
the input and incorporates spectral analysis using the Koopman operator. Its
predictive skill relies on the Multivariable Coherence Attention (MVCA), an
operation that leverages spectral coherence to model variable dependencies. Our
empirical analysis shows that Sonnet yields the best performance on $34$ out of
$47$ forecasting tasks with an average mean absolute error (MAE) reduction of
$1.1\%$ against the most competitive baseline (different per task). We further
show that MVCA -- when put in place of the na\"ive attention used in various
deep learning models -- can remedy its deficiencies, reducing MAE by $10.7\%$
on average in the most challenging forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Neural networks hold great potential to act as approximate models of
nonlinear dynamical systems, with the resulting neural approximations enabling
verification and control of such systems. However, in safety-critical contexts,
the use of neural approximations requires formal bounds on their closeness to
the underlying system. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a
novel, adaptive, and parallelizable verification method based on certified
first-order models. Our approach provides formal error bounds on the neural
approximations of dynamical systems, allowing them to be safely employed as
surrogates by interpreting the error bound as bounded disturbances acting on
the approximated dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of
our method on a range of established benchmarks from the literature, showing
that it outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight the
flexibility of our framework by applying it to two novel scenarios not
previously explored in this context: neural network compression and an
autoencoder-based deep learning architecture for learning Koopman operators,
both yielding compelling results.

Abstract: Concept discovery in neural networks often targets individual neurons or
human-interpretable features, overlooking distributed layer-wide patterns. We
study the Neural Activation Pattern (NAP) methodology, which clusters
full-layer activation distributions to identify such layer-level concepts.
Applied to visual object recognition and radio receiver models, we propose
improved normalization, distribution estimation, distance metrics, and varied
cluster selection. In the radio receiver model, distinct concepts did not
emerge; instead, a continuous activation manifold shaped by Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (SNR) was observed -- highlighting SNR as a key learned factor,
consistent with classical receiver behavior and supporting physical
plausibility. Our enhancements to NAP improved in-distribution vs.
out-of-distribution separation, suggesting better generalization and indirectly
validating clustering quality. These results underscore the importance of
clustering design and activation manifolds in interpreting and troubleshooting

Abstract: Sample-wise learning curves plot performance versus training set size. They
are useful for studying scaling laws and speeding up hyperparameter tuning and
model selection. Learning curves are often assumed to be well-behaved: monotone
(i.e. improving with more data) and convex. By constructing the Learning Curves
Database 1.1 (LCDB 1.1), a large-scale database with high-resolution learning
curves, we show that learning curves are less often well-behaved than
previously thought. Using statistically rigorous methods, we observe
significant ill-behavior in approximately 14% of the learning curves, almost
twice as much as in previous estimates. We also identify which learners are to
blame and show that specific learners are more ill-behaved than others.
Additionally, we demonstrate that different feature scalings rarely resolve
ill-behavior. We evaluate the impact of ill-behavior on downstream tasks, such
as learning curve fitting and model selection, and find it poses significant
challenges, underscoring the relevance and potential of LCDB 1.1 as a

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for integrating fragmented multi-modal data in
Alzheimer's disease (AD) research using large language models (LLMs) and
knowledge graphs. While traditional multimodal analysis requires matched
patient IDs across datasets, our approach demonstrates population-level
integration of MRI, gene expression, biomarkers, EEG, and clinical indicators
from independent cohorts. Statistical analysis identified significant features
in each modality, which were connected as nodes in a knowledge graph. LLMs then
analyzed the graph to extract potential correlations and generate hypotheses in
natural language. This approach revealed several novel relationships, including
a potential pathway linking metabolic risk factors to tau protein abnormalities
via neuroinflammation (r>0.6, p<0.001), and unexpected correlations between
frontal EEG channels and specific gene expression profiles (r=0.42-0.58,
p<0.01). Cross-validation with independent datasets confirmed the robustness of
major findings, with consistent effect sizes across cohorts (variance <15%).
The reproducibility of these findings was further supported by expert review
(Cohen's k=0.82) and computational validation. Our framework enables cross
modal integration at a conceptual level without requiring patient ID matching,
offering new possibilities for understanding AD pathology through fragmented
data reuse and generating testable hypotheses for future research.

Conclusion: 论文强调了能源感知基准测试的关键考虑因素，并提供了设计新基准的初步指南。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) accelerates progress in deep learning
through systematic refinement of model architectures. The downside is
increasingly large energy consumption during the search process.
Surrogate-based benchmarking mitigates the cost of full training by querying a
pre-trained surrogate to obtain an estimate for the quality of the model.
Specifically, energy-aware benchmarking aims to make it possible for NAS to
favourably trade off model energy consumption against accuracy. Towards this
end, we propose three design principles for such energy-aware benchmarks: (i)
reliable power measurements, (ii) a wide range of GPU usage, and (iii) holistic
cost reporting. We analyse EA-HAS-Bench based on these principles and find that
the choice of GPU measurement API has a large impact on the quality of results.
Using the Nvidia System Management Interface (SMI) on top of its underlying
library influences the sampling rate during the initial data collection,
returning faulty low-power estimations. This results in poor correlation with
accurate measurements obtained from an external power meter. With this study,
we bring to attention several key considerations when performing energy-aware
surrogate-based benchmarking and derive first guidelines that can help design
novel benchmarks. We show a narrow usage range of the four GPUs attached to our
device, ranging from 146 W to 305 W in a single-GPU setting, and narrowing down
even further when using all four GPUs. To improve holistic energy reporting, we
propose calibration experiments over assumptions made in popular tools, such as
Code Carbon, thus achieving reductions in the maximum inaccuracy from 10.3 % to
8.9 % without and to 6.6 % with prior estimation of the expected load on the
device.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of estimation and learning under temporal
distribution shift. Consider an observation sequence of length $n$, which is a
noisy realization of a time-varying groundtruth sequence. Our focus is to
develop methods to estimate the groundtruth at the final time-step while
providing sharp point-wise estimation error rates. We show that, without prior
knowledge on the level of temporal shift, a wavelet soft-thresholding estimator
provides an optimal estimation error bound for the groundtruth. Our proposed
estimation method generalizes existing researches Mazzetto and Upfal (2023) by
establishing a connection between the sequence's non-stationarity level and the
sparsity in the wavelet-transformed domain. Our theoretical findings are
validated by numerical experiments. Additionally, we applied the estimator to
derive sparsity-aware excess risk bounds for binary classification under
distribution shift and to develop computationally efficient training
objectives. As a final contribution, we draw parallels between our results and
the classical signal processing problem of total-variation denoising (Mammen
and van de Geer,1997; Tibshirani, 2014), uncovering novel optimal algorithms
for such task.

result is a powerful framework capable of approximating functions that evolve

mathematical foundations of these operators, proving three key theorems of
Voronovskaya type. These results describe the asymptotic behavior of the
operators, their convergence in the mean-square sense, and their consistency
under fractional regularity assumptions. All estimates explicitly account for
the influence of the memory parameter $\alpha$ and the noise level $\sigma$. As
a practical application, we apply the proposed theory to the fractional
Navier-Stokes equations with stochastic forcing, a model often used to describe
turbulence in fluid flows with memory. Our approach provides theoretical
guarantees for the approximation quality and suggests that these neural

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting has a wide range of applications
in both industry and academia. Recent advances in Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural
Network (STGNN) have achieved great progress in modelling spatial-temporal
correlations. Limited by computational complexity, most STGNNs for MTS
forecasting focus primarily on short-term and local spatial-temporal
dependencies. Although some recent methods attempt to incorporate univariate
history into modeling, they still overlook crucial long-term spatial-temporal
similarities and correlations across MTS, which are essential for accurate
forecasting. To fill this gap, we propose a framework called the Long-term
Multivariate History Representation (LMHR) Enhanced STGNN for MTS forecasting.
Specifically, a Long-term History Encoder (LHEncoder) is adopted to effectively
encode the long-term history into segment-level contextual representations and
reduce point-level noise. A non-parametric Hierarchical Representation
Retriever (HRetriever) is designed to include the spatial information in the
long-term spatial-temporal dependency modelling and pick out the most valuable
representations with no additional training. A Transformer-based Aggregator
(TAggregator) selectively fuses the sparsely retrieved contextual
representations based on the ranking positional embedding efficiently.
Experimental results demonstrate that LMHR outperforms typical STGNNs by 10.72%
on the average prediction horizons and state-of-the-art methods by 4.12% on
several real-world datasets. Additionally, it consistently improves prediction
accuracy by 9.8% on the top 10% of rapidly changing patterns across the
datasets.

Conclusion: 优化的训练过程不仅节省了资源，还缩短了生成模型的训练时间。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are able to generate synthetic
sensor signals. The training process of such a model is controlled by a loss
function which measures the difference between the noise that was added in the
forward process and the noise that was predicted by the diffusion model. This
enables the generation of realistic data. However, the randomness within the
process and the loss function itself makes it difficult to estimate the quality
of the data. Therefore, we examine multiple similarity metrics and adapt an
existing metric to overcome this issue by monitoring the training and
synthetisation process using those metrics. The adapted metric can even be
fine-tuned on the input data to comply with the requirements of an underlying
classification task. We were able to significantly reduce the amount of
training epochs without a performance reduction in the classification task. An
optimized training process not only saves resources, but also reduces the time
for training generative models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models across
various modalities, including image, video, and audio synthesis. However, their
deployment is often limited by significant inference latency, primarily due to
the inherently sequential nature of the denoising process. While existing
parallelization strategies attempt to accelerate inference by distributing
computation across multiple devices, they typically incur high communication
overhead, hindering deployment on commercial hardware. To address this
challenge, we propose \textbf{ParaStep}, a novel parallelization method based
on a reuse-then-predict mechanism that parallelizes diffusion inference by
exploiting similarity between adjacent denoising steps. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on layer-wise or stage-wise communication, ParaStep employs
lightweight, step-wise communication, substantially reducing overhead. ParaStep
achieves end-to-end speedups of up to \textbf{3.88}$\times$ on SVD,
\textbf{2.43}$\times$ on CogVideoX-2b, and \textbf{6.56}$\times$ on

ParaStep as a scalable and communication-efficient solution for accelerating

Abstract: GraphSAGE is a widely used graph neural network. The introduction of causal
inference has improved its robust performance and named as Causal GraphSAGE.
However, Causal GraphSAGE focuses on measuring causal weighting among
individual nodes, but neglecting the cooperative relationships among sampling
nodes as a whole. To address this issue, this paper proposes Cooperative Causal
GraphSAGE (CoCa-GraphSAGE), which combines cooperative game theory with Causal
GraphSAGE. Initially, a cooperative causal structure model is constructed in
the case of cooperation based on the graph structure. Subsequently, Cooperative
Causal sampling (CoCa-sampling) algorithm is proposed, employing the Shapley
values to calculate the cooperative contribution based on causal weights of the
nodes sets. CoCa-sampling guides the selection of nodes with significant
cooperative causal effects during the neighborhood sampling process, thus
integrating the selected neighborhood features under cooperative relationships,
which takes the sampled nodes as a whole and generates more stable target node
embeddings. Experiments on publicly available datasets show that the proposed
method has comparable classification performance to the compared methods and
outperforms under perturbations, demonstrating the robustness improvement by
CoCa-sampling.

Abstract: We introduce Toto, a time series forecasting foundation model with 151
million parameters. Toto uses a modern decoder-only architecture coupled with
architectural innovations designed to account for specific challenges found in
multivariate observability time series data. Toto's pre-training corpus is a
mixture of observability data, open datasets, and synthetic data, and is
4-10$\times$ larger than those of leading time series foundation models.
Additionally, we introduce BOOM, a large-scale benchmark consisting of 350
million observations across 2,807 real-world time series. For both Toto and
BOOM, we source observability data exclusively from Datadog's own telemetry and
internal observability metrics. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Toto
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both BOOM and on established general
purpose time series forecasting benchmarks. Toto's model weights, inference
code, and evaluation scripts, as well as BOOM's data and evaluation code, are

Motivation: 现有神经网络的优化算法多基于启发式梯度方法，缺乏理论基础。本文从动力学理论和偏微分方程模拟中汲取灵感，提出一种物理驱动的优化方法。

Method: KO将网络参数训练动态模拟为粒子系统的演化，利用Boltzmann传输方程的数值方案更新参数，通过类似热扩散的机制促进参数多样性。

Result: 在图像分类（CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet）和文本分类（IMDB, Snips）任务中，KO在保持计算成本相近的情况下，准确率优于Adam和SGD等基线优化器。

Conclusion: KO通过物理驱动的优化方法有效解决了参数凝聚问题，提升了模型性能，为神经网络优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The design of optimization algorithms for neural networks remains a critical
challenge, with most existing methods relying on heuristic adaptations of
gradient-based approaches. This paper introduces KO (Kinetics-inspired
Optimizer), a novel neural optimizer inspired by kinetic theory and partial
differential equation (PDE) simulations. We reimagine the training dynamics of
network parameters as the evolution of a particle system governed by kinetic
principles, where parameter updates are simulated via a numerical scheme for
the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) that models stochastic particle
collisions. This physics-driven approach inherently promotes parameter
diversity during optimization, mitigating the phenomenon of parameter
condensation, i.e. collapse of network parameters into low-dimensional
subspaces, through mechanisms analogous to thermal diffusion in physical
systems. We analyze this property, establishing both a mathematical proof and a
physical interpretation. Extensive experiments on image classification
(CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and text classification (IMDB, Snips) tasks
demonstrate that KO consistently outperforms baseline optimizers (e.g., Adam,
SGD), achieving accuracy improvements while computation cost remains
comparable.

Abstract: Data engineering pipelines are essential - albeit costly - components of
predictive analytics frameworks requiring significant engineering time and
domain expertise for carrying out tasks such as data ingestion, preprocessing,
feature extraction, and feature engineering. In this paper, we propose ADEPT,
an automated data engineering pipeline via text embeddings. At the core of the
ADEPT framework is a simple yet powerful idea that the entropy of embeddings
corresponding to textually dense raw format representation of time series can
be intuitively viewed as equivalent (or in many cases superior) to that of
numerically dense vector representations obtained by data engineering
pipelines. Consequently, ADEPT uses a two step approach that (i) leverages text
embeddings to represent the diverse data sources, and (ii) constructs a
variational information bottleneck criteria to mitigate entropy variance in
text embeddings of time series data. ADEPT provides an end-to-end automated
implementation of predictive models that offers superior predictive performance
despite issues such as missing data, ill-formed records, improper or corrupted
data formats and irregular timestamps. Through exhaustive experiments, we show
that the ADEPT outperforms the best existing benchmarks in a diverse set of
datasets from large-scale applications across healthcare, finance, science and
industrial internet of things. Our results show that ADEPT can potentially
leapfrog many conventional data pipeline steps thereby paving the way for
efficient and scalable automation pathways for diverse data science
applications.

Conclusion: Kausal为非线性动态系统中的因果分析提供了有效工具，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We use a deep Koopman operator-theoretic formalism to develop a novel causal
discovery algorithm, Kausal. Causal discovery aims to identify cause-effect
mechanisms for better scientific understanding, explainable decision-making,
and more accurate modeling. Standard statistical frameworks, such as Granger
causality, lack the ability to quantify causal relationships in nonlinear
dynamics due to the presence of complex feedback mechanisms, timescale mixing,
and nonstationarity. This presents a challenge in studying many real-world
systems, such as the Earth's climate. Meanwhile, Koopman operator methods have
emerged as a promising tool for approximating nonlinear dynamics in a linear
space of observables. In Kausal, we propose to leverage this powerful idea for
causal analysis where optimal observables are inferred using deep learning.
Causal estimates are then evaluated in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and
defined as the distance between the marginal dynamics of the effect and the
joint dynamics of the cause-effect observables. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate Kausal's superior ability in discovering and characterizing causal
signals compared to existing approaches of prescribed observables. Lastly, we
extend our analysis to observations of El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation
highlighting our algorithm's applicability to real-world phenomena. Our code is

Abstract: Over the last two decades, machine learning models have been widely applied
and have proven effective in classifying variable stars, particularly with the
adoption of deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks,
recurrent neural networks, and transformer models. While these models have
achieved high accuracy, they require high-quality, representative data and a
large number of labelled samples for each star type to generalise well, which
can be challenging in time-domain surveys. This challenge often leads to models
learning and reinforcing biases inherent in the training data, an issue that is
not easily detectable when validation is performed on subsamples from the same
catalogue. The problem of biases in variable star data has been largely
overlooked, and a definitive solution has yet to be established. In this paper,
we propose a new approach to improve the reliability of classifiers in variable
star classification by introducing a self-regulated training process. This
process utilises synthetic samples generated by a physics-enhanced latent space
variational autoencoder, incorporating six physical parameters from Gaia Data
Release 3. Our method features a dynamic interaction between a classifier and a
generative model, where the generative model produces ad-hoc synthetic light
curves to reduce confusion during classifier training and populate
underrepresented regions in the physical parameter space. Experiments conducted
under various scenarios demonstrate that our self-regulated training approach
outperforms traditional training methods for classifying variable stars on
biased datasets, showing statistically significant improvements.

Conclusion: Variance-UCB为动态数据收集提供了一种高效且公平的解决方案。

Abstract: We study a fundamental learning problem over multiple groups with unknown
data distributions, where an analyst would like to learn the mean of each
group. Moreover, we want to ensure that this data is collected in a relatively
fair manner such that the noise of the estimate of each group is reasonable. In
particular, we focus on settings where data are collected dynamically, which is
important in adaptive experimentation for online platforms or adaptive clinical
trials for healthcare. In our model, we employ an active learning framework to
sequentially collect samples with bandit feedback, observing a sample in each
period from the chosen group. After observing a sample, the analyst updates
their estimate of the mean and variance of that group and chooses the next
group accordingly. The analyst's objective is to dynamically collect samples to
minimize the collective noise of the estimators, measured by the norm of the
vector of variances of the mean estimators.
  We propose an algorithm, Variance-UCB, that sequentially selects groups
according to an upper confidence bound on the variance estimate. We provide a
general theoretical framework for providing efficient bounds on learning from
any underlying distribution where the variances can be estimated reasonably.
This framework yields upper bounds on regret that improve significantly upon
all existing bounds, as well as a collection of new results for different
objectives and distributions than those previously studied.

Conclusion: 该方法为动态数据环境下的模型重新训练提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: A significant challenge in maintaining real-world machine learning models is
responding to the continuous and unpredictable evolution of data. Most
practitioners are faced with the difficult question: when should I retrain or
update my machine learning model? This seemingly straightforward problem is
particularly challenging for three reasons: 1) decisions must be made based on
very limited information - we usually have access to only a few examples, 2)
the nature, extent, and impact of the distribution shift are unknown, and 3) it
involves specifying a cost ratio between retraining and poor performance, which
can be hard to characterize. Existing works address certain aspects of this
problem, but none offer a comprehensive solution. Distribution shift detection
falls short as it cannot account for the cost trade-off; the scarcity of the
data, paired with its unusual structure, makes it a poor fit for existing
offline reinforcement learning methods, and the online learning formulation
overlooks key practical considerations. To address this, we present a
principled formulation of the retraining problem and propose an
uncertainty-based method that makes decisions by continually forecasting the
evolution of model performance evaluated with a bounded metric. Our experiments
addressing classification tasks show that the method consistently outperforms
existing baselines on 7 datasets.

Abstract: The growing enforcement of the right to be forgotten regulations has
propelled recent advances in certified (graph) unlearning strategies to comply
with data removal requests from deployed machine learning (ML) models.
Motivated by the well-documented bias amplification predicament inherent to
graph data, here we take a fresh look at graph unlearning and leverage it as a
bias mitigation tool. Given a pre-trained graph ML model, we develop a
training-free unlearning procedure that offers certifiable bias mitigation via
a single-step Newton update on the model weights. This way, we contribute a
computationally lightweight alternative to the prevalent training- and
optimization-based fairness enhancement approaches, with quantifiable
performance guarantees. We first develop a novel fairness-aware nodal feature
unlearning strategy along with refined certified unlearning bounds for this
setting, whose impact extends beyond the realm of graph unlearning. We then
design structural unlearning methods endowed with principled selection
mechanisms over nodes and edges informed by rigorous bias analyses. Unlearning
these judiciously selected elements can mitigate algorithmic biases with
minimal impact on downstream utility (e.g., node classification accuracy).
Experimental results over real networks corroborate the bias mitigation
efficacy of our unlearning strategies, and delineate markedly favorable
utility-complexity trade-offs relative to retraining from scratch using
augmented graph data obtained via removals.

Abstract: Selective classification enhances the reliability of predictive models by
allowing them to abstain from making uncertain predictions. In this work, we
revisit the design of optimal selection functions through the lens of the
Neyman--Pearson lemma, a classical result in statistics that characterizes the
optimal rejection rule as a likelihood ratio test. We show that this
perspective not only unifies the behavior of several post-hoc selection
baselines, but also motivates new approaches to selective classification which
we propose here. A central focus of our work is the setting of covariate shift,
where the input distribution at test time differs from that at training. This
realistic and challenging scenario remains relatively underexplored in the
context of selective classification. We evaluate our proposed methods across a
range of vision and language tasks, including both supervised learning and
vision-language models. Our experiments demonstrate that our
Neyman--Pearson-informed methods consistently outperform existing baselines,
indicating that likelihood ratio-based selection offers a robust mechanism for
improving selective classification under covariate shifts. Our code is publicly

Abstract: As a widely-used and practical tool, feature engineering transforms raw data
into discriminative features to advance AI model performance. However, existing
methods usually apply feature selection and generation separately, failing to
strive a balance between reducing redundancy and adding meaningful dimensions.
To fill this gap, we propose an agentic feature augmentation concept, where the
unification of feature generation and selection is modeled as agentic teaming
and planning. Specifically, we develop a Multi-Agent System with Long and
Short-Term Memory (MAGS), comprising a selector agent to eliminate redundant
features, a generator agent to produce informative new dimensions, and a router
agent that strategically coordinates their actions. We leverage in-context
learning with short-term memory for immediate feedback refinement and long-term
memory for globally optimal guidance. Additionally, we employ offline Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement fine-tuning to train the router agent
for effective decision-making to navigate a vast discrete feature space.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that this unified agentic framework
consistently achieves superior task performance by intelligently orchestrating
feature selection and generation.

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has demonstrated great promise for learning
generalizable graph representations from unlabeled data. However, conventional
GCL approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the restricted expressive
capacity of multilayer perceptron (MLP) based encoders, and (2) suboptimal
negative samples that either from random augmentations-failing to provide
effective 'hard negatives'-or generated hard negatives without addressing the
semantic distinctions crucial for discriminating graph data. To this end, we
propose Khan-GCL, a novel framework that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network (KAN) into the GCL encoder architecture, substantially enhancing its
representational capacity. Furthermore, we exploit the rich information
embedded within KAN coefficient parameters to develop two novel critical
feature identification techniques that enable the generation of semantically
meaningful hard negative samples for each graph representation. These
strategically constructed hard negatives guide the encoder to learn more
discriminative features by emphasizing critical semantic differences between
graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing GCL methods across a variety
of datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for graph analysis.
Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging learning framework to
collaboratively train graph data from various clients. However, since clients
are required to upload model parameters to the server in each round, this
provides the server with an opportunity to infer each client's data privacy. In
this paper, we focus on label distribution attacks(LDAs) that aim to infer the
label distributions of the clients' local data. We take the first step to
attack client's label distributions in FGL. Firstly, we observe that the
effectiveness of LDA is closely related to the variance of node embeddings in
GNNs. Next, we analyze the relation between them and we propose a new attack
named EC-LDA, which significantly improves the attack effectiveness by
compressing node embeddings. Thirdly, extensive experiments on node
classification and link prediction tasks across six widely used graph datasets
show that EC-LDA outperforms the SOTA LDAs. For example, EC-LDA attains optimal
values under both Cos-sim and JS-div evaluation metrics in the CoraFull and
LastFM datasets. Finally, we explore the robustness of EC-LDA under
differential privacy protection.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance across various
domains, yet they often struggle with model bias, particularly in the presence
of class imbalance. This bias can lead to suboptimal performance and unfair
predictions, especially for underrepresented classes. We introduce NeuBM
(Neutral Bias Mitigation), a novel approach to mitigate model bias in GNNs
through neutral input calibration. NeuBM leverages a dynamically updated
neutral graph to estimate and correct the inherent biases of the model. By
subtracting the logits obtained from the neutral graph from those of the input
graph, NeuBM effectively recalibrates the model's predictions, reducing bias
across different classes. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing GNN
architectures and training procedures, requiring minimal computational
overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
NeuBM significantly improves the balanced accuracy and recall of minority
classes, while maintaining strong overall performance. The effectiveness of
NeuBM is particularly pronounced in scenarios with severe class imbalance and
limited labeled data, where traditional methods often struggle. We provide
theoretical insights into how NeuBM achieves bias mitigation, relating it to
the concept of representation balancing. Our analysis reveals that NeuBM not
only adjusts the final predictions but also influences the learning of balanced
feature representations throughout the network.

Motivation: 现有GDRO算法只能处理固定样本量（1或m），无法适应动态变化的样本量场景，因此需要一种更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 将GDRO建模为两玩家博弈，提出新的PLA算法，构建损失估计器，并使用正则化领导者更新决策。

Conclusion: 新算法在动态样本量场景下表现优异，且样本复杂度与现有方法一致。

Abstract: Group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO) aims to develop models that
perform well across $m$ distributions simultaneously. Existing GDRO algorithms
can only process a fixed number of samples per iteration, either 1 or $m$, and
therefore can not support scenarios where the sample size varies dynamically.
To address this limitation, we investigate GDRO with flexible sample queries
and cast it as a two-player game: one player solves an online convex
optimization problem, while the other tackles a prediction with limited advice
(PLA) problem. Within such a game, we propose a novel PLA algorithm,
constructing appropriate loss estimators for cases where the sample size is
either 1 or not, and updating the decision using follow-the-regularized-leader.
Then, we establish the first high-probability regret bound for non-oblivious
PLA. Building upon the above approach, we develop a GDRO algorithm that allows
an arbitrary and varying sample size per round, achieving a high-probability
optimization error bound of $O\left(\frac{1}{t}\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^t
\frac{m}{r_j}\log m}\right)$, where $r_t$ denotes the sample size at round $t$.
This result demonstrates that the optimization error decreases as the number of
samples increases and implies a consistent sample complexity of $O(m\log
(m)/\epsilon^2)$ for any fixed sample size $r\in[m]$, aligning with existing
bounds for cases of $r=1$ or $m$. We validate our approach on synthetic binary
and real-world multi-class datasets.

Abstract: We introduce cumulative polynomial Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (CP-KAN), a

approach enables efficient degree selection across neurons while maintaining
computational tractability. The architecture performs well in regression tasks
with limited data, showing good robustness to input scales and natural
regularization properties from its polynomial basis. Additionally, theoretical
analysis establishes connections between CP-KAN's performance and properties of

Motivation: 高维动力系统中分界线的表征是一个挑战，现有工具主要关注稳定平衡点附近的行为。

Method: 结合Koopman理论和深度神经网络，近似与实正特征值相关的Koopman特征函数（KEFs），并通过优化方法定位分界线。

Result: 方法在合成基准、生态网络模型和神经科学任务中有效，并设计了最优扰动以预测系统行为。

Conclusion: 该框架为高维动力系统中分界线的表征提供了实用工具，尤其在神经科学中有潜在应用。

Abstract: Many natural systems, including neural circuits involved in decision making,
can be modeled as high-dimensional dynamical systems with multiple stable
states. While existing analytical tools primarily describe behavior near stable
equilibria, characterizing separatrices -- the manifolds that delineate
boundaries between different basins of attraction -- remains challenging,
particularly in high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce a numerical
framework leveraging Koopman Theory combined with Deep Neural Networks to
effectively characterize separatrices. Specifically, we approximate Koopman
Eigenfunctions (KEFs) associated with real positive eigenvalues, which vanish
precisely at the separatrices. Utilizing these scalar KEFs, optimization
methods efficiently locate separatrices even in complex systems. We demonstrate
our approach on synthetic benchmarks, ecological network models, and recurrent
neural networks trained on neuroscience-inspired tasks. Moreover, we illustrate
the practical utility of our method by designing optimal perturbations that can
shift systems across separatrices, enabling predictions relevant to optogenetic
stimulation experiments in neuroscience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VFL在5G核心网络中的性能因客户端（NWDAFs）可靠性问题而显著下降，需要一种新方法来优化特征分割和本地模型定义。

Result: 实验表明，该算法比传统基线方法性能更优。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了VFL在5G核心网络中的可靠性问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: This work proposes a new algorithm to mitigate model generalization loss in
Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) operating under client reliability
constraints within 5G Core Networks (CNs). Recently studied and endorsed by
3GPP, VFL enables collaborative and load-balanced model training and inference
across the CN. However, the performance of VFL significantly degrades when the
Network Data Analytics Functions (NWDAFs) - which serve as primary clients for
VFL model training and inference - experience reliability issues stemming from
resource constraints and operational overhead. Unlike edge environments, CN
environments adopt fundamentally different data management strategies,
characterized by more centralized data orchestration capabilities. This
presents opportunities to implement better distributed solutions that take full
advantage of the CN data handling flexibility. Leveraging this flexibility, we
propose a method that optimizes the vertical feature split among clients while
centrally defining their local models based on reliability metrics. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm,
showing improved performance over traditional baseline methods.

Conclusion: 结论表明结合谱截断的可逆单神经元网络为物理数据集学习紧凑且可解释的表示提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: Invertible neural architectures have recently attracted attention for their
compactness, interpretability, and information-preserving properties. In this
work, we propose the Fourier-Invertible Neural Encoder (FINE), which combines
invertible monotonic activation functions with reversible filter structures,
and could be extended using Invertible ResNets. This architecture is examined
in learning low-dimensional representations of one-dimensional nonlinear wave
interactions and exact circular translation symmetry. Dimensionality is
preserved across layers, except for a Fourier truncation step in the latent
space, which enables dimensionality reduction while maintaining shift
equivariance and interpretability. Our results demonstrate that FINE
significantly outperforms classical linear methods such as Discrete Fourier
Transformation (DFT) and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and achieves
reconstruction accuracy better than conventional deep autoencoders with
convolutional layers (CNN) - while using substantially smaller models and
offering superior physical interpretability. These findings suggest that
invertible single-neuron networks, when combined with spectral truncation,
offer a promising framework for learning compact and interpretable
representations of physics datasets, and symmetry-aware representation learning
in physics-informed machine learning.

Abstract: Time series forecasting models often produce systematic, predictable errors
even in critical domains such as energy, finance, and healthcare. We introduce
a novel post training adaptive optimization framework that improves forecast
accuracy without retraining or architectural changes. Our method automatically
applies expressive transformations optimized via reinforcement learning,
contextual bandits, or genetic algorithms to correct model outputs in a
lightweight and model agnostic way. Theoretically, we prove that affine
corrections always reduce the mean squared error; practically, we extend this
idea with dynamic action based optimization. The framework also supports an
optional human in the loop component: domain experts can guide corrections
using natural language, which is parsed into actions by a language model.
Across multiple benchmarks (e.g., electricity, weather, traffic), we observe
consistent accuracy gains with minimal computational overhead. Our interactive
demo shows the framework's real time usability. By combining automated post hoc
refinement with interpretable and extensible mechanisms, our approach offers a
powerful new direction for practical forecasting systems.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces critical challenges, particularly in
heterogeneous environments where non-independent and identically distributed
data across clients can lead to unfair and inefficient model performance. In
this work, we introduce \textit{DRDM}, a novel algorithm that addresses these
issues by combining a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework with
dynamic regularization to mitigate client drift. \textit{DRDM} frames the
training as a min-max optimization problem aimed at maximizing performance for
the worst-case client, thereby promoting robustness and fairness. This robust
objective is optimized through an algorithm leveraging dynamic regularization
and efficient local updates, which significantly reduces the required number of
communication rounds. Moreover, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis
for convex smooth objectives under partial participation. Extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets, covering various model architectures and data
heterogeneity levels, demonstrate that \textit{DRDM} significantly improves
worst-case test accuracy while requiring fewer communication rounds than
existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bandwidth on the energy consumption of
participating clients, demonstrating that the number of local update steps can
be adaptively selected to achieve a target worst-case test accuracy with
minimal total energy cost across diverse communication environments.

Abstract: Integer quantization has emerged as a critical technique to facilitate
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Although they do reduce the
complexity of the learning models, their inference performance is often prone
to quantization-induced errors. To this end, we introduce InTreeger: an
end-to-end framework that takes a training dataset as input, and outputs an
architecture-agnostic integer-only C implementation of tree-based machine
learning model, without loss of precision. This framework enables anyone, even
those without prior experience in machine learning, to generate a highly
optimized integer-only classification model that can run on any hardware simply
by providing an input dataset and target variable. We evaluated our generated
implementations across three different architectures (ARM, x86, and RISC-V),
resulting in significant improvements in inference latency. In addition, we
show the energy efficiency compared to typical decision tree implementations
that rely on floating-point arithmetic. The results underscore the advantages
of integer-only inference, making it particularly suitable for energy- and
area-constrained devices such as embedded systems and edge computing platforms,
while also enabling the execution of decision trees on existing ultra-low power
devices.

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective at modeling
relational data, pairwise connections cannot fully capture multi-way
relationships naturally present in complex real-world systems. In response to
this, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial
representations -- such as simplicial or cellular complexes -- to accommodate
higher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through
Higher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \emph{scalability
challenges} due to \textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing
routes, and \textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation
mechanism. To overcome these limitations, we propose HOPSE (Higher-Order
Positional and Structural Encoder) -- a \emph{message passing-free} framework
that uses Hasse graph decompositions to derive efficient and expressive
encodings over \emph{arbitrary higher-order domains}. Notably, HOPSE scales
linearly with dataset size while preserving expressive power and permutation
equivariance. Experiments on molecular, expressivity and topological benchmarks
show that HOPSE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while
achieving up to 7 $times$ speedups over HOMP-based models, opening a new path
for scalable TDL.

Abstract: Low-rank regularization (LRR) has been widely applied in various machine
learning tasks, but the associated optimization is challenging. Directly
optimizing the rank function under constraints is NP-hard in general. To
overcome this difficulty, various relaxations of the rank function were
studied. However, optimization of these relaxed LRRs typically depends on
singular value decomposition, which is a time-consuming and nondifferentiable
operator that cannot be optimized with gradient-based techniques. To address
these challenges, in this paper we propose an efficient differentiable
approximation of the generalized LRR. The considered LRR form subsumes many
popular choices like the nuclear norm, the Schatten-$p$ norm, and various
nonconvex relaxations. Our method enables LRR terms to be appended to loss
functions in a plug-and-play fashion, and the GPU-friendly operations enable
efficient and convenient implementation. Furthermore, convergence analysis is
presented, which rigorously shows that both the bias and the variance of our
rank estimator rapidly reduce with increased sample size and iteration steps.
In the experimental study, the proposed method is applied to various tasks,
which demonstrates its versatility and efficiency. Code is available at

This approach preserves the transparency of linear models while flexibly

SplitWise is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results
show that it consistently produces more parsimonious and generalizable models
than traditional stepwise and penalized regression techniques.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various applications,

trajectories can significantly impact clinical decision-making. Ensuring
transparency and explainability of the models responsible for these tasks is
essential for their adoption in critical settings. Recent work has explored a
top-down approach to bi-level transparency, focusing on understanding trends

extend this framework by incorporating exogenous time series features alongside
static features in a structured manner, while maintaining cohesive
interpretation. Our approach leverages the insights of trajectory comprehension
to introduce an encoding mechanism for exogenous time series, where they are
decomposed into meaningful trends and properties, enabling the extraction of
interpretable patterns. Through experiments on several synthetic datasets, we

Abstract: We present new fast-rate generalization bounds for multi-task and
meta-learning in the unbalanced setting, i.e. when the tasks have training sets
of different sizes, as is typically the case in real-world scenarios.
Previously, only standard-rate bounds were known for this situation, while
fast-rate bounds were limited to the setting where all training sets are of
equal size. Our new bounds are numerically computable as well as interpretable,
and we demonstrate their flexibility in handling a number of cases where they
give stronger guarantees than previous bounds. Besides the bounds themselves,
we also make conceptual contributions: we demonstrate that the unbalanced
multi-task setting has different statistical properties than the balanced
situation, specifically that proofs from the balanced situation do not carry
over to the unbalanced setting. Additionally, we shed light on the fact that
the unbalanced situation allows two meaningful definitions of multi-task risk,
depending on whether if all tasks should be considered equally important or if
sample-rich tasks should receive more weight than sample-poor ones.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning has emerged as a popular approach to training
on devices holding statistically heterogeneous data, known as clients. However,
most existing approaches require a client to have labeled data for training or
finetuning in order to obtain their own personalized model. In this paper we
address this by proposing FLowDUP, a novel method that is able to generate a
personalized model using only a forward pass with unlabeled data. The generated
model parameters reside in a low-dimensional subspace, enabling efficient
communication and computation. FLowDUP's learning objective is theoretically
motivated by our new transductive multi-task PAC-Bayesian generalization bound,
that provides performance guarantees for unlabeled clients. The objective is
structured in such a way that it allows both clients with labeled data and
clients with only unlabeled data to contribute to the training process. To
supplement our theoretical results we carry out a thorough experimental
evaluation of FLowDUP, demonstrating strong empirical performance on a range of
datasets with differing sorts of statistically heterogeneous clients. Through
numerous ablation studies, we test the efficacy of the individual components of
the method.

work is establishing a novel connection between OBS and portfolio selection,
bridging Bayesian ensemble learning with a rich, well-studied theoretical
framework that offers efficient algorithms and extensive regret analysis. We

Conclusion: 该框架避免了二阶信息或额外DP-SOSP识别需求，显著提升了DP优化问题的实用性和分布式性能。

Abstract: We investigate the problem of finding second-order stationary points (SOSP)
in differentially private (DP) stochastic non-convex optimization. Existing
methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) inaccurate convergence error rate
due to overlooking gradient variance in the saddle point escape analysis, and
(ii) dependence on auxiliary private model selection procedures for identifying
DP-SOSP, which can significantly impair utility, particularly in distributed
settings. To address these issues, we propose a generic perturbed stochastic
gradient descent (PSGD) framework built upon Gaussian noise injection and
general gradient oracles. A core innovation of our framework is using model
drift distance to determine whether PSGD escapes saddle points, ensuring
convergence to approximate local minima without relying on second-order
information or additional DP-SOSP identification. By leveraging the adaptive
DP-SPIDER estimator as a specific gradient oracle, we develop a new DP
algorithm that rectifies the convergence error rates reported in prior work. We
further extend this algorithm to distributed learning with arbitrarily

Motivation: 当前多表数据生成方法难以捕捉复杂的关系结构，尤其是长距离依赖和多外键关系。

Conclusion: 该方法灵活且表达力强，能够支持复杂结构的关系数据集。

Abstract: Data synthesis is gaining momentum as a privacy-enhancing technology. While
single-table tabular data generation has seen considerable progress, current
methods for multi-table data often lack the flexibility and expressiveness
needed to capture complex relational structures. In particular, they struggle
with long-range dependencies and complex foreign-key relationships, such as
tables with multiple parent tables or multiple types of links between the same
pair of tables. We propose a generative model for relational data that
generates the content of a relational dataset given the graph formed by the
foreign-key relationships. We do this by learning a deep generative model of
the content of the whole relational database by flow matching, where the neural
network trained to denoise records leverages a graph neural network to obtain
information from connected records. Our method is flexible, as it can support
relational datasets with complex structures, and expressive, as the generation
of each record can be influenced by any other record within the same connected
component. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that
it achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of synthetic data fidelity.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种本地差分隐私（LDP）方法，用于在标签被扰动的情况下实现保形预测（CP），确保预测集的真实类别覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决隐私敏感场景下，聚合器不可信且只能访问扰动标签时，保形预测的适用性问题。

Method: 1. 用户提供输入特征和扰动标签（k-ary随机响应）；2. 用户对一致性分数加噪（二分搜索响应）。两种方法均直接从噪声数据计算保形阈值。

Result: 证明了有限样本覆盖率保证，并在严重随机化下仍保持稳健覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该方法将强本地隐私与预测不确定性控制结合，适用于敏感应用（如医疗影像或大语言模型查询）。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides sets of candidate classes with a
guaranteed probability of containing the true class. However, it typically
relies on a calibration set with clean labels. We address privacy-sensitive
scenarios where the aggregator is untrusted and can only access a perturbed
version of the true labels. We propose two complementary approaches under local
differential privacy (LDP). In the first approach, users do not access the
model but instead provide their input features and a perturbed label using a
k-ary randomized response. In the second approach, which enforces stricter
privacy constraints, users add noise to their conformity score by binary search
response. This method requires access to the classification model but preserves
both data and label privacy. Both approaches compute the conformal threshold
directly from noisy data without accessing the true labels. We prove
finite-sample coverage guarantees and demonstrate robust coverage even under
severe randomization. This approach unifies strong local privacy with
predictive uncertainty control, making it well-suited for sensitive
applications such as medical imaging or large language model queries,
regardless of whether users can (or are willing to) compute their own scores.

Conclusion: HTGN有效解决了高阶结构建模和效率问题，提升了时序图学习的性能。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have gained growing attention for
modeling and predicting structures in temporal graphs. However, existing TGNNs
primarily focus on pairwise interactions while overlooking higher-order
structures that are integral to link formation and evolution in real-world
temporal graphs. Meanwhile, these models often suffer from efficiency
bottlenecks, further limiting their expressive power. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Higher-order structure Temporal Graph Neural Network,
which incorporates hypergraph representations into temporal graph learning. In
particular, we develop an algorithm to identify the underlying higher-order
structures, enhancing the model's ability to capture the group interactions.
Furthermore, by aggregating multiple edge features into hyperedge
representations, HTGN effectively reduces memory cost during training. We
theoretically demonstrate the enhanced expressiveness of our approach and
validate its effectiveness and efficiency through extensive experiments on
various real-world temporal graphs. Experimental results show that HTGN
achieves superior performance on dynamic link prediction while reducing memory
costs by up to 50\% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: BraInCoRL为视觉皮层建模提供了一种高效、可扩展且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Understanding functional representations within higher visual cortex is a
fundamental question in computational neuroscience. While artificial neural
networks pretrained on large-scale datasets exhibit striking representational
alignment with human neural responses, learning image-computable models of
visual cortex relies on individual-level, large-scale fMRI datasets. The
necessity for expensive, time-intensive, and often impractical data acquisition
limits the generalizability of encoders to new subjects and stimuli. BraInCoRL
uses in-context learning to predict voxelwise neural responses from few-shot
examples without any additional finetuning for novel subjects and stimuli. We
leverage a transformer architecture that can flexibly condition on a variable
number of in-context image stimuli, learning an inductive bias over multiple
subjects. During training, we explicitly optimize the model for in-context
learning. By jointly conditioning on image features and voxel activations, our
model learns to directly generate better performing voxelwise models of higher
visual cortex. We demonstrate that BraInCoRL consistently outperforms existing
voxelwise encoder designs in a low-data regime when evaluated on entirely novel
images, while also exhibiting strong test-time scaling behavior. The model also
generalizes to an entirely new visual fMRI dataset, which uses different
subjects and fMRI data acquisition parameters. Further, BraInCoRL facilitates
better interpretability of neural signals in higher visual cortex by attending
to semantically relevant stimuli. Finally, we show that our framework enables
interpretable mappings from natural language queries to voxel selectivity.

Conclusion: LOBSTUR-GNN为无监督GNN提供了一种可靠的超参数调优方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in conjunction with
unsupervised learning techniques to learn powerful node representations, but
their deployment is hindered by their high sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning
and the absence of established methodologies for selecting the optimal models.
To address these challenges, we propose LOBSTUR-GNN ({\bf Lo}cal {\bf B}oot{\bf
s}trap for {\bf T}uning {\bf U}nsupervised {\bf R}epresentations in GNNs) i), a
novel framework designed to adapt bootstrapping techniques for unsupervised
graph representation learning. LOBSTUR-GNN tackles two main challenges: (a)
adapting the bootstrap edge and feature resampling process to account for local
graph dependencies in creating alternative versions of the same graph, and (b)
establishing robust metrics for evaluating learned representations without
ground-truth labels. Using locally bootstrapped resampling and leveraging
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to assess embedding consistency, LOBSTUR
provides a principled approach for hyperparameter tuning in unsupervised GNNs.
We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method through
extensive experiments on established academic datasets, showing an 65.9\%
improvement in the classification accuracy compared to an uninformed selection
of hyperparameters. Finally, we deploy our framework on a real-world
application, thereby demonstrating its validity and practical utility in
various settings. \footnote{The code is available at

Abstract: Generalizing control policies to novel embodiments remains a fundamental
challenge in enabling scalable and transferable learning in robotics. While
prior works have explored this in locomotion, a systematic study in the context
of manipulation tasks remains limited, partly due to the lack of standardized
benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for learning
cross-embodiment manipulation, focusing on two foundational tasks-reach and
push-across a diverse range of morphologies. The benchmark is designed to test
generalization along three axes: interpolation (testing performance within a
robot category that shares the same link structure), extrapolation (testing on
a robot with a different link structure), and composition (testing on
combinations of link structures). On the benchmark, we evaluate the ability of
different RL policies to learn from multiple morphologies and to generalize to
novel ones. Our study aims to answer whether morphology-aware training can
outperform single-embodiment baselines, whether zero-shot generalization to
unseen morphologies is feasible, and how consistently these patterns hold
across different generalization regimes. The results highlight the current
limitations of multi-embodiment learning and provide insights into how
architectural and training design choices influence policy generalization.

Abstract: Protein fitness optimization involves finding a protein sequence that
maximizes desired quantitative properties in a combinatorially large design
space of possible sequences. Recent developments in steering protein generative
models (e.g diffusion models, language models) offer a promising approach.
However, by and large, past studies have optimized surrogate rewards and/or
utilized large amounts of labeled data for steering, making it unclear how well
existing methods perform and compare to each other in real-world optimization
campaigns where fitness is measured by low-throughput wet-lab assays. In this
study, we explore fitness optimization using small amounts (hundreds) of
labeled sequence-fitness pairs and comprehensively evaluate strategies such as
classifier guidance and posterior sampling for guiding generation from
different discrete diffusion models of protein sequences. We also demonstrate
how guidance can be integrated into adaptive sequence selection akin to
Thompson sampling in Bayesian optimization, showing that plug-and-play guidance
strategies offer advantages compared to alternatives such as reinforcement
learning with protein language models.

Abstract: Robots in the real world need to perceive and move to goals in complex

when relying on sensor perception and when goals are among clutter. Diffusion
policies and other generative models have shown strong performance in solving
local planning problems, but often struggle at avoiding all of the subtle
constraint violations that characterize truly challenging global motion
planning problems. In this work, we propose an approach for learning global
motion planning using diffusion policies, allowing the robot to generate full
trajectories through complex scenes and reasoning about multiple obstacles
along the path. Our approach uses cascaded hierarchical models which unify
global prediction and local refinement together with online plan repair to
ensure the trajectories are collision free. Our method outperforms (by ~5%) a
wide variety of baselines on challenging tasks in multiple domains including
navigation and manipulation.

Abstract: We investigate the theoretical foundations of data poisoning attacks in

spectral signatures that characterize compromised datasets. We use random
matrix theory (RMT) to develop a theory for the impact of poisoning proportion
and regularisation on attack efficacy in linear regression. Through QR stepwise
regression, we study the spectral signatures of the Hessian in multi-output
regression. We perform experiments on deep networks to show experimentally that
this theory extends to modern convolutional and transformer networks under the
cross-entropy loss. Based on these insights we develop preliminary algorithms
to determine if a network has been poisoned and remedies which do not require
further training.

Abstract: We study the policy testing problem in discounted Markov decision processes
(MDPs) under the fixed-confidence setting. The goal is to determine whether the
value of a given policy exceeds a specified threshold while minimizing the
number of observations. We begin by deriving an instance-specific lower bound
that any algorithm must satisfy. This lower bound is characterized as the
solution to an optimization problem with non-convex constraints. We propose a
policy testing algorithm inspired by this optimization problem--a common
approach in pure exploration problems such as best-arm identification, where
asymptotically optimal algorithms often stem from such optimization-based
characterizations. As for other pure exploration tasks in MDPs, however, the
non-convex constraints in the lower-bound problem present significant
challenges, raising doubts about whether statistically optimal and
computationally tractable algorithms can be designed. To address this, we
reformulate the lower-bound problem by interchanging the roles of the objective
and the constraints, yielding an alternative problem with a non-convex
objective but convex constraints. Strikingly, this reformulated problem admits
an interpretation as a policy optimization task in a newly constructed reversed
MDP. Leveraging recent advances in policy gradient methods, we efficiently
solve this problem and use it to design a policy testing algorithm that is
statistically optimal--matching the instance-specific lower bound on sample
complexity--while remaining computationally tractable. We validate our approach
with numerical experiments.

Abstract: Conformal prediction enables the construction of high-coverage prediction

Experiments on several challenging image classification datasets demonstrate

with a CSP generator that ensures safe and competent behavior, then
incrementally personalizes behavior by learning parameterized constraints from
online interaction. By quantifying uncertainty and leveraging the
compositionality of planning constraints, CBTL achieves sample-efficient
adaptation without environment resets. We evaluate CBTL in (1) three diverse
simulation environments; (2) a web-based user study; and (3) a real-robot
assisted feeding system, finding that CBTL consistently achieves more effective
personalization with fewer interactions than baselines. Our results demonstrate
that CBTL provides a unified and practical approach for continual, flexible,

Abstract: Nearest neighbor search is central in machine learning, information

such as HNSW, DiskANN, and NSG have become popular thanks to their empirical
accuracy and efficiency. These methods construct a directed graph over the
dataset and perform beam search on the graph to find nodes close to a given
query. While significant work has focused on practical refinements and
theoretical understanding of graph-based methods, many questions remain. We
propose a new distance-based termination condition for beam search to replace
the commonly used condition based on beam width. We prove that, as long as the
search graph is navigable, our resulting Adaptive Beam Search method is
guaranteed to approximately solve the nearest-neighbor problem, establishing a
connection between navigability and the performance of graph-based search. We
also provide extensive experiments on our new termination condition for both
navigable graphs and approximately navigable graphs used in practice, such as
HNSW and Vamana graphs. We find that Adaptive Beam Search outperforms standard
beam search over a range of recall values, data sets, graph constructions, and
target number of nearest neighbors. It thus provides a simple and practical way

suitability of composites in specific applications, finite element (FE)
modelling, a numerical method based on partial differential equations, is the
industry standard for assessing their mechanical properties. However, FE
modelling is exceptionally costly from a computational viewpoint, a limitation
which has led to efforts towards applying AI models to this task. However, in
these approaches: the chosen model architectures were rudimentary, feed-forward
neural networks giving limited accuracy; the studies focus on predicting
elastic mechanical properties, without considering material strength limits;
and the models lacked transparency, hindering trustworthiness by users. In this
paper, we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) equipped with methods
from explainable AI (XAI) can be successfully deployed to solve this problem.
Our approach uses customised CNNs trained on a dataset we generate using
transverse tension tests in FE modelling to predict composites' mechanical
properties, i.e., Young's modulus and yield strength. We show empirically that
our approach achieves high accuracy, outperforming a baseline, ResNet-34, in
estimating the mechanical properties. We then use SHAP and Integrated
Gradients, two post-hoc XAI methods, to explain the predictions, showing that
the CNNs use the critical geometrical features that influence the composites'
behaviour, thus allowing engineers to verify that the models are trustworthy by
representing the science of composites.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了深度学习模型，用于提前六小时预测急诊科（ED）的候诊患者数量，支持基于非临床数据的主动决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过非临床数据预测急诊科候诊患者数量，以优化医院运营决策。

Method: 使用多种时间序列深度学习模型（如ResNetPlus、TSTPlus、TSiTPlus和N-BEATSx），结合Optuna和网格搜索进行超参数调优。

Result: N-BEATSx表现最佳，平均绝对误差为2.10，决定系数为0.95，且在极端情况下仍保持稳定。

Conclusion: 研究表明，无需临床数据即可实现高精度预测，为医院系统提供了一种通用框架。

Abstract: This study develops deep learning models to forecast the number of patients
in the emergency department (ED) boarding phase six hours in advance, aiming to
support proactive operational decision-making using only non-clinical,
operational, and contextual features. Data were collected from five sources: ED
tracking systems, inpatient census records, weather reports, federal holiday
calendars, and local event schedules. After feature engineering, the data were
aggregated at an hourly level, cleaned, and merged into a unified dataset for
model training. Several time series deep learning models, including ResNetPlus,
TSTPlus, TSiTPlus (from the tsai library), and N-BEATSx, were trained using
Optuna and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. The average ED boarding count
was 28.7, with a standard deviation of 11.2. N-BEATSx achieved the best
performance, with a mean absolute error of 2.10, mean squared error of 7.08,
root mean squared error of 2.66, and a coefficient of determination of 0.95.
The model maintained stable accuracy even during periods of extremely high
boarding counts, defined as values exceeding one, two, or three standard
deviations above the mean. Results show that accurate six-hour-ahead forecasts
are achievable without using patient-level clinical data. While strong
performance was observed even with a basic feature set, the inclusion of
additional features improved prediction stability under extreme conditions.
This framework offers a practical and generalizable approach for hospital
systems to anticipate boarding levels and help mitigate ED overcrowding.

Method: SurvUnc采用基于锚点的学习策略，将一致性知识融入元模型优化，通过成对排序性能有效估计不确定性。该框架与任何生存模型兼容，无需修改其架构或访问内部参数。

Conclusion: SurvUnc显著提升了生存模型的解释性和可靠性，为实际应用中的可信预测铺平了道路。

Abstract: Survival analysis, which estimates the probability of event occurrence over
time from censored data, is fundamental in numerous real-world applications,
particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and risk assessment.
Despite advances in numerous survival models, quantifying the uncertainty of
predictions from these models remains underexplored and challenging. The lack
of reliable uncertainty quantification limits the interpretability and
trustworthiness of survival models, hindering their adoption in clinical
decision-making and other sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, in this
work, we introduce SurvUnc, a novel meta-model based framework for post-hoc
uncertainty quantification for survival models. SurvUnc introduces an
anchor-based learning strategy that integrates concordance knowledge into
meta-model optimization, leveraging pairwise ranking performance to estimate
uncertainty effectively. Notably, our framework is model-agnostic, ensuring
compatibility with any survival model without requiring modifications to its
architecture or access to its internal parameters. Especially, we design a
comprehensive evaluation pipeline tailored to this critical yet overlooked
problem. Through extensive experiments on four publicly available benchmarking
datasets and five representative survival models, we demonstrate the
superiority of SurvUnc across multiple evaluation scenarios, including
selective prediction, misprediction detection, and out-of-domain detection. Our
results highlight the effectiveness of SurvUnc in enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, paving the way for more trustworthy survival
predictions in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列方法只能揭示时间平均意义上的因果关系，而ACI旨在解决瞬时因果关系和动态演化的识别问题。

Method: ACI利用动态系统和贝叶斯数据同化技术，通过逆向问题解决因果关系，评估效应变量信息是否减少潜在原因变量的不确定性。

Result: ACI能够捕捉变量动态交互、无需经验阈值确定CIR，适用于高维问题和短时间序列，且无需观测候选原因。

Conclusion: ACI在复杂动态系统中表现出色，尤其在间歇性和极端事件中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Causal inference determines cause-and-effect relationships between variables
and has broad applications across disciplines. Traditional time-series methods
often reveal causal links only in a time-averaged sense, while ensemble-based
information transfer approaches detect the time evolution of short-term causal
relationships but are typically limited to low-dimensional systems. In this
paper, a new causal inference framework, called assimilative causal inference
(ACI), is developed. Fundamentally different from the state-of-the-art methods,
ACI uses a dynamical system and a single realization of a subset of the state
variables to identify instantaneous causal relationships and the dynamic
evolution of the associated causal influence range (CIR). Instead of
quantifying how causes influence effects as done traditionally, ACI solves an
inverse problem via Bayesian data assimilation, thus tracing causes backward
from observed effects with an implicit Bayesian hypothesis. Causality is
determined by assessing whether incorporating the information of the effect
variables reduces the uncertainty in recovering the potential cause variables.
ACI has several desirable features. First, it captures the dynamic interplay of
variables, where their roles as causes and effects can shift repeatedly over
time. Second, a mathematically justified objective criterion determines the CIR
without empirical thresholds. Third, ACI is scalable to high-dimensional
problems by leveraging computationally efficient Bayesian data assimilation
techniques. Finally, ACI applies to short time series and incomplete datasets.
Notably, ACI does not require observations of candidate causes, which is a key
advantage since potential drivers are often unknown or unmeasured. The
effectiveness of ACI is demonstrated by complex dynamical systems showcasing
intermittency and extreme events.

Result: 实验显示MCW比微调提升7.9%，比MMD-CORAL提升2.2%，且在不同训练样本量下均表现稳健。

Conclusion: MCW方法在电力变压器故障诊断中有效解决了分布偏移问题，提升了诊断准确性。

Abstract: Ensuring the reliable operation of power transformers is critical to grid
stability. Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is widely used for fault diagnosis, but
traditional methods rely on heuristic rules, which may lead to inconsistent
results. Machine learning (ML)-based approaches have improved diagnostic
accuracy; however, power transformers operate under varying conditions, and
differences in transformer type, environmental factors, and operational
settings create distribution shifts in diagnostic data. Consequently, direct
model transfer between transformers often fails, making techniques for domain
adaptation a necessity. To tackle this issue, this work proposes a
feature-weighted domain adaptation technique that combines Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) and Correlation Alignment (CORAL) with feature-specific
weighting (MCW). Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistics are used to assign
adaptable weights, prioritizing features with larger distributional
discrepancies and thereby improving source and target domain alignment.
Experimental evaluations on datasets for power transformers demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves a 7.9% improvement over
Fine-Tuning and a 2.2% improvement over MMD-CORAL (MC). Furthermore, it
outperforms both techniques across various training sample sizes, confirming
its robustness for domain adaptation.

Motivation: 滚动轴承的RUL预测对工业系统安全性和效率至关重要，但降解趋势复杂、噪声干扰和早期故障检测需求使其成为挑战。

Method: 采用小波包分解（WPD）去噪，结合定制多通道Swin Transformer模型（MCSFormer），利用注意力机制融合特征，并设计定制损失函数以区分早期和晚期预测。

Result: 在PRONOSTIA数据集上，MCSFormer在MAE指标上优于现有模型（如Adaptive Transformer、MDAN、CNN-SRU），泛化能力优于ViT和Swin Transformer，定制损失函数显著减少晚期预测。

Conclusion: MCSFormer是一种可信赖且高效的工业预测性维护工具，具有强噪声抵抗能力、泛化能力和安全性。

Abstract: Precise estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of rolling bearings is
an important consideration to avoid unexpected failures, reduce downtime, and
promote safety and efficiency in industrial systems. Complications in
degradation trends, noise presence, and the necessity to detect faults in
advance make estimation of RUL a challenging task. This paper introduces a
novel framework that combines wavelet-based denoising method, Wavelet Packet
Decomposition (WPD), and a customized multi-channel Swin Transformer model
(MCSFormer) to address these problems. With attention mechanisms incorporated
for feature fusion, the model is designed to learn global and local degradation
patterns utilizing hierarchical representations for enhancing predictive
performance. Additionally, a customized loss function is developed as a key
distinction of this work to differentiate between early and late predictions,
prioritizing accurate early detection and minimizing the high operation risks
of late predictions. The proposed model was evaluated with the PRONOSTIA
dataset using three experiments. Intra-condition experiments demonstrated that
MCSFormer outperformed state-of-the-art models, including the Adaptive
Transformer, MDAN, and CNN-SRU, achieving 41%, 64%, and 69% lower MAE on
average across different operating conditions, respectively. In terms of
cross-condition testing, it achieved superior generalization under varying
operating conditions compared to the adapted ViT and Swin Transformer. Lastly,
the custom loss function effectively reduced late predictions, as evidenced in
a 6.3% improvement in the scoring metric while maintaining competitive overall
performance. The model's robust noise resistance, generalization capability,
and focus on safety make MCSFormer a trustworthy and effective predictive
maintenance tool in industrial applications.

Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, accurately predicting the conversion rate
(CVR) is crucial for enhancing advertising efficiency and user satisfaction.
This paper addresses the challenge of CVR prediction while adhering to user
privacy preferences and advertiser requirements. Traditional methods face
obstacles such as the reluctance of advertisers to share sensitive conversion
data and the limitations of model training in secure environments like data
clean rooms. We propose a novel model training framework that enables
collaborative model training without sharing sample-level gradients with the
advertising platform. Our approach introduces several innovative components:
(1) utilizing batch-level aggregated gradients instead of sample-level
gradients to minimize privacy risks; (2) applying adapter-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning and gradient compression to reduce
communication costs; and (3) employing de-biasing techniques to train the model
under label differential privacy, thereby maintaining accuracy despite
privacy-enhanced label perturbations. Our experimental results, conducted on
industrial datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves competitive ROCAUC
performance while significantly decreasing communication overhead and complying
with both advertiser privacy requirements and user privacy choices. This
framework establishes a new standard for privacy-preserving, high-performance
CVR prediction in the digital advertising landscape.

Abstract: Conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aggregate neighbor embeddings as
holistic vectors, lacking the ability to identify fine-grained,
direction-specific feature relevance. We propose MSH-GNN (Multi-Scale Harmonic
Graph Neural Network), a novel architecture that performs feature-wise adaptive
message passing through node-specific harmonic projections. For each node,
MSH-GNN dynamically projects neighbor features onto frequency-sensitive
directions determined by the target node's own representation. These
projections are further modulated using learnable sinusoidal encodings at
multiple frequencies, enabling the model to capture both smooth and oscillatory
structural patterns across scales. A frequency-aware attention pooling
mechanism is introduced to emphasize spectrally and structurally salient nodes
during readout. Theoretically, we prove that MSH-GNN approximates
shift-invariant kernels and matches the expressive power of the
1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Empirically, MSH-GNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models on a wide range of graph and node classification tasks.
Furthermore, in challenging classification settings involving joint variations
in graph topology and spectral frequency, MSH-GNN excels at capturing
structural asymmetries and high-frequency modulations, enabling more accurate

OOD graph samples: \textit{OOD samples often exhibit anomalous spectral gaps
(the difference between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues)}. This
observation motivates us to propose SpecGap, an effective post-hoc approach for
OOD detection on graphs. SpecGap adjusts features by subtracting the component
associated with the second-largest eigenvalue, scaled by the spectral gap, from
the high-level features (i.e., $\mathbf{X}-\left(\lambda_n-\lambda_{n-1}\right)
\mathbf{u}_{n-1} \mathbf{v}_{n-1}^T$). SpecGap achieves state-of-the-art

Abstract: Fuzzy rough feature selection (FRFS) is an effective means of addressing the
curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional data. By removing redundant and
irrelevant features, FRFS helps mitigate classifier overfitting, enhance
generalization performance, and lessen computational overhead. However, most
existing FRFS algorithms primarily focus on reducing uncertainty in pattern
classification, neglecting that lower uncertainty does not necessarily result
in improved classification performance, despite it commonly being regarded as a
key indicator of feature selection effectiveness in the FRFS literature. To
bridge uncertainty characterization and pattern classification, we propose a
Margin-aware Fuzzy Rough Feature Selection (MAFRFS) framework that considers
both the compactness and separation of label classes. MAFRFS effectively
reduces uncertainty in pattern classification tasks, while guiding the feature
selection towards more separable and discriminative label class structures.
Extensive experiments on 15 public datasets demonstrate that MAFRFS is highly
scalable and more effective than FRFS. The algorithms developed using MAFRFS
outperform six state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms.

how the fast pace of progress around the topics of oversmoothing and

with the consolidation of commonly accepted beliefs and assumptions that are
not always true nor easy to distinguish from each other. We argue that this has

Abstract: The rise of IoT has increased the need for on-edge machine learning, with
TinyML emerging as a promising solution for resource-constrained devices such
as MCU. However, evaluating their performance remains challenging due to
diverse architectures and application scenarios. Current solutions have many
non-negligible limitations. This work introduces an alternative benchmarking
methodology that integrates energy and latency measurements while
distinguishing three execution phases pre-inference, inference, and
post-inference. Additionally, the setup ensures that the device operates
without being powered by an external measurement unit, while automated testing
can be leveraged to enhance statistical significance. To evaluate our setup, we
tested the STM32N6 MCU, which includes a NPU for executing neural networks. Two
configurations were considered: high-performance and Low-power. The variation
of the EDP was analyzed separately for each phase, providing insights into the
impact of hardware configurations on energy efficiency. Each model was tested
1000 times to ensure statistically relevant results. Our findings demonstrate
that reducing the core voltage and clock frequency improve the efficiency of
pre- and post-processing without significantly affecting network execution
performance. This approach can also be used for cross-platform comparisons to
determine the most efficient inference platform and to quantify how pre- and
post-processing overhead varies across different hardware implementations.

Abstract: We study the problem of best-arm identification in stochastic multi-armed
bandits under the fixed-confidence setting, with a particular focus on
instances that admit multiple optimal arms. While the Track-and-Stop algorithm
of Garivier and Kaufmann (2016) is widely conjectured to be instance-optimal,
its performance in the presence of multiple optima has remained insufficiently
understood. In this work, we revisit the Track-and-Stop strategy and propose a
modified stopping rule that ensures instance-optimality even when the set of
optimal arms is not a singleton. Our analysis introduces a new
information-theoretic lower bound that explicitly accounts for multiple optimal
arms, and we demonstrate that our stopping rule tightly matches this bound.

Abstract: Decision trees are a fundamental tool in machine learning for representing,
classifying, and generalizing data. It is desirable to construct ``small''
decision trees, by minimizing either the \textit{size} ($s$) or the
\textit{depth} $(d)$ of the \textit{decision tree} (\textsc{DT}). Recently, the
parameterized complexity of \textsc{Decision Tree Learning} has attracted a lot
of attention. We consider a generalization of \textsc{Decision Tree Learning}
where given a \textit{classification instance} $E$ and an integer $t$, the task
is to find a ``small'' \textsc{DT} that disagrees with $E$ in at most $t$
examples. We consider two problems: \textsc{DTSO} and \textsc{DTDO}, where the
goal is to construct a \textsc{DT} minimizing $s$ and $d$, respectively. We
first establish that both \textsc{DTSO} and \textsc{DTDO} are W[1]-hard when
parameterized by $s+\delta_{max}$ and $d+\delta_{max}$, respectively, where
$\delta_{max}$ is the maximum number of features in which two differently
labeled examples can differ. We complement this result by showing that these
problems become \textsc{FPT} if we include the parameter $t$. We also consider
the kernelization complexity of these problems and establish several positive
and negative results for both \textsc{DTSO} and \textsc{DTDO}.

Conclusion: 完成了高元PAC学习性的完整表征，为学习图、超图和关系结构提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Recently, the authors introduced the theory of high-arity PAC learning, which
is well-suited for learning graphs, hypergraphs and relational structures. In
the same initial work, the authors proved a high-arity analogue of the
Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning that almost completely
characterizes all notions of high-arity PAC learning in terms of a
combinatorial dimension, called the Vapnik--Chervonenkis--Natarajan (VCN${}_k$)
$k$-dimension, leaving as an open problem only the characterization of
non-partite, non-agnostic high-arity PAC learnability.
  In this work, we complete this characterization by proving that non-partite
non-agnostic high-arity PAC learnability implies a high-arity version of the
Haussler packing property, which in turn implies finiteness of
VCN${}_k$-dimension. This is done by obtaining direct proofs that classic PAC
learnability implies classic Haussler packing property, which in turn implies
finite Natarajan dimension and noticing that these direct proofs nicely lift to
high-arity.

Abstract: Deep learning-based models have demonstrated remarkable success in solving
illposed inverse problems; however, many fail to strictly adhere to the
physical constraints imposed by the measurement process. In this work, we
introduce a projection-based correction method to enhance the inference of deep
inverse networks by ensuring consistency with the forward model. Specifically,
given an initial estimate from a learned reconstruction network, we apply a
projection step that constrains the solution to lie within the valid solution
space of the inverse problem. We theoretically demonstrate that if the recovery
model is a well-trained deep inverse network, the solution can be decomposed
into range-space and null-space components, where the projection-based
correction reduces to an identity transformation. Extensive simulations and
experiments validate the proposed method, demonstrating improved reconstruction
accuracy across diverse inverse problems and deep network architectures.

Abstract: Asymmetric, non-Gaussian probability distributions are often observed in the
analysis of natural and engineering datasets. The lognormal distribution is a
standard model for data with skewed frequency histograms and fat tails.
However, the lognormal law severely restricts the asymptotic dependence of the
probability density and the hazard function for high values. Herein we present
a family of three-parameter non-Gaussian probability density functions that are
based on generalized kappa-exponential and kappa-logarithm functions and
investigate its mathematical properties. These kappa-lognormal densities
represent continuous deformations of the lognormal with lighter right tails,
controlled by the parameter kappa. In addition, bimodal distributions are
obtained for certain parameter combinations. We derive closed-form analytic
expressions for the main statistical functions of the kappa-lognormal
distribution. For the moments, we derive bounds that are based on
hypergeometric functions as well as series expansions. Explicit expressions for
the gradient and Hessian of the negative log-likelihood are obtained to
facilitate numerical maximum-likelihood estimates of the kappa-lognormal
parameters from data. We also formulate a joint probability density function
for kappa-lognormal stochastic processes by applying Jacobi's multivariate
theorem to a latent Gaussian process. Estimation of the kappa-lognormal
distribution based on synthetic and real data is explored. Furthermore, we
investigate applications of kappa-lognormal processes with different covariance
kernels in time series forecasting and spatial interpolation using warped
Gaussian process regression. Our results are of practical interest for modeling
skewed distributions in various scientific and engineering fields.

Abstract: Respiratory viral infections pose a global health burden, yet the cellular
immune responses driving protection or pathology remain unclear. Natural
infection cohorts often lack pre-exposure baseline data and structured temporal
sampling. In contrast, inoculation and vaccination trials generate insightful
longitudinal transcriptomic data. However, the scattering of these datasets
across platforms, along with inconsistent metadata and preprocessing procedure,
hinders AI-driven discovery. To address these challenges, we developed the
Human Respiratory Viral Immunization LongitudinAl Gene Expression
(HR-VILAGE-3K3M) repository: an AI-ready, rigorously curated dataset that
integrates 14,136 RNA-seq profiles from 3,178 subjects across 66 studies
encompassing over 2.56 million cells. Spanning vaccination, inoculation, and
mixed exposures, the dataset includes microarray, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell
RNA-seq from whole blood, PBMCs, and nasal swabs, sourced from GEO, ImmPort,
and ArrayExpress. We harmonized subject-level metadata, standardized outcome
measures, applied unified preprocessing pipelines with rigorous quality
control, and aligned all data to official gene symbols. To demonstrate the
utility of HR-VILAGE-3K3M, we performed predictive modeling of vaccine
responders and evaluated batch-effect correction methods. Beyond these initial
demonstrations, it supports diverse systems immunology applications and
benchmarking of feature selection and transfer learning algorithms. Its scale
and heterogeneity also make it ideal for pretraining foundation models of the
human immune response and for advancing multimodal learning frameworks. As the
largest longitudinal transcriptomic resource for human respiratory viral
immunization, it provides an accessible platform for reproducible AI-driven
research, accelerating systems immunology and vaccine development against
emerging viral threats.

Abstract: Daily environments have profound influence on our health and behavior. Recent
work has shown that digital envirotyping, where computer vision is applied to
images of daily environments taken during ecological momentary assessment
(EMA), can be used to identify meaningful relationships between environmental
features and health outcomes of interest. To systematically study such effects
on an individual level, it is helpful to group images into distinct
environments encountered in an individual's daily life; these may then be
analyzed, further grouped into related environments with similar features, and
linked to health outcomes. Here we introduce infinite hierarchical contrastive
clustering to address this challenge. Building on the established contrastive
clustering framework, our method a) allows an arbitrary number of clusters
without requiring the full Dirichlet Process machinery by placing a
stick-breaking prior on predicted cluster probabilities; and b) encourages
distinct environments to form well-defined sub-clusters within each cluster of
related environments by incorporating a participant-specific prediction loss.
Our experiments show that our model effectively identifies distinct personal
environments and groups these environments into meaningful environment types.
We then illustrate how the resulting clusters can be linked to various health
outcomes, highlighting the potential of our approach to advance the
envirotyping paradigm.

Abstract: Data fusion, the process of combining observational and experimental data,
can enable the identification of causal effects that would otherwise remain
non-identifiable. Although identification algorithms have been developed for
specific scenarios, do-calculus remains the only general-purpose tool for
causal data fusion, particularly when variables are present in some data
sources but not others. However, approaches based on do-calculus may encounter
computational challenges as the number of variables increases and the causal
graph grows in complexity. Consequently, there exists a need to reduce the size
of such models while preserving the essential features. For this purpose, we
propose pruning (removing unnecessary variables) and clustering (combining
variables) as preprocessing operations for causal data fusion. We generalize
earlier results on a single data source and derive conditions for applying
pruning and clustering in the case of multiple data sources. We give sufficient
conditions for inferring the identifiability or non-identifiability of a causal
effect in a larger graph based on a smaller graph and show how to obtain the
corresponding identifying functional for identifiable causal effects. Examples
from epidemiology and social science demonstrate the use of the results.

Abstract: A new machine learning scheme, termed versatile reservoir computing, is

large-scale complex network, though the elements are of different intrinsic
parameters and connectivities. Furthermore, by substituting failed elements
with the trained machine, we demonstrate that the collective dynamics of the
network can be preserved accurately over a finite time horizon. The capability
and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are validated on three representative
network models: a homogeneous complex network of non-identical phase
oscillators, a heterogeneous complex network of non-identical phase
oscillators, and a heterogeneous complex network of non-identical chaotic

Abstract: In electromyogram (EMG)-based motion recognition, a subject-specific
classifier is typically trained with sufficient labeled data. However, this
process demands extensive data collection over extended periods, burdening the
subject. To address this, utilizing information from pre-training on multiple
subjects for the training of the target subject could be beneficial. This paper
proposes an inter-subject variance transfer learning method based on a Bayesian
approach. This method is founded on the simple hypothesis that while the means
of EMG features vary greatly across subjects, their variances may exhibit
similar patterns. Our approach transfers variance information, acquired through
pre-training on multiple source subjects, to a target subject within a Bayesian
updating framework, thereby allowing accurate classification using limited
target calibration data. A coefficient was also introduced to adjust the amount
of information transferred for efficient transfer learning. Experimental
evaluations using two EMG datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our
variance transfer strategy and its superiority compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Optimal decision tree (\odt) is a fundamental problem arising in applications
such as active learning, entity identification, and medical diagnosis. An
instance of \odt is given by $m$ hypotheses, out of which an unknown ``true''
hypothesis is drawn according to some probability distribution. An algorithm
needs to identify the true hypothesis by making queries: each query incurs a
cost and has a known response for each hypothesis. The goal is to minimize the
expected query cost to identify the true hypothesis. We consider the most
general setting with arbitrary costs, probabilities and responses. \odt is
NP-hard to approximate better than $\ln m$ and there are $O(\ln m)$
approximation algorithms known for it. However, these algorithms and/or their
analyses are quite complex. Moreover, the leading constant factors are large.
We provide a simple algorithm and analysis for \odt, proving an approximation
ratio of $8 \ln m$.

Abstract: Accurately predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations is

Abstract: Germany's transition to a renewable energy-based power system is reshaping
grid operations, requiring advanced monitoring and control to manage
decentralized generation. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool
for power system protection, particularly for fault detection (FD) and fault
line identification (FLI) in transmission grids. However, ML model reliability
depends on data quality and availability. Data sparsity resulting from sensor
failures, communication disruptions, or reduced sampling rates poses a
challenge to ML-based FD and FLI. Yet, its impact has not been systematically
validated prior to this work. In response, we propose a framework to assess the
impact of data sparsity on ML-based FD and FLI performance. We simulate
realistic data sparsity scenarios, evaluate their impact, derive quantitative
insights, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this evaluation strategy by
applying it to an existing ML-based framework. Results show the ML model
remains robust for FD, maintaining an F1-score of 0.999 $\pm$ 0.000 even after
a 50x data reduction. In contrast, FLI is more sensitive, with performance
decreasing by 55.61% for missing voltage measurements and 9.73% due to
communication failures at critical network points. These findings offer
actionable insights for optimizing ML models for real-world grid protection.
This enables more efficient FD and supports targeted improvements in FLI.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the refractive environment over multiple frequencies
within the marine atmospheric boundary layer is crucial for the effective
deployment of radar technologies. Traditional parabolic equation simulations,
while effective, can be computationally expensive and time-intensive, limiting
their practical application. This communication explores a novel approach using
deep neural networks to estimate the pattern propagation factor, a critical
parameter for characterizing environmental impacts on signal propagation.
Image-to-image translation generators designed to ingest modified refractivity
data and generate predictions of pattern propagation factors over the same
domain were developed. Findings demonstrate that deep neural networks can be
trained to analyze multiple frequencies and reasonably predict the pattern
propagation factor, offering an alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the transition from nucleate to film boiling,
where heat transfer to the working fluid can rapidly deteriorate. Accurate CHF
prediction is essential for efficiency, safety, and preventing equipment
damage, particularly in nuclear reactors. Although widely used, empirical
correlations frequently exhibit discrepancies in comparison with experimental
data, limiting their reliability in diverse operational conditions. Traditional
machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated the potential for CHF
prediction but have often suffered from limited interpretability, data
scarcity, and insufficient knowledge of physical principles. Hybrid model
approaches, which combine data-driven ML with physics-based models, mitigate
these concerns by incorporating prior knowledge of the domain. This study
integrated a purely data-driven ML model and two hybrid models (using the Biasi
and Bowring CHF correlations) within the CTF subchannel code via a custom
Fortran framework. Performance was evaluated using two validation cases: a
subset of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission CHF database and the Bennett dryout
experiments. In both cases, the hybrid models exhibited significantly lower
error metrics in comparison with conventional empirical correlations. The pure
ML model remained competitive with the hybrid models. Trend analysis of error
parity indicates that ML-based models reduce the tendency for CHF
overprediction, improving overall accuracy. These results demonstrate that
ML-based CHF models can be effectively integrated into subchannel codes and can
potentially increase performance in comparison with conventional methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel surrogate modeling framework for aerodynamic
applications based on Neural Fields. The proposed approach, MARIO (Modulated
Aerodynamic Resolution Invariant Operator), addresses non parametric geometric
variability through an efficient shape encoding mechanism and exploits the
discretization-invariant nature of Neural Fields. It enables training on
significantly downsampled meshes, while maintaining consistent accuracy during
full-resolution inference. These properties allow for efficient modeling of
diverse flow conditions, while reducing computational cost and memory
requirements compared to traditional CFD solvers and existing surrogate
methods. The framework is validated on two complementary datasets that reflect
industrial constraints. First, the AirfRANS dataset consists in a
two-dimensional airfoil benchmark with non-parametric shape variations.
Performance evaluation of MARIO on this case demonstrates an order of magnitude
improvement in prediction accuracy over existing methods across velocity,
pressure, and turbulent viscosity fields, while accurately capturing boundary
layer phenomena and aerodynamic coefficients. Second, the NASA Common Research
Model features three-dimensional pressure distributions on a full aircraft
surface mesh, with parametric control surface deflections. This configuration
confirms MARIO's accuracy and scalability. Benchmarking against
state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that Neural Field surrogates can provide
rapid and accurate aerodynamic predictions under the computational and data
limitations characteristic of industrial applications.

Conclusion: 混合策略（非价格措施与价格工具结合）能带来额外10%的协同效益，为政策设计提供指导。

Abstract: Despite policymakers deploying various tools to mitigate emissions of ozone
(O\textsubscript{3}) precursors, such as nitrogen oxides (NO\textsubscript{x}),
carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the effectiveness
of policy combinations remains uncertain. We employ an integrated framework
that couples structural break detection with machine learning to pinpoint
effective interventions across the building, electricity, industrial, and
transport sectors, identifying treatment effects as abrupt changes without
prior assumptions about policy treatment assignment and timing. Applied to two
decades of global O\textsubscript{3} precursor emissions data, we detect 78,
77, and 78 structural breaks for NO\textsubscript{x}, CO, and VOCs,
corresponding to cumulative emission reductions of 0.96-0.97 Gt, 2.84-2.88 Gt,
and 0.47-0.48 Gt, respectively. Sector-level analysis shows that electricity
sector structural policies cut NO\textsubscript{x} by up to 32.4\%, while in
buildings, developed countries combined adoption subsidies with carbon taxes to
achieve 42.7\% CO reductions and developing countries used financing plus fuel
taxes to secure 52.3\%. VOCs abatement peaked at 38.5\% when fossil-fuel
subsidy reforms were paired with financial incentives. Finally, hybrid
strategies merging non-price measures (subsidies, bans, mandates) with pricing
instruments delivered up to an additional 10\% co-benefit. These findings guide
the sequencing and complementarity of context-specific policy portfolios for
O\textsubscript{3} precursor mitigation.

Abstract: The hippocampus orchestrates spatial navigation through collective place cell
encodings that form cognitive maps. We reconceptualize the population of place
cells as position embeddings approximating multi-scale symmetric random walk
transition kernels: the inner product $\langle h(x, t), h(y, t) \rangle =
q(y|x, t)$ represents normalized transition probabilities, where $h(x, t)$ is
the embedding at location $ x $, and $q(y|x, t)$ is the normalized symmetric
transition probability over time $t$. The time parameter $\sqrt{t}$ defines a
spatial scale hierarchy, mirroring the hippocampal dorsoventral axis. $q(y|x,
t)$ defines spatial adjacency between $x$ and $y$ at scale or resolution
$\sqrt{t}$, and the pairwise adjacency relationships $(q(y|x, t), \forall x,
y)$ are reduced into individual embeddings $(h(x, t), \forall x)$ that
collectively form a map of the environment at sale $\sqrt{t}$. Our framework
employs gradient ascent on $q(y|x, t) = \langle h(x, t), h(y, t)\rangle$ with
adaptive scale selection, choosing the time scale with maximal gradient at each
step for trap-free, smooth trajectories. Efficient matrix squaring $P_{2t} =
P_t^2$ builds global representations from local transitions $P_1$ without
memorizing past trajectories, enabling hippocampal preplay-like path planning.
This produces robust navigation through complex environments, aligning with
hippocampal navigation. Experimental results show that our model captures place
cell properties -- field size distribution, adaptability, and remapping --
while achieving computational efficiency. By modeling collective transition
probabilities rather than individual place fields, we offer a biologically
plausible, scalable framework for spatial navigation.

Abstract: Automated epileptic seizure detection from electroencephalogram (EEG) remains
challenging due to significant individual differences in EEG patterns across
patients. While existing studies achieve high accuracy with patient-specific
approaches, they face difficulties in generalizing to new patients. To address
this, we propose a detection framework combining domain adversarial training
with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term
memory (BiLSTM). First, the CNN extracts local patient-invariant features
through domain adversarial training, which optimizes seizure detection accuracy
while minimizing patient-specific characteristics. Then, the BiLSTM captures
temporal dependencies in the extracted features to model seizure evolution
patterns. Evaluation using EEG recordings from 20 patients with focal epilepsy
demonstrated superior performance over non-adversarial methods, achieving high
detection accuracy across different patients. The integration of adversarial
training with temporal modeling enables robust cross-patient seizure detection.

Abstract: Electromyogram (EMG) signals recorded from the skin surface enable intuitive
control of assistive devices such as prosthetic limbs. However, in EMG-based
motion recognition, collecting comprehensive training data for all target
motions remains challenging, particularly for complex combined motions. This
paper proposes a method to efficiently recognize combined motions using
synthetic EMG data generated through convex combinations of basic motion
patterns. Instead of measuring all possible combined motions, the proposed
method utilizes measured basic motion data along with synthetically combined
motion data for training. This approach expands the range of recognizable
combined motions while minimizing the required training data collection. We
evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method through an upper limb motion
classification experiment with eight subjects. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method improved the classification accuracy for
unseen combined motions by approximately 17%.

Conclusion: 模块化方法简化了JGP，同时保留了其核心优势，适用于跳跃过程的建模。

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) furnish accurate nonlinear predictions with
well-calibrated uncertainty. However, the typical GP setup has a built-in
stationarity assumption, making it ill-suited for modeling data from processes
with sudden changes, or "jumps" in the output variable. The "jump GP" (JGP) was
developed for modeling data from such processes, combining local GPs and latent
"level" variables under a joint inferential framework. But joint modeling can
be fraught with difficulty. We aim to simplify by suggesting a more modular
setup, eschewing joint inference but retaining the main JGP themes: (a)
learning optimal neighborhood sizes that locally respect manifolds of
discontinuity; and (b) a new cluster-based (latent) feature to capture regions
of distinct output levels on both sides of the manifold. We show that each of
(a) and (b) separately leads to dramatic improvements when modeling processes
with jumps. In tandem (but without requiring joint inference) that benefit is
compounded, as illustrated on real and synthetic benchmark examples from the
recent literature.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel parametrization approach for aeroelastic systems
utilizing Koopman theory, specifically leveraging the Koopman Bilinear Form

KBF model, we introduce the Extended KBF (EKBF) model, which enables a global
linear representation of aeroelastic dynamics while capturing stronger
nonlinear dependence on, e.g., the flutter parameter. The effectiveness of the
proposed methodology is demonstrated through two case studies: a 2D academic
example and a panel flutter problem. Results show that EKBF effectively
interpolates and extrapolates principal eigenvalues, capturing flutter
mechanisms, and accurately predicting the flutter boundary even when the data
is corrupted by noise. Furthermore, parameterized isostable and isochron
identified by EKBF provides valuable insights into the nonlinear flutter
system.

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of in-vehicle network
protocols such as controller area networks (CAN) and proposed machine
learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) as an effective mitigation
technique. However, their efficient integration into vehicular architecture is
non-trivial, with existing methods relying on electronic control units
(ECUs)-coupled IDS accelerators or dedicated ECUs as IDS accelerators. Here,
initiating IDS requires complete reception of a CAN message from the
controller, incurring data movement and software overheads. In this paper, we
present SecCAN, a novel CAN controller architecture that embeds IDS capability
within the datapath of the controller. This integration allows IDS to tap
messages directly from within the CAN controller as they are received from the
bus, removing overheads incurred by existing ML-based IDSs. A custom-quantised
machine-learning accelerator is developed as the IDS engine and embedded into
SecCAN's receive data path, with optimisations to overlap the IDS inference
with the protocol's reception window. We implement SecCAN on AMD XCZU7EV FPGA
to quantify its performance and benefits in hardware, using multiple attack
datasets. We show that SecCAN can completely hide the IDS latency within the
CAN reception window for all CAN packet sizes and detect multiple attacks with
state-of-the-art accuracy with zero software overheads on the ECU and low
energy overhead (73.7 uJ per message) for IDS inference. Also, SecCAN incurs
limited resource overhead compared to a standard CAN controller (< 30% LUT, <
1% FF), making it ideally suited for automotive deployment.

Abstract: Dynamic FDG PET imaging study of n = 52 rats including 26 control
Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and 26 experimental spontaneously hypertensive rats
(SHR) were performed using a Siemens microPET and Albira trimodal scanner
longitudinally at 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12 and 18 months of age. A 15-parameter dual
output model correcting for spill over contamination and partial volume effects
with peak fitting cost functions was developed for simultaneous estimation of
model corrected blood input function (MCIF) and kinetic rate constants for
dynamic FDG PET images of rat heart in vivo. Major drawbacks of this model are
its dependence on manual annotations for the Image Derived Input Function
(IDIF) and manual determination of crucial model parameters to compute MCIF. To
overcome these limitations, we performed semi-automated segmentation and then
formulated a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell network to train and predict
MCIF in test data using a concatenation of IDIFs and myocardial inputs and
compared them with reference-modeled MCIF. Thresholding along 2D plane slices
with two thresholds, with T1 representing high-intensity myocardium, and T2
representing lower-intensity rings, was used to segment the area of the LV
blood pool. The resultant IDIF and myocardial TACs were used to compute the
corresponding reference (model) MCIF for all data sets. The segmented IDIF and
the myocardium formed the input for the LSTM network. A k-fold cross validation
structure with a 33:8:11 split and 5 folds was utilized to create the model and
evaluate the performance of the LSTM network for all datasets. To overcome the
sparseness of data as time steps increase, midpoint interpolation was utilized
to increase the density of datapoints beyond time = 10 minutes. The model
utilizing midpoint interpolation was able to achieve a 56.4% improvement over
previous Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Primal-Dual Natural Actor-Critic algorithm that adeptly manages constraints
while ensuring a high convergence rate. In particular, our algorithm achieves
global convergence and constraint violation rates of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ over a horizon of length $T$ when the mixing
time, $\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}$, is known to the learner. In absence of knowledge
of $\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}$, the achievable rates change to
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/T^{0.5-\epsilon})$ provided that $T \geq
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}^{2/\epsilon}\right)$. Our results
match the theoretical lower bound for Markov Decision Processes and establish a
new benchmark in the theoretical exploration of average reward CMDPs.
