Motivation: 研究基础模型选择对奖励建模性能的影响，以优化RLHF中的奖励模型训练。

Method: 通过系统分析不同基础模型对奖励建模性能的影响，结合小规模基准数据提升模型选择效果。

Result: 性能提升14%，结合基准数据可平均提升18%的模型选择效果。

Conclusion: 基础模型选择对奖励建模性能至关重要，结合基准数据可显著提升效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and, at its core, reward
modeling have become a crucial part of training powerful large language models
(LLMs). One commonly overlooked factor in training high-quality reward models
(RMs) is the effect of the base model, which is becoming more challenging to
choose given the rapidly growing pool of LLMs. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of the effect of base model selection on reward modeling
performance. Our results show that the performance can be improved by up to 14%
compared to the most common (i.e., default) choice. Moreover, we showcase the
strong statistical relation between some existing benchmarks and downstream
performances. We also demonstrate that the results from a small set of
benchmarks could be combined to boost the model selection ($+$18% on average in
the top 5-10). Lastly, we illustrate the impact of different post-training
steps on the final performance and explore using estimated data distributions
to reduce performance prediction error.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在零样本泛化中通用知识与任务特定知识纠缠的问题。

Method: 构建任务特定LoRA模块库和通用LoRA模块，通过减法分离任务相关模块，动态组合模块。

Result: 在Phi-3和Phi-2模型上，跨语言和多任务基准测试中表现一致提升。

Conclusion: GenKnowSub方法有效提升零样本泛化能力，适用于不同规模模型。

Abstract: Large language models often struggle with zero-shot generalization, and
several modular approaches have been proposed to address this challenge. Yet,
we hypothesize that a key limitation remains: the entanglement of general
knowledge and task-specific adaptations. To overcome this, we propose a modular
framework that disentangles these components by constructing a library of
task-specific LoRA modules alongside a general-domain LoRA. By subtracting this
general knowledge component from each task-specific module, we obtain residual
modules that focus more exclusively on task-relevant information, a method we
call general knowledge subtraction (GenKnowSub). Leveraging the refined
task-specific modules and the Arrow routing algorithm
\citep{ostapenko2024towards}, we dynamically select and combine modules for new
inputs without additional training. Our studies on the Phi-3 model and standard
Arrow as baselines reveal that using general knowledge LoRAs derived from
diverse languages, including English, French, and German, yields consistent
performance gains in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings across a wide
set of benchmarks. Further experiments on Phi-2 demonstrate how GenKnowSub
generalizes to weaker LLMs. The complete code and data are available at

Conclusion: 研究推进了对ICL的理解，为模型开发者提供了改进方向，并为AI安全实践者提供了更明确的指导依据。

Abstract: Large-scale Transformer language models (LMs) trained solely on next-token
prediction with web-scale data can solve a wide range of tasks after seeing
just a few examples. The mechanism behind this capability, known as in-context
learning (ICL), remains both controversial and poorly understood. Some studies
argue that it is merely the result of memorizing vast amounts of data, while
others contend that it reflects a fundamental, symbolic algorithmic development
in LMs. In this work, we introduce a suite of investigative tasks and a novel
method to systematically investigate ICL by leveraging the full Pythia scaling
suite, including interim checkpoints that capture progressively larger amount
of training data. By carefully exploring ICL performance on downstream tasks
and simultaneously conducting a mechanistic analysis of the residual stream's
subspace, we demonstrate that ICL extends beyond mere "memorization" of the
training corpus, yet does not amount to the implementation of an independent
symbolic algorithm. Our results also clarify several aspects of ICL, including
the influence of training dynamics, model capabilities, and elements of
mechanistic interpretability. Overall, our work advances the understanding of
ICL and its implications, offering model developers insights into potential
improvements and providing AI security practitioners with a basis for more
informed guidelines.

Result: 方法成功注入3种算法，创建了可解释的子空间，并提高了分布外性能。

Conclusion: tracr-injection方法为Transformer的符号能力提供了实践验证，并展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Motivated by the surge of large language models, there has been a push to
formally characterize the symbolic abilities intrinsic to the transformer
architecture. A programming language, called RASP, has been proposed, which can
be directly compiled into transformer weights to implement these algorithms.
However, the tasks that can be implemented in RASP are often uncommon to learn
from natural unsupervised data, showing a mismatch between theoretical
capabilities of the transformer architecture, and the practical learnability of
these capabilities from unsupervised data. We propose tracr-injection, a method
that allows us to distill algorithms written in RASP directly into a
pre-trained language model. We showcase our method by injecting 3 different
algorithms into a language model. We show how our method creates an
interpretable subspace within the model's residual stream, which can be decoded
into the variables present in the code of the RASP algorithm. Additionally, we
found that the proposed method can improve out of distribution performance
compared to our baseline, indicating that indeed a more symbolic mechanism is
taking place in the inner workings of the model. We release the code used to
run our experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提示工程效率低下，现有自动化方法因随机评估子集不可靠，且核心集选择方法不适用于提示优化。

Method: IPOMP采用两阶段方法：语义聚类和边界分析选择样本，再通过实时性能数据迭代替换冗余样本。

Result: 在BIG-bench数据集上，IPOMP效果提升1.6%至5.3%，稳定性提升至少57%，计算开销低于1%。

Conclusion: IPOMP是一种通用方法，可增强现有核心集选择方法，适用于提示优化。

Abstract: Optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) performance requires well-crafted
prompts, but manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and often
ineffective. Automated prompt optimization techniques address this challenge
but the majority of them rely on randomly selected evaluation subsets, which
fail to represent the full dataset, leading to unreliable evaluations and
suboptimal prompts. Existing coreset selection methods, designed for LLM
benchmarking, are unsuitable for prompt optimization due to challenges in
clustering similar samples, high data collection costs, and the unavailability
of performance data for new or private datasets. To overcome these issues, we
propose IPOMP, an Iterative evaluation data selection for effective Prompt
Optimization using real-time Model Performance. IPOMP is a two-stage approach
that selects representative and diverse samples using semantic clustering and
boundary analysis, followed by iterative refinement with real-time model
performance data to replace redundant samples. Evaluations on the BIG-bench
dataset show that IPOMP improves effectiveness by 1.6% to 5.3% and stability by
at least 57% compared with SOTA baselines, with minimal computational overhead
below 1%. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that our real-time
performance-guided refinement approach can be universally applied to enhance
existing coreset selection methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于基线，验证了排名答案信息和排名投票对提升推理性能的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过利用排名答案信息和排名投票，可以显著提高链式思维推理的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Majority voting is considered an effective method to enhance chain-of-thought
reasoning, as it selects the answer with the highest "self-consistency" among
different reasoning paths (Wang et al., 2023). However, previous
chain-of-thought reasoning methods typically generate only a single answer in
each trial, thereby ignoring the possibility of other potential answers. As a
result, these alternative answers are often overlooked in subsequent voting
processes. In this work, we propose to generate ranked answers in each
reasoning process and conduct ranked voting among multiple ranked answers from
different responses, thereby making the overall self-consistency more reliable.
Specifically, we use three ranked voting methods: Instant-runoff voting, Borda
count voting, and mean reciprocal rank voting. We validate our methods on six
datasets, including three multiple-choice and three open-ended
question-answering tasks, using both advanced open-source and closed-source
large language models. Extensive experimental results indicate that our
proposed method outperforms the baselines, showcasing the potential of
leveraging the information of ranked answers and using ranked voting to improve
reasoning performance. The code is available at

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
improve factuality in large language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs
in retrieved documents. However, ensuring perfect retrieval of relevant
information remains challenging, and when irrelevant content is passed
downstream to an LLM, it can lead to hallucinations. In this work, we propose
Finetune-RAG, a simple and effective fine-tuning approach that features the
first-of-its-kind RAG training dataset constructed to mimic real-world
imperfections. Experimental results show that Finetune-RAG improves factual
accuracy by 21.2% over the base model. We also propose a Bench-RAG, an
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation pipeline that stress tests models under realistic
imperfect retrieval scenarios. Our codebase and dataset are fully open sourced
for community use.

Conclusion: AutoThink为大型推理模型提供了一种可扩展且自适应的推理范式。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) are proficient at generating explicit,
step-by-step reasoning sequences before producing final answers. However, such
detailed reasoning can introduce substantial computational overhead and
latency, particularly for simple problems. To address this over-thinking
problem, we explore how to equip LRMs with adaptive thinking capabilities:
enabling them to dynamically decide whether or not to engage in explicit
reasoning based on problem complexity. Building on R1-style distilled models,
we observe that inserting a simple ellipsis ("...") into the prompt can
stochastically trigger either a thinking or no-thinking mode, revealing a
latent controllability in the reasoning behavior. Leveraging this property, we
propose AutoThink, a multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) framework that
progressively optimizes reasoning policies via stage-wise reward shaping.
AutoThink learns to invoke explicit reasoning only when necessary, while
defaulting to succinct responses for simpler tasks. Experiments on five
mainstream mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoThink achieves
favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to recent prompting and
RL-based pruning methods. It can be seamlessly integrated into any R1-style
model, including both distilled and further fine-tuned variants. Notably,
AutoThink improves relative accuracy by 6.4 percent while reducing token usage
by 52 percent on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, establishing a scalable and
adaptive reasoning paradigm for LRMs.

Abstract: Recently, AI-driven interactions with computing devices have advanced from
basic prototype tools to sophisticated, LLM-based systems that emulate
human-like operations in graphical user interfaces. We are now witnessing the
emergence of \emph{Computer-Using Agents} (CUAs), capable of autonomously
performing tasks such as navigating desktop applications, web pages, and mobile
apps. However, as these agents grow in capability, they also introduce novel
safety and security risks. Vulnerabilities in LLM-driven reasoning, with the
added complexity of integrating multiple software components and multimodal
inputs, further complicate the security landscape. In this paper, we present a
systematization of knowledge on the safety and security threats of CUAs. We
conduct a comprehensive literature review and distill our findings along four
research objectives: \textit{\textbf{(i)}} define the CUA that suits safety
analysis; \textit{\textbf{(ii)} } categorize current safety threats among CUAs;
\textit{\textbf{(iii)}} propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing defensive
strategies; \textit{\textbf{(iv)}} summarize prevailing benchmarks, datasets,
and evaluation metrics used to assess the safety and performance of CUAs.
Building on these insights, our work provides future researchers with a
structured foundation for exploring unexplored vulnerabilities and offers
practitioners actionable guidance in designing and deploying secure
Computer-Using Agents.

Conclusion: Cochain为业务工作流中的LLM协作提供了一种高效且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
executing complex reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thought effectively enhances
reasoning capabilities by unlocking the potential of large models, while
multi-agent systems provide more comprehensive solutions by integrating
collective intelligence of multiple agents. However, both approaches face
significant limitations. Single-agent with chain-of-thought, due to the
inherent complexity of designing cross-domain prompts, faces collaboration
challenges. Meanwhile, multi-agent systems consume substantial tokens and
inevitably dilute the primary problem, which is particularly problematic in
business workflow tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Cochain, a
collaboration prompting framework that effectively solves business workflow
collaboration problem by combining knowledge and prompts at a reduced cost.
Specifically, we construct an integrated knowledge graph that incorporates
knowledge from multiple stages. Furthermore, by maintaining and retrieving a
prompts tree, we can obtain prompt information relevant to other stages of the
business workflow. We perform extensive evaluations of Cochain across multiple
datasets, demonstrating that Cochain outperforms all baselines in both prompt
engineering and multi-agent LLMs. Additionally, expert evaluation results
indicate that the use of a small model in combination with Cochain outperforms
GPT-4.

Abstract: The emergence of large reasoning models (LRMs) has transformed Natural
Language Processing by excelling in complex tasks such as mathematical
problem-solving and code generation. These models leverage chain-of-thought
(CoT) processes, enabling them to emulate human-like reasoning strategies.
However, the advancement of LRMs is hindered by the lack of comprehensive CoT
datasets. Current resources often fail to provide extensive reasoning problems
with coherent CoT processes distilled from multiple teacher models and do not
account for multifaceted properties describing the internal characteristics of
CoTs. To address these challenges, we introduce OmniThought, a large-scale
dataset featuring 2 million CoT processes generated and validated by two
powerful LRMs as teacher models. Each CoT process in OmniThought is annotated
with novel Reasoning Verbosity (RV) and Cognitive Difficulty (CD) scores, which
describe the appropriateness of CoT verbosity and cognitive difficulty level
for models to comprehend these reasoning processes. We further establish a
self-reliant pipeline to curate this dataset. Extensive experiments using
Qwen2.5 models of various sizes demonstrate the positive impact of our proposed
scores on LRM training effectiveness. Based on the proposed OmniThought
dataset, we further train and release a series of high-performing LRMs,
specifically equipped with stronger reasoning abilities and optimal CoT output
length and difficulty level. Our contributions significantly enhance the
development and training of LRMs for solving complex tasks.

<details>

Motivation: LLMs在部署时需要大量计算资源，KV Cache虽能减少推理时的重计算，但增加了内存开销。量化KV Cache是平衡内存和准确性的有效方法，但现有方法对异常token的处理不足。

Method: 研究发现Keys和Values的分布模式不同，但异常token会破坏这种模式。作者提出了一种简单有效的方法，在解码过程中识别并排除这些异常token，避免其对量化准确性的影响。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在2-bit量化下显著提高了准确性，内存使用减少了6.4倍，吞吐量提高了2.3倍。

Conclusion: 通过识别和处理异常token，可以显著优化KV Cache量化的效果，为LLMs的高效部署提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) come at the cost
of substantial computational resources during deployment. While KV Cache can
significantly reduce recomputation during inference, it also introduces
additional memory overhead. KV Cache quantization presents a promising
solution, striking a good balance between memory usage and accuracy. Previous
research has shown that the Keys are distributed by channel, while the Values
are distributed by token. Consequently, the common practice is to apply
channel-wise quantization to the Keys and token-wise quantization to the
Values. However, our further investigation reveals that a small subset of
unusual tokens exhibit unique characteristics that deviate from this pattern,
which can substantially impact quantization accuracy. To address this, we
develop a simple yet effective method to identify these tokens accurately
during the decoding process and exclude them from quantization as outlier
tokens, significantly improving overall accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method achieves significant accuracy improvements under 2-bit
quantization and can deliver a 6.4 times reduction in memory usage and a 2.3
times increase in throughput.

Result: SALT在跨语言理解和语言适应中表现优异，损失更低且收敛更快。

Conclusion: SALT为增强当代大型语言模型的功能提供了一种可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly incorporate multilingual
capabilities, fueling the demand to transfer them into target language-specific
models. However, most approaches, which blend the source model's embedding by
replacing the source vocabulary with the target language-specific vocabulary,
may constrain expressive capacity in the target language since the source model
is predominantly trained on English data. In this paper, we propose Semantic
Aware Linear Transfer (SALT), a novel cross-lingual transfer technique that
recycles embeddings from target language Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to
transmit the deep representational strengths of PLM-derived embedding to LLMs.
SALT derives unique regression lines based on the similarity in the overlap of
the source and target vocabularies, to handle each non-overlapping token's
embedding space. Our extensive experiments show that SALT significantly
outperforms other transfer methods and achieves lower loss with accelerating
faster convergence during language adaptation. Notably, SALT obtains remarkable
performance in cross-lingual understanding setups compared to other methods.
Furthermore, we highlight the scalable use of PLMs to enhance the functionality
of contemporary LLMs by conducting experiments with varying architectures.

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI is
hindered by their reliance on single-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data,
which limits contextual coherence in multi-turn dialogues. Existing methods for
generating multi-turn dialogue data struggle to ensure both diversity and
quality in instructions. To address this, we propose Review-Instruct, a novel
framework that synthesizes multi-turn conversations through an iterative
"Ask-Respond-Review" process involving three agent roles: a Candidate, multiple
Reviewers, and a Chairman. The framework iteratively refines instructions by
incorporating Reviewer feedback, enhancing dialogue diversity and difficulty.
We construct a multi-turn dataset using the Alpaca dataset and fine-tune the
LLaMA2-13B model. Evaluations on MT-Bench, MMLU-Pro, and Auto-Arena demonstrate
significant improvements, achieving absolute gains of 2.9\% on MMLU-Pro and 2\%

Motivation: 探索LLMs在处理结构化符号知识（如本体）方面的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出LLMs本体能力的分类法，并基于此设计OntoURL基准，包含15个任务、58,981个问题，覆盖8个领域的40个本体。

Result: 实验显示LLMs在本体理解上表现良好，但在推理和学习任务上存在显著不足。

Conclusion: OntoURL为LLMs与形式知识表示的整合提供了关键基准，揭示了LLMs处理符号知识的根本限制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a range of natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to process
structured symbolic knowledge remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
propose a taxonomy of LLMs' ontological capabilities and introduce OntoURL, the
first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs'
proficiency in handling ontologies -- formal, symbolic representations of
domain knowledge through concepts, relationships, and instances. Based on the
proposed taxonomy, OntoURL systematically assesses three dimensions:
understanding, reasoning, and learning through 15 distinct tasks comprising
58,981 questions derived from 40 ontologies across 8 domains. Experiments with
20 open-source LLMs reveal significant performance differences across models,
tasks, and domains, with current LLMs showing proficiency in understanding
ontological knowledge but substantial weaknesses in reasoning and learning
tasks. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in LLMs' capability to
process symbolic knowledge and establish OntoURL as a critical benchmark for
advancing the integration of LLMs with formal knowledge representations.

Result: BLEUBERI在多个基准测试中表现与奖励模型对齐的模型相当，且生成内容更事实准确。

Conclusion: 基于字符串匹配的指标是奖励模型的有效廉价替代方案。

Abstract: Reward models are central to aligning LLMs with human preferences, but they
are costly to train, requiring large-scale human-labeled preference data and
powerful pretrained LLM backbones. Meanwhile, the increasing availability of
high-quality synthetic instruction-following datasets raises the question: can
simpler, reference-based metrics serve as viable alternatives to reward models
during RL-based alignment? In this paper, we show first that BLEU, a basic
string-matching metric, surprisingly matches strong reward models in agreement
with human preferences on general instruction-following datasets. Based on this
insight, we develop BLEUBERI, a method that first identifies challenging
instructions and then applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using
BLEU directly as the reward function. We demonstrate that BLEUBERI-trained
models are competitive with models trained via reward model-guided RL across
four challenging instruction-following benchmarks and three different base
language models. A human evaluation further supports that the quality of
BLEUBERI model outputs is on par with those from reward model-aligned models.
Moreover, BLEUBERI models generate outputs that are more factually grounded
than competing methods. Overall, we show that given access to high-quality
reference outputs (easily obtained via existing instruction-following datasets
or synthetic data generation), string matching-based metrics are cheap yet
effective proxies for reward models during alignment. We release our code and
data at https://github.com/lilakk/BLEUBERI.

Abstract: Recent studies on large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities have
demonstrated promising improvements in model performance by leveraging a
lengthy thinking process and additional computational resources during
inference, primarily in tasks involving mathematical reasoning (Muennighoff et
al., 2025). However, it remains uncertain if longer reasoning chains inherently
enhance factual accuracy, particularly beyond mathematical contexts. In this
work, we thoroughly examine LLM reasoning within complex open-domain
question-answering (QA) scenarios. We initially distill reasoning traces from
advanced, large-scale reasoning models (QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1-671B), then
fine-tune a variety of models ranging from smaller, instruction-tuned variants
to larger architectures based on Qwen2.5. To enrich reasoning traces, we
introduce factual information from knowledge graphs in the form of paths into
our reasoning traces. Our experimental setup includes four baseline approaches
and six different instruction-tuned models evaluated across a benchmark of six
datasets, encompassing over 22.6K questions. Overall, we carry out 168
experimental runs and analyze approximately 1.7 million reasoning traces. Our
findings indicate that, within a single run, smaller reasoning models achieve
noticeable improvements in factual accuracy compared to their original
instruction-tuned counterparts. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that adding
test-time compute and token budgets factual accuracy consistently improves by
2-8%, further confirming the effectiveness of test-time scaling for enhancing
performance and consequently improving reasoning accuracy in open-domain QA
tasks. We release all the experimental artifacts for further research.

Result: SoLoPO显著提升了长度和领域泛化能力，同时提高了计算和内存效率。

Conclusion: SoLoPO框架有效解决了长上下文对齐问题，兼容主流偏好优化算法。

Abstract: Despite advances in pretraining with extended context lengths, large language
models (LLMs) still face challenges in effectively utilizing real-world
long-context information, primarily due to insufficient long-context alignment
caused by data quality issues, training inefficiencies, and the lack of
well-designed optimization objectives. To address these limitations, we propose
a framework named $\textbf{S}$h$\textbf{o}$rt-to-$\textbf{Lo}$ng
$\textbf{P}$reference $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{SoLoPO}$), decoupling
long-context preference optimization (PO) into two components: short-context PO
and short-to-long reward alignment (SoLo-RA), supported by both theoretical and
empirical evidence. Specifically, short-context PO leverages preference pairs
sampled from short contexts to enhance the model's contextual knowledge
utilization ability. Meanwhile, SoLo-RA explicitly encourages reward score
consistency utilization for the responses when conditioned on both short and
long contexts that contain identical task-relevant information. This
facilitates transferring the model's ability to handle short contexts into
long-context scenarios. SoLoPO is compatible with mainstream preference
optimization algorithms, while substantially improving the efficiency of data
construction and training processes. Experimental results show that SoLoPO
enhances all these algorithms with respect to stronger length and domain
generalization abilities across various long-context benchmarks, while
achieving notable improvements in both computational and memory efficiency.

Motivation: 研究无位置编码的Transformer在平均硬注意力机制下的表达能力，填补了现有理论对这类模型理解的空白。

Method: 通过理论分析，刻画了NoPE-AHATs（无位置编码的平均硬注意力Transformer）能够表达的语言类别，即半代数集。

Result: NoPE-AHATs能够表达复杂的计数语言（如Diophantine方程的解），但其分析问题是不可判定的。同时，发现某些计数语言即使有位置编码也无法表达。

Conclusion: 无位置编码的Transformer在特定注意力机制下具有强大的表达能力，但其复杂性和不可判定性限制了实际应用。

Abstract: Positional Encodings (PEs) seem to be indispensable for ensuring
expressiveness of transformers; without them attention transformers reduce to a
bag-of-word model. NoPE-transformers (i.e. with No PEs) with unique hard
attention mechanisms were very recently shown to only be able to express
regular languages, i.e., with limited counting ability. This paper shows that,
with average hard attention mechanisms, NoPE-transformers are still
surprisingly expressive: they can express counting languages corresponding to
nonnegative integer solutions to multivariate polynomial equations (i.e.
Diophantine equations), reasoning about which is well-known to be undecidable.
In fact, we provide a precise characterization of languages expressible by
Average Hard Attention NoPE-Transformers (NoPE-AHATs): they correspond
precisely to what we call \emph{semi-algebraic sets}, i.e., finite unions of
sets of nonnegative integer solutions to systems of multivariate polynomial
inequations. We obtain several interesting consequences of our
characterization. Firstly, NoPE-transformers can express counting properties
that are far more complex than established models like simplified counter
machines and Petri nets, but cannot express a very simple counting property of
PARITY. Secondly, the problem of analyzing NoPE-transformers is undecidable,
e.g., whether a given NoPE transformer classifies all input strings in one
class. To complement our results, we exhibit a counting language that is not
expressible by average hard attention transformers even with arbitrary PEs but
is expressible in the circuit complexity class TC$^0$, answering an open
problem.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在测试时扩展长度时无法利用历史信息的问题，以逐步生成更简洁的解决方案。

Method: 提出HAPO，记录历史状态（如最小正确响应长度），并设计长度奖励函数，结合正确性奖励联合优化。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，HAPO将输出长度减少33-59%，准确性仅下降2-5%。

Conclusion: HAPO有效提升了LLM的简洁推理能力，平衡了效率和正确性。

Abstract: While scaling the length of responses at test-time has been shown to markedly
improve the reasoning abilities and performance of large language models
(LLMs), it often results in verbose outputs and increases inference cost. Prior
approaches for efficient test-time scaling, typically using universal budget
constraints or query-level length optimization, do not leverage historical
information from previous encounters with the same problem during training. We
hypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more
concise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy
Optimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum
length over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO
employs a novel length reward function based on this history state to
incentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those
previously found. Crucially, this reward structure avoids overly penalizing
shorter incorrect responses with the goal of facilitating exploration towards
more efficient solutions. By combining this length reward with a correctness
reward, HAPO jointly optimizes for correctness and efficiency. We use HAPO to
train DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, and
Qwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and evaluate HAPO on several math benchmarks that span
various difficulty levels. Experiment results demonstrate that HAPO effectively
induces LLMs' concise reasoning abilities, producing length reductions of
33-59% with accuracy drops of only 2-5%.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but
are inherently limited by their knowledge reservoir. Retrieval-augmented
reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external
resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information,
hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a
reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new
``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit
knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model
to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an
answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards
alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization.
Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that
AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in
complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine
issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.

Abstract: Despite the growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in academic

general-purpose scientific text generation and fail to meet the sophisticated
demands of research communication beyond surface-level polishing, such as
conceptual coherence across sections. Furthermore, academic writing is
inherently iterative and revision-driven, a process not well supported by
direct prompting-based paradigms. To address these scenarios, we propose a
human-AI collaboration framework for academic paper revision. We first
introduce a comprehensive dataset of 7,040 research papers from top-tier venues
annotated with over 140,000 instruction-response pairs that reflect realistic,
section-level scientific revisions. Building on the dataset, we develop
XtraGPT, the first suite of open-source LLMs, designed to provide
context-aware, instruction-guided writing assistance, ranging from 1.5B to 14B

outperforms same-scale baselines and approaches the quality of proprietary

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed as autonomous agents
capable of following user instructions and making decisions in real-world
applications. Previous studies have made notable progress in benchmarking the
instruction following capabilities of LLMs in general domains, with a primary
focus on their inherent commonsense knowledge. Recently, LLMs have been
increasingly deployed as domain-oriented agents, which rely on domain-oriented
guidelines that may conflict with their commonsense knowledge. These guidelines
exhibit two key characteristics: they consist of a wide range of
domain-oriented rules and are subject to frequent updates. Despite these
challenges, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the
domain-oriented guideline following capabilities of LLMs presents a significant
obstacle to their effective assessment and further development. In this paper,
we introduce GuideBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
guideline following performance of LLMs. GuideBench evaluates LLMs on three
critical aspects: (i) adherence to diverse rules, (ii) robustness to rule
updates, and (iii) alignment with human preferences. Experimental results on a
range of LLMs indicate substantial opportunities for improving their ability to
follow domain-oriented guidelines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical contexts,
raising critical concerns about safety, alignment, and susceptibility to
adversarial manipulation. While prior benchmarks assess model refusal
capabilities for harmful prompts, they often lack clinical specificity, graded
harmfulness levels, and coverage of jailbreak-style attacks. We introduce CARES
(Clinical Adversarial Robustness and Evaluation of Safety), a benchmark for
evaluating LLM safety in healthcare. CARES includes over 18,000 prompts
spanning eight medical safety principles, four harm levels, and four prompting
styles: direct, indirect, obfuscated, and role-play, to simulate both malicious
and benign use cases. We propose a three-way response evaluation protocol
(Accept, Caution, Refuse) and a fine-grained Safety Score metric to assess
model behavior. Our analysis reveals that many state-of-the-art LLMs remain
vulnerable to jailbreaks that subtly rephrase harmful prompts, while also
over-refusing safe but atypically phrased queries. Finally, we propose a
mitigation strategy using a lightweight classifier to detect jailbreak attempts
and steer models toward safer behavior via reminder-based conditioning. CARES
provides a rigorous framework for testing and improving medical LLM safety
under adversarial and ambiguous conditions.

Abstract: Reasoning-enhanced large language models (RLLMs), whether explicitly trained
for reasoning or prompted via chain-of-thought (CoT), have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on many complex reasoning tasks. However, we
uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon: explicit CoT
reasoning can significantly degrade instruction-following accuracy. Evaluating
15 models on two benchmarks: IFEval (with simple, rule-verifiable constraints)
and ComplexBench (with complex, compositional constraints), we consistently
observe performance drops when CoT prompting is applied. Through large-scale
case studies and an attention-based analysis, we identify common patterns where
reasoning either helps (e.g., with formatting or lexical precision) or hurts
(e.g., by neglecting simple constraints or introducing unnecessary content). We
propose a metric, constraint attention, to quantify model focus during
generation and show that CoT reasoning often diverts attention away from
instruction-relevant tokens. To mitigate these effects, we introduce and
evaluate four strategies: in-context learning, self-reflection, self-selective
reasoning, and classifier-selective reasoning. Our results demonstrate that
selective reasoning strategies, particularly classifier-selective reasoning,
can substantially recover lost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first
work to systematically expose reasoning-induced failures in
instruction-following and offer practical mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between data compression and the capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial, especially in specialized domains
like code intelligence. Prior work posited a linear relationship between
compression and general intelligence. However, it overlooked the multifaceted
nature of code that encompasses diverse programming languages and tasks, and
struggled with fair evaluation of modern Code LLMs. We address this by
evaluating a diverse array of open-source Code LLMs on comprehensive
multi-language, multi-task code benchmarks. To address the challenge of
efficient and fair evaluation of pre-trained LLMs' code intelligence, we
introduce \textit{Format Annealing}, a lightweight, transparent training
methodology designed to assess the intrinsic capabilities of these pre-trained
models equitably. Compression efficacy, measured as bits-per-character (BPC),
is determined using a novel, large-scale, and previously unseen code validation
set derived from GitHub. Our empirical results reveal a fundamental logarithmic
relationship between measured code intelligence and BPC. This finding refines
prior hypotheses of linearity, which we suggest are likely observations of the
logarithmic curve's tail under specific, limited conditions. Our work provides
a more nuanced understanding of compression's role in developing code
intelligence and contributes a robust evaluation framework in the code domain.

PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating
11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using
a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human
performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require
complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1)
and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent
gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, m1 scores 60.5
on knowledge but only 47.1 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are
misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply,
while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address
this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on
reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly

Abstract: Preference datasets are essential for training general-domain,
instruction-following language models with Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF). Each subsequent data release raises expectations for future
data collection, meaning there is a constant need to advance the quality and
diversity of openly available preference data. To address this need, we
introduce HelpSteer3-Preference, a permissively licensed (CC-BY-4.0),
high-quality, human-annotated preference dataset comprising of over 40,000
samples. These samples span diverse real-world applications of large language
models (LLMs), including tasks relating to STEM, coding and multilingual
scenarios. Using HelpSteer3-Preference, we train Reward Models (RMs) that
achieve top performance on RM-Bench (82.4%) and JudgeBench (73.7%). This
represents a substantial improvement (~10% absolute) over the previously
best-reported results from existing RMs. We demonstrate HelpSteer3-Preference
can also be applied to train Generative RMs and how policy models can be
aligned with RLHF using our RMs. Dataset (CC-BY-4.0):

Conclusion: 强化学习可以释放LLMs在汇编代码性能优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of programming tasks, yet their potential for code optimization
remains underexplored. This work investigates whether LLMs can optimize the
performance of assembly code, where fine-grained control over execution enables
improvements that are difficult to express in high-level languages. We present
a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), guided by a reward function that considers both functional
correctness, validated through test cases, and execution performance relative
to the industry-standard compiler gcc -O3. To support this study, we introduce
a benchmark of 8,072 real-world programs. Our model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO,
achieves 96.0% test pass rates and an average speedup of 1.47x over the gcc -O3
baseline, outperforming all 20 other models evaluated, including
Claude-3.7-sonnet. These results indicate that reinforcement learning can
unlock the potential of LLMs to serve as effective optimizers for assembly code
performance.

Motivation: 现有连续潜在空间推理方法（如SoftCoT）由于固定潜在表示限制了多样化探索，而SoftCoT++旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过多个专用初始令牌扰动潜在思维，并应用对比学习促进软思维表示的多样性。

Result: 在五个推理基准和两种LLM架构上，SoftCoT++显著优于SoftCoT，且与传统扩展技术（如自一致性）兼容。

Conclusion: SoftCoT++为连续潜在空间推理提供了多样化探索的有效方法，提升了性能。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) refers to approaches that improve reasoning
performance by allocating extra computation during inference, without altering
the model's parameters. While existing TTS methods operate in a discrete token
space by generating more intermediate steps, recent studies in Coconut and
SoftCoT have demonstrated that thinking in the continuous latent space can
further enhance the reasoning performance. Such latent thoughts encode
informative thinking without the information loss associated with
autoregressive token generation, sparking increased interest in
continuous-space reasoning. Unlike discrete decoding, where repeated sampling
enables exploring diverse reasoning paths, latent representations in continuous
space are fixed for a given input, which limits diverse exploration, as all
decoded paths originate from the same latent thought. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce SoftCoT++ to extend SoftCoT to the Test-Time Scaling
paradigm by enabling diverse exploration of thinking paths. Specifically, we
perturb latent thoughts via multiple specialized initial tokens and apply
contrastive learning to promote diversity among soft thought representations.
Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks and two distinct LLM architectures
demonstrate that SoftCoT++ significantly boosts SoftCoT and also outperforms
SoftCoT with self-consistency scaling. Moreover, it shows strong compatibility
with conventional scaling techniques such as self-consistency. Source code is

Method: 提出两种攻击方法：直接的DPMA和基于遗传算法的GAPMA，后者通过优化描述增强隐蔽性。

Result: 实验表明GAPMA在攻击效果和隐蔽性之间取得平衡，揭示了MCP生态的潜在风险。

Conclusion: 研究强调了MCP生态系统的安全漏洞，呼吁开发防御机制以确保公平性。

Abstract: Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes interface mapping for large
language models (LLMs) to access external data and tools, which revolutionizes
the paradigm of tool selection and facilitates the rapid expansion of the LLM
agent tool ecosystem. However, as the MCP is increasingly adopted, third-party
customized versions of the MCP server expose potential security
vulnerabilities. In this paper, we first introduce a novel security threat,
which we term the MCP Preference Manipulation Attack (MPMA). An attacker
deploys a customized MCP server to manipulate LLMs, causing them to prioritize
it over other competing MCP servers. This can result in economic benefits for
attackers, such as revenue from paid MCP services or advertising income
generated from free servers. To achieve MPMA, we first design a Direct
Preference Manipulation Attack ($\mathtt{DPMA}$) that achieves significant
effectiveness by inserting the manipulative word and phrases into the tool name
and description. However, such a direct modification is obvious to users and
lacks stealthiness. To address these limitations, we further propose
Genetic-based Advertising Preference Manipulation Attack ($\mathtt{GAPMA}$).
$\mathtt{GAPMA}$ employs four commonly used strategies to initialize
descriptions and integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to enhance stealthiness.
The experiment results demonstrate that $\mathtt{GAPMA}$ balances high
effectiveness and stealthiness. Our study reveals a critical vulnerability of
the MCP in open ecosystems, highlighting an urgent need for robust defense
mechanisms to ensure the fairness of the MCP ecosystem.

Conclusion: 解码算法的选择对LLM输出质量至关重要，现有算法在理论基础上存在不足。

Abstract: Probabilistic next-token prediction trained using cross-entropy loss is the
basis of most large language models. Given a sequence of previous values,
next-token prediction assigns a probability to each possible next value in the
vocabulary. There are many ways to use next-token prediction to output token
sequences. This paper examines a few of these algorithms (greedy, lookahead,
random sampling, and temperature-scaled random sampling) and studies their
consistency with respect to various goals encoded as loss functions. Although
consistency of surrogate losses with respect to a target loss function is a
well researched topic, we are the first to study it in the context of LLMs (to
the best of our knowledge). We find that, so long as next-token prediction
converges to its true probability distribution, random sampling is consistent
with outputting sequences that mimic sampling from the true probability
distribution. For the other goals, such as minimizing the 0-1 loss on the
entire sequence, we show no polynomial-time algorithm is optimal for all
probability distributions and all decoding algorithms studied are only optimal
for a subset of probability distributions. When analyzing these results, we see
that there is a dichotomy created between the goals of information retrieval
and creative generation for the decoding algorithms. This shows that choosing
the correct decoding algorithm based on the desired goal is extremely important
and many of the ones used are lacking theoretical grounding in numerous
scenarios.

Conclusion: MediPhi框架为临床领域提供了一种高效、低成本的语言模型适配方案。

Abstract: High computation costs and latency of large language models such as GPT-4
have limited their deployment in clinical settings. Small language models
(SLMs) offer a cost-effective alternative, but their limited capacity requires
biomedical domain adaptation, which remains challenging. An additional
bottleneck is the unavailability and high sensitivity of clinical data. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for adapting SLMs into
high-performing clinical models. We introduce the MediPhi collection of
3.8B-parameter SLMs developed with our novel framework: pre-instruction tuning
of experts on relevant medical and clinical corpora (PMC, Medical Guideline,
MedWiki, etc.), model merging, and clinical-tasks alignment. To cover most
clinical tasks, we extended the CLUE benchmark to CLUE+, doubling its size. Our
expert models deliver relative improvements on this benchmark over the base
model without any task-specific fine-tuning: 64.3% on medical entities, 49.5%
on radiology reports, and 44% on ICD-10 coding (outperforming GPT-4-0125 by
14%). We unify the expert models into MediPhi via model merging, preserving
gains across benchmarks. Furthermore, we built the MediFlow collection, a
synthetic dataset of 2.5 million high-quality instructions on 14 medical NLP
tasks, 98 fine-grained document types, and JSON format support. Alignment of
MediPhi using supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization
achieves further gains of 18.9% on average.

Abstract: Semantic feature norms have been foundational in the study of human
conceptual knowledge, yet traditional methods face trade-offs between
concept/feature coverage and verifiability of quality due to the
labor-intensive nature of norming studies. Here, we introduce a novel approach
that augments a dataset of human-generated feature norms with responses from
large language models (LLMs) while verifying the quality of norms against
reliable human judgments. We find that our AI-enhanced feature norm dataset,
NOVA: Norms Optimized Via AI, shows much higher feature density and overlap
among concepts while outperforming a comparable human-only norm dataset and
word-embedding models in predicting people's semantic similarity judgments.
Taken together, we demonstrate that human conceptual knowledge is richer than
captured in previous norm datasets and show that, with proper validation, LLMs
can serve as powerful tools for cognitive science research.

Conclusion: SIAR和R$^3$方法有效解决了规则检索中的语义差距问题，提升了检索和推理的准确性。

Abstract: This paper systematically addresses the challenges of rule retrieval, a
crucial yet underexplored area. Vanilla retrieval methods using sparse or dense
retrievers to directly search for relevant rules to support downstream
reasoning, often suffer from low accuracy. This is primarily due to a
significant semantic gap between the instantiated facts in the queries and the
abstract representations of the rules. Such misalignment results in suboptimal
retrieval quality, which in turn negatively impacts reasoning performance. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Self-Induction Augmented Retrieval
(SIAR), a novel approach that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to induce
potential inferential rules that might offer benefits for reasoning by
abstracting the underlying knowledge and logical structure in queries. These
induced rules are then used for query augmentation to improve retrieval
effectiveness. Additionally, we introduce Rule Relevance ReEstimate (R$^3$), a
method that re-estimates the relevance of retrieved rules by assessing whether
the abstract knowledge they contain can be instantiated to align with the facts
in the queries and the helpfulness for reasoning. Extensive experiments across
various settings demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed
methods.

Abstract: Recently, large-scale pre-trained speech encoders and Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been released, which show state-of-the-art performance on a range
of spoken language processing tasks including Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR). To effectively combine both models for better performance, continuous
speech prompts, and ASR error correction have been adopted. However, these
methods are prone to suboptimal performance or are inflexible. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm, LegoSLM, that bridges speech encoders and LLMs using
the ASR posterior matrices. The speech encoder is trained to generate
Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) posteriors over the LLM vocabulary,
which are used to reconstruct pseudo-audio embeddings by computing a weighted
sum of the LLM input embeddings. These embeddings are concatenated with text
embeddings in the LLM input space. Using the well-performing USM and Gemma
models as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed LegoSLM method yields
good performance on both ASR and speech translation tasks. By connecting USM
with Gemma models, we can get an average of 49% WERR over the USM-CTC baseline
on 8 MLS testsets. The trained model also exhibits modularity in a range of
settings -- after fine-tuning the Gemma model weights, the speech encoder can
be switched and combined with the LLM in a zero-shot fashion. Additionally, we
propose to control the decode-time influence of the USM and LLM using a softmax
temperature, which shows effectiveness in domain adaptation.

Abstract: Effective communication about breast and cervical cancers remains a
persistent health challenge, with significant gaps in public understanding of
cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, potentially leading to delayed
diagnoses and inadequate treatments. This study evaluates the capabilities and
limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate, safe, and
accessible cancer-related information to support patient understanding. We
evaluated five general-purpose and three medical LLMs using a mixed-methods
evaluation framework across linguistic quality, safety and trustworthiness, and
communication accessibility and affectiveness. Our approach utilized
quantitative metrics, qualitative expert ratings, and statistical analysis
using Welch's ANOVA, Games-Howell, and Hedges' g. Our results show that
general-purpose LLMs produced outputs of higher linguistic quality and
affectiveness, while medical LLMs demonstrate greater communication
accessibility. However, medical LLMs tend to exhibit higher levels of potential
harm, toxicity, and bias, reducing their performance in safety and
trustworthiness. Our findings indicate a duality between domain-specific
knowledge and safety in health communications. The results highlight the need
for intentional model design with targeted improvements, particularly in
mitigating harm and bias, and improving safety and affectiveness. This study
provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for cancer communication, offering
critical insights for improving AI-generated health content and informing
future development of accurate, safe, and accessible digital health tools.

Abstract: Audio deepfake detection (ADD) has grown increasingly important due to the
rise of high-fidelity audio generative models and their potential for misuse.
Given that audio large language models (ALLMs) have made significant progress

$\mathcal{A}LLM4ADD$, an ALLM-driven framework for ADD. Specifically, we
reformulate ADD task as an audio question answering problem, prompting the
model with the question: "Is this audio fake or real?". We then perform
supervised fine-tuning to enable the ALLM to assess the authenticity of query
audio. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our ALLM-based
method can achieve superior performance in fake audio detection, particularly
in data-scarce scenarios. As a pioneering study, we anticipate that this work

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in morphological
inflection tasks, yet their ability to generalize across languages and
morphological rules remains limited. One possible explanation for this behavior
can be the degree to which these models are able to capture implicit phenomena
at the phonological and subphonemic levels. We introduce a language-agnostic
probing method to investigate phonological feature encoding in transformers
trained directly on phonemes, and perform it across seven morphologically
diverse languages. We show that phonological features which are local, such as
final-obstruent devoicing in Turkish, are captured well in phoneme embeddings,
whereas long-distance dependencies like vowel harmony are better represented in
the transformer's encoder. Finally, we discuss how these findings inform
empirical strategies for training morphological models, particularly regarding
the role of subphonemic feature acquisition.

Abstract: The task of Critical Questions Generation (CQs-Gen) aims to foster critical
thinking by enabling systems to generate questions that expose assumptions and
challenge the reasoning in arguments. Despite growing interest in this area,
progress has been hindered by the lack of suitable datasets and automatic
evaluation standards. This work presents a comprehensive approach to support
the development and benchmarking of systems for this task. We construct the
first large-scale manually-annotated dataset. We also investigate automatic
evaluation methods and identify a reference-based technique using large
language models (LLMs) as the strategy that best correlates with human
judgments. Our zero-shot evaluation of 11 LLMs establishes a strong baseline
while showcasing the difficulty of the task. Data, code, and a public
leaderboard are provided to encourage further research not only in terms of
model performance, but also to explore the practical benefits of CQs-Gen for
both automated reasoning and human critical thinking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs和CoT方法在生成创意表达（如幽默和讽刺）方面表现不足，且现有基准缺乏多模态和多样性。

Method: 引入GODBench基准（视频和文本模态）和RoT多步推理框架（受物理波传播启发）。

Result: 实验表明现有MLLMs和CoT方法在创意评论生成上仍有挑战，而RoT显著提升创造力。

Conclusion: RoT为MLLM的创意生成提供了有效方法，GODBench为评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: Video Comment Art enhances user engagement by providing creative content that
conveys humor, satire, or emotional resonance, requiring a nuanced and
comprehensive grasp of cultural and contextual subtleties. Although Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have demonstrated
strong reasoning abilities in STEM tasks (e.g. mathematics and coding), they
still struggle to generate creative expressions such as resonant jokes and
insightful satire. Moreover, existing benchmarks are constrained by their
limited modalities and insufficient categories, hindering the exploration of
comprehensive creativity in video-based Comment Art creation. To address these
limitations, we introduce GODBench, a novel benchmark that integrates video and
text modalities to systematically evaluate MLLMs' abilities to compose Comment
Art. Furthermore, inspired by the propagation patterns of waves in physics, we
propose Ripple of Thought (RoT), a multi-step reasoning framework designed to
enhance the creativity of MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal that existing
MLLMs and CoT methods still face significant challenges in understanding and
generating creative video comments. In contrast, RoT provides an effective
approach to improve creative composing, highlighting its potential to drive
meaningful advancements in MLLM-based creativity. GODBench is publicly

Result: Transformer模型优于早期模型，但仍无法完全解释人类预测能力，表明其预测方式与人类不同。

Conclusion: 尽管技术进步，当前语言模型在模拟人类语言理解方面仍有局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have led to the
development of highly sophisticated language models for text generation. In
parallel, neuroscience has increasingly employed these models to explore
cognitive processes involved in language comprehension. Previous research has
shown that models such as N-grams and LSTM networks can partially account for
predictability effects in explaining eye movement behaviors, specifically Gaze
Duration, during reading. In this study, we extend these findings by evaluating
transformer-based models (GPT2, LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA2-7B) to further investigate
this relationship. Our results indicate that these architectures outperform
earlier models in explaining the variance in Gaze Durations recorded from
Rioplantense Spanish readers. However, similar to previous studies, these
models still fail to account for the entirety of the variance captured by human
predictability. These findings suggest that, despite their advancements,
state-of-the-art language models continue to predict language in ways that
differ from human readers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to materials science
questions, including literature comprehension, property prediction, materials
discovery and alloy design. At the same time, a wide range of physics-based
computational approaches have been developed in which materials properties can
be calculated. Here, we propose a benchmark application to evaluate the
proficiency of LLMs to answer materials science questions through the
generation and safe execution of codes based on such physics-based
computational materials science packages. MatTools is built on two
complementary components: a materials simulation tool question-answer (QA)
benchmark and a real-world tool-usage benchmark. We designed an automated
methodology to efficiently collect real-world materials science tool-use
examples. The QA benchmark, derived from the pymatgen (Python Materials
Genomics) codebase and documentation, comprises 69,225 QA pairs that assess the
ability of an LLM to understand materials science tools. The real-world
benchmark contains 49 tasks (138 subtasks) requiring the generation of
functional Python code for materials property calculations. Our evaluation of
diverse LLMs yields three key insights: (1)Generalists outshine
specialists;(2)AI knows AI; and (3)Simpler is better. MatTools provides a
standardized framework for assessing and improving LLM capabilities for
materials science tool applications, facilitating the development of more
effective AI systems for materials science and general scientific research.

Abstract: Patent claims define the scope of protection and establish the legal
boundaries of an invention. Drafting these claims is a complex and
time-consuming process that usually requires the expertise of skilled patent
attorneys, which can form a large access barrier for many small enterprises. To
solve these challenges, researchers have investigated the use of large language
models (LLMs) for automating patent claim generation. However, existing studies
highlight inconsistencies between automated evaluation metrics and human expert
assessments. To bridge this gap, we introduce Patent-CE, the first
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating patent claims. Patent-CE includes
comparative claim evaluations annotated by patent experts, focusing on five key
criteria: feature completeness, conceptual clarity, terminology consistency,
logical linkage, and overall quality. Additionally, we propose PatClaimEval, a
novel multi-dimensional evaluation method specifically designed for patent
claims. Our experiments demonstrate that PatClaimEval achieves the highest
correlation with human expert evaluations across all assessment criteria among
all tested metrics. This research provides the groundwork for more accurate
evaluations of automated patent claim generation systems.

Conclusion: 训练数据量是减少自动评分系统偏见的关键因素。

Abstract: This study investigated potential scoring biases and disparities toward
English Language Learners (ELLs) when using automatic scoring systems for
middle school students' written responses to science assessments. We
specifically focus on examining how unbalanced training data with ELLs
contributes to scoring bias and disparities. We fine-tuned BERT with four
datasets: responses from (1) ELLs, (2) non-ELLs, (3) a mixed dataset reflecting
the real-world proportion of ELLs and non-ELLs (unbalanced), and (4) a balanced
mixed dataset with equal representation of both groups. The study analyzed 21
assessment items: 10 items with about 30,000 ELL responses, five items with
about 1,000 ELL responses, and six items with about 200 ELL responses. Scoring
accuracy (Acc) was calculated and compared to identify bias using Friedman
tests. We measured the Mean Score Gaps (MSGs) between ELLs and non-ELLs and
then calculated the differences in MSGs generated through both the human and AI
models to identify the scoring disparities. We found that no AI bias and
distorted disparities between ELLs and non-ELLs were found when the training
dataset was large enough (ELL = 30,000 and ELL = 1,000), but concerns could
exist if the sample size is limited (ELL = 200).

Abstract: We present GeoGrid-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of
foundation models to understand geo-spatial data in the grid structure.
Geo-spatial datasets pose distinct challenges due to their dense numerical

time to complex spatiotemporal comparisons across regions and periods. Our
evaluation reveals that vision-language models perform best overall, and we
provide a fine-grained analysis of the strengths and limitations of different
foundation models in different geo-spatial tasks. This benchmark offers clearer
insights into how foundation models can be effectively applied to geo-spatial
data analysis and used to support scientific research.

retrieval at SemEval 2025, aimed at identifying fact-checked claims that match
newly encountered claims expressed in social media posts across different
languages. The task includes two subtracks: (1) a monolingual track, where
social posts and claims are in the same language, and (2) a crosslingual track,
where social posts and claims might be in different languages. A total of 179
participants registered for the task contributing to 52 test submissions. 23
out of 31 teams have submitted their system papers. In this paper, we report
the best-performing systems as well as the most common and the most effective
approaches across both subtracks. This shared task, along with its dataset and
participating systems, provides valuable insights into multilingual claim

Abstract: When knowledge graphs (KGs) are automatically extracted from text, are they
accurate enough for downstream analysis? Unfortunately, current annotated
datasets can not be used to evaluate this question, since their KGs are highly
disconnected, too small, or overly complex. To address this gap, we introduce
AffilKG (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15427977), which is a collection of six
datasets that are the first to pair complete book scans with large, labeled
knowledge graphs. Each dataset features affiliation graphs, which are simple
KGs that capture Member relationships between Person and Organization entities
-- useful in studies of migration, community interactions, and other social
phenomena. In addition, three datasets include expanded KGs with a wider
variety of relation types. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate significant
variability in model performance across datasets, underscoring AffilKG's
ability to enable two critical advances: (1) benchmarking how extraction errors
propagate to graph-level analyses (e.g., community structure), and (2)
validating KG extraction methods for real-world social science research.

Result: 多模态方法显著优于单模态，但生成模型在精度上落后于监督方法和指令调优模型，尽管能有效处理社交媒体常见问题。

Conclusion: 生成模型在多模态任务中潜力有限，但在处理社交媒体特有噪声方面表现较好。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the challenges of detecting events on social media,
where traditional unimodal systems struggle due to the rapid and multimodal
nature of data dissemination. We employ a range of models, including unimodal
ModernBERT and ConvNeXt-V2, multimodal fusion techniques, and advanced
generative models like GPT-4o, and LLaVA. Additionally, we also study the
effect of providing multimodal generative models (such as GPT-4o) with a single
modality to assess their efficacy. Our results indicate that while multimodal
approaches notably outperform unimodal counterparts, generative approaches
despite having a large number of parameters, lag behind supervised methods in
precision. Furthermore, we also found that they lag behind instruction-tuned
models because of their inability to generate event classes correctly. During
our error analysis, we discovered that common social media issues such as leet
speak, text elongation, etc. are effectively handled by generative approaches
but are hard to tackle using supervised approaches.

investigate the reconstruction of complete syllable sequences from various
incomplete input types, including consonant sequences, vowel sequences, partial
syllables (with random character deletions), and masked syllables (with fixed
syllable deletions). Our experiments reveal that consonant sequences play a
critical role in accurate syllable prediction, achieving high BLEU scores,
while vowel sequences present a significantly greater challenge. The model
demonstrates robust performance across tasks, particularly in handling partial

consonant information and syllable masking. This study advances the
understanding of sequence prediction for Abugida languages and provides
practical insights for applications such as text prediction, spelling

Abstract: Early Risk Detection (ERD) on the Web aims to identify promptly users facing
social and health issues. Users are analyzed post-by-post, and it is necessary
to guarantee correct and quick answers, which is particularly challenging in
critical scenarios. ERD involves optimizing classification precision and
minimizing detection delay. Standard classification metrics may not suffice,
resorting to specific metrics such as ERDE(theta) that explicitly consider
precision and delay. The current research focuses on applying a multi-objective
approach, prioritizing classification performance and establishing a separate
criterion for decision time. In this work, we propose a completely different
strategy, temporal fine-tuning, which allows tuning transformer-based models by
explicitly incorporating time within the learning process. Our method allows us
to analyze complete user post histories, tune models considering different
contexts, and evaluate training performance using temporal metrics. We
evaluated our proposal in the depression and eating disorders tasks for the
Spanish language, achieving competitive results compared to the best models of
MentalRiskES 2023. We found that temporal fine-tuning optimized decisions
considering context and time progress. In this way, by properly taking
advantage of the power of transformers, it is possible to address ERD by
combining precision and speed as a single objective.

Abstract: This work explores the journey towards achieving Bahnaric-Vietnamese
translation for the sake of culturally bridging the two ethnic groups in
Vietnam. However, translating from Bahnaric to Vietnamese also encounters some
difficulties. The most prominent challenge is the lack of available original
Bahnaric resources source language, including vocabulary, grammar, dialogue
patterns and bilingual corpus, which hinders the data collection process for
training. To address this, we leverage a transfer learning approach using
sequence-to-sequence pre-training language model. First of all, we leverage a
pre-trained Vietnamese language model to capture the characteristics of this
language. Especially, to further serve the purpose of machine translation, we
aim for a sequence-to-sequence model, not encoder-only like BERT or
decoder-only like GPT. Taking advantage of significant similarity between the
two languages, we continue training the model with the currently limited
bilingual resources of Vietnamese-Bahnaric text to perform the transfer
learning from language model to machine translation. Thus, this approach can
help to handle the problem of imbalanced resources between two languages, while
also optimizing the training and computational processes. Additionally, we also
enhanced the datasets using data augmentation to generate additional resources
and defined some heuristic methods to help the translation more precise. Our
approach has been validated to be highly effective for the Bahnaric-Vietnamese
translation model, contributing to the expansion and preservation of languages,
and facilitating better mutual understanding between the two ethnic people.

Abstract: Timely and accurate situation awareness is vital for decision-making in
humanitarian response, conflict monitoring, and early warning and early action.
However, the manual analysis of vast and heterogeneous data sources often
results in delays, limiting the effectiveness of interventions. This paper
introduces a dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that
autonomously generates situation awareness reports by integrating real-time
data from diverse sources, including news articles, conflict event databases,
and economic indicators. Our system constructs query-specific knowledge bases
on demand, ensuring timely, relevant, and accurate insights.
  To ensure the quality of generated reports, we propose a three-level
evaluation framework that combines semantic similarity metrics, factual
consistency checks, and expert feedback. The first level employs automated NLP
metrics to assess coherence and factual accuracy. The second level involves
human expert evaluation to verify the relevance and completeness of the

Conclusion: 未来研究需解决开放挑战，以构建更鲁棒和可扩展的多说话人ASR系统。

Abstract: Monaural multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains challenging
due to data scarcity and the intrinsic difficulty of recognizing and
attributing words to individual speakers, particularly in overlapping speech.
Recent advances have driven the shift from cascade systems to end-to-end (E2E)
architectures, which reduce error propagation and better exploit the synergy
between speech content and speaker identity. Despite rapid progress in E2E
multi-speaker ASR, the field lacks a comprehensive review of recent
developments. This survey provides a systematic taxonomy of E2E neural
approaches for multi-speaker ASR, highlighting recent advances and comparative
analysis. Specifically, we analyze: (1) architectural paradigms (SIMO vs.~SISO)
for pre-segmented audio, analyzing their distinct characteristics and
trade-offs; (2) recent architectural and algorithmic improvements based on
these two paradigms; (3) extensions to long-form speech, including segmentation
strategy and speaker-consistent hypothesis stitching. Further, we (4) evaluate
and compare methods across standard benchmarks. We conclude with a discussion
of open challenges and future research directions towards building robust and
scalable multi-speaker ASR.

Conclusion: CQO的系统性研究为阿拉伯文字的计算语言学分析提供了新方法，尤其是在手稿对齐和比较方面。

Abstract: Contemporary Quranic Orthography (CQO) relies on a precise system of phonetic
notation that can be traced back to the early stages of Islam, when the Quran
was mainly oral in nature and the first written renderings of it served as
memory aids for this oral tradition. The early systems of diacritical marks
created on top of the Quranic Consonantal Text (QCT) motivated the creation and
further development of a fine-grained system of phonetic notation that
represented tajwid-the rules of recitation. We explored the systematicity of
the rules of tajwid, as they are encountered in the Cairo Quran, using a fully
and accurately encoded digital edition of the Quranic text. For this purpose,
we developed a python module that can remove or add the orthographic layer of
tajwid from a Quranic text in CQO. The interesting characteristic of these two
sets of rules is that they address the complete Quranic text of the Cairo
Quran, so they can be used as precise witnesses to study its phonetic and
prosodic processes. From a computational point of view, the text of the Cairo
Quran can be used as a linchpin to align and compare Quranic manuscripts, due
to its richness and completeness. This will let us create a very powerful
framework to work with the Arabic script, not just within an isolated text, but
automatically exploring a specific textual phenomenon in other connected
manuscripts. Having all the texts mapped among each other can serve as a
powerful tool to study the nature of the notation systems of diacritics added
to the consonantal skeleton.

Motivation: 当前MLLMs在模态对齐中存在偏向文本信息的问题，导致视觉等其他模态的信息融合效果不佳。本文旨在通过理论分析和改进方法解决这一问题。

Method: 通过信息论分析交叉熵损失的隐含对齐目标，提出VISTA方法，引入显式对齐目标以最大化跨模态互信息。

Result: VISTA在多个基准数据集（如VQAv2、MMStar和MME）上显著优于基线模型，提升了视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: VISTA为MLLMs的模态对齐研究提供了新方向，且无需额外训练模块或数据，高效实用。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face a critical challenge in
modality alignment, often exhibiting a bias towards textual information at the
expense of other modalities like vision. This paper conducts a systematic
information-theoretic analysis of the widely used cross-entropy loss in MLLMs,
uncovering its implicit alignment objective. Our theoretical investigation
reveals that this implicit objective has inherent limitations, leading to a
degradation of cross-modal alignment as text sequence length increases, thereby
hindering effective multimodal information fusion. To overcome these drawbacks,
we propose Vision-Text Alignment (VISTA), a novel approach guided by our
theoretical insights. VISTA introduces an explicit alignment objective designed
to maximize cross-modal mutual information, preventing the degradation of
visual alignment. Notably, VISTA enhances the visual understanding capabilities
of existing MLLMs without requiring any additional trainable modules or extra
training data, making it both efficient and practical. Our method significantly
outperforms baseline models across more than a dozen benchmark datasets,
including VQAv2, MMStar, and MME, paving the way for new directions in MLLM
modal alignment research.

Result: 实验显示当前MLLMs在多模态推理任务中的表现与人类存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 该基准为下一代模型的开发提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The goal of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is to imitate
humans and surpass them. Models such as OpenAI's o1, o3, and DeepSeek's R1 have
demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) with human-like reasoning
capabilities exhibit exceptional performance and are being gradually integrated
into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, whether these models
possess capabilities comparable to humans in handling reasoning tasks remains
unclear at present. In this paper, we propose Human-Aligned Bench, a benchmark
for fine-grained alignment of multimodal reasoning with human performance.
Specifically, we collected 9,794 multimodal questions that solely rely on
contextual reasoning, including bilingual (Chinese and English) multimodal
questions and pure text-based questions, encompassing four question types:
visual reasoning, definition judgment, analogical reasoning, and logical
judgment. More importantly, each question is accompanied by human success rates
and options that humans are prone to choosing incorrectly. Extensive
experiments on the Human-Aligned Bench reveal notable differences between the
performance of current MLLMs in multimodal reasoning and human performance. The
findings on our benchmark provide insights into the development of the
next-generation models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态基模型转移（DBMS）方法，通过调整基模型和压缩参数来优化Delta压缩性能，显著提升高压缩率下的模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Delta压缩方法默认使用预训练模型作为基模型，可能导致性能显著下降，尤其是在高压缩率下。本文研究了不同基模型对压缩性能的影响，发现预训练基模型通常不是最优选择。

Method: 提出动态基模型转移（DBMS），动态调整基模型以适应目标任务，并通过学习两个参数（基模型转移幅度和压缩规模）来优化压缩性能。

Result: DBMS在高压缩率下仍能保持微调模型的大部分性能，显著优于现有方法，且适用于多种模型（语言、视觉Transformer和多模态模型）。

Conclusion: DBMS是一种通用且高效的Delta压缩方法，可与其他技术结合，显著提升压缩性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based models with the pretrain-finetune paradigm bring about
significant progress, along with the heavy storage and deployment costs of
finetuned models on multiple tasks. Delta compression attempts to lower the
costs by reducing the redundancy of delta parameters (i.e., the difference
between the finetuned and pre-trained model weights) through pruning or
quantization. However, existing methods by default employ the pretrained model
as the base model and compress the delta parameters for every task, which may
causes significant performance degradation, especially when the compression
rate is extremely high. To tackle this issue, we investigate the impact of
different base models on the performance of delta compression and find that the
pre-trained base model can hardly be optimal. To this end, we propose Dynamic
Base Model Shift (DBMS), which dynamically adapts the base model to the target
task before performing delta compression. Specifically, we adjust two
parameters, which respectively determine the magnitude of the base model shift
and the overall scale of delta compression, to boost the compression
performance on each task. Through low-cost learning of these two parameters,
our DBMS can maintain most of the finetuned model's performance even under an
extremely high compression ratio setting, significantly surpassing existing
methods. Moreover, our DBMS is orthogonal and can be integrated with a variety
of other methods, and it has been evaluated across different types of models
including language, vision transformer, and multi-modal models.

Motivation: LVLMs中的语言先验导致模型生成视觉不一致但语言合理的内容，这一问题源于预训练LLM的固有特性。

Method: CICD通过识别关键和有害先验，并利用对比解码消除有害先验，同时保持文本流畅性和视觉信息完整性。

Result: 在四个基准测试和六种LVLM上验证了CICD的有效性，尤其在图像描述任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: CICD是一种简单有效的方法，能够显著缓解语言先验问题，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Language priors constitute one of the primary causes of hallucinations in
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), driving the models to generate
linguistically plausible yet visually inconsistent content. The language priors
in LVLMs originate from the linguistic knowledge inherited from their
pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) backbone. Consequently, this
characteristic is an intrinsic property of the model that remains independent
of visual inputs. Inspired by the finding that language priors are consistent
across images, we propose Cross-Image Contrastive Decoding (CICD), a simple yet
effective training-free method to alleviate language priors in LVLMs. CICD
first identifies essential and detrimental priors, and then employs contrastive
decoding to eliminate the detrimental ones. This approach simultaneously
prevents LVLMs from generating hallucinated content while maintaining textual
fluency and coherence. Furthermore, the limited information overlap between
images helps prevent visual information loss during contrastive decoding. We
validate the effectiveness of CICD on four benchmarks with six LVLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate that CICD performs remarkably well in mitigating
language priors, especially in the image captioning task, where such priors are
most pronounced. Code will be released once accepted.

Conclusion: 多模态模型可能确实实现了模态间的共同表示，概念简单性可能是跨模态的固有属性。

Abstract: Large language models have become multimodal, and many of them are said to
integrate their modalities using common representations. If this were true, a
drawing of a car as an image, for instance, should map to the similar area in
the latent space as a textual description of the strokes that conform the
drawing. To explore this in a black-box access regime to these models, we
propose the use of machine teaching, a theory that studies the minimal set of
examples a teacher needs to choose so that the learner captures the concept. In
this paper we evaluate the complexity of teaching visual-language models a
subset of objects in the Quick, Draw! dataset using two presentations: raw
images as bitmaps and trace coordinates in TikZ format. The results indicate
that image-based representations generally require fewer segments and achieve
higher accuracy than coordinate-based representations. But, surprisingly, the
teaching size usually ranks concepts similarly across both modalities, even
when controlling for (a human proxy of) concept priors, suggesting that the
simplicity of concepts may be an inherent property that transcends modality
representations.

Result: GPO在Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium上提升了20%的计数和文本渲染能力，且推理时无额外开销。

Conclusion: GPO是一种高效的自改进方法，适用于多种扩散模型和任务。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) has shown notable improvements in generation quality.
However, applying DPO to T2I faces two challenges: the sensitivity of DPO to
preference pairs and the labor-intensive process of collecting and annotating
high-quality data. In this work, we demonstrate that preference pairs with
marginal differences can degrade DPO performance. Since DPO relies exclusively
on relative ranking while disregarding the absolute difference of pairs, it may
misclassify losing samples as wins, or vice versa. We empirically show that
extending the DPO from pairwise to groupwise and incorporating reward
standardization for reweighting leads to performance gains without explicit
data selection. Furthermore, we propose Group Preference Optimization (GPO), an
effective self-improvement method that enhances performance by leveraging the
model's own capabilities without requiring external data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GPO is effective across various diffusion models and tasks.
Specifically, combining with widely used computer vision models, such as YOLO
and OCR, the GPO improves the accurate counting and text rendering capabilities
of the Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium by 20 percentage points. Notably, as a
plug-and-play method, no extra overhead is introduced during inference.

Conclusion: DiCo展示了卷积在扩散模型中的潜力，为高效视觉生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT), a promising diffusion model for visual
generation, demonstrates impressive performance but incurs significant
computational overhead. Intriguingly, analysis of pre-trained DiT models
reveals that global self-attention is often redundant, predominantly capturing
local patterns-highlighting the potential for more efficient alternatives. In
this paper, we revisit convolution as an alternative building block for
constructing efficient and expressive diffusion models. However, naively
replacing self-attention with convolution typically results in degraded
performance. Our investigations attribute this performance gap to the higher
channel redundancy in ConvNets compared to Transformers. To resolve this, we
introduce a compact channel attention mechanism that promotes the activation of
more diverse channels, thereby enhancing feature diversity. This leads to
Diffusion ConvNet (DiCo), a family of diffusion models built entirely from
standard ConvNet modules, offering strong generative performance with
significant efficiency gains. On class-conditional ImageNet benchmarks, DiCo
outperforms previous diffusion models in both image quality and generation
speed. Notably, DiCo-XL achieves an FID of 2.05 at 256x256 resolution and 2.53
at 512x512, with a 2.7x and 3.1x speedup over DiT-XL/2, respectively.
Furthermore, our largest model, DiCo-H, scaled to 1B parameters, reaches an FID

Abstract: Emotion understanding is a critical yet challenging task. Recent advances in
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their
capabilities in this area. However, MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations,
generating irrelevant or nonsensical content. To the best of our knowledge,
despite the importance of this issue, there has been no dedicated effort to
evaluate emotion-related hallucinations in MLLMs. In this work, we introduce
EmotionHallucer, the first benchmark for detecting and analyzing emotion
hallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike humans, whose emotion understanding stems from
the interplay of biology and social learning, MLLMs rely solely on data-driven
learning and lack innate emotional instincts. Fortunately, emotion psychology
provides a solid foundation of knowledge about human emotions. Building on
this, we assess emotion hallucinations from two dimensions: emotion psychology
knowledge and real-world multimodal perception. To support robust evaluation,
we utilize an adversarial binary question-answer (QA) framework, which employs
carefully crafted basic and hallucinated pairs to assess the emotion
hallucination tendencies of MLLMs. By evaluating 38 LLMs and MLLMs on
EmotionHallucer, we reveal that: i) most current models exhibit substantial
issues with emotion hallucinations; ii) closed-source models outperform
open-source ones in detecting emotion hallucinations, and reasoning capability
provides additional advantages; iii) existing models perform better in emotion
psychology knowledge than in multimodal emotion perception. As a byproduct,
these findings inspire us to propose the PEP-MEK framework, which yields an
average improvement of 9.90% in emotion hallucination detection across selected
models. Resources will be available at

Abstract: The rapid extension of context windows in large vision-language models has
given rise to long-context vision-language models (LCVLMs), which are capable
of handling hundreds of images with interleaved text tokens in a single forward
pass. In this work, we introduce MMLongBench, the first benchmark covering a
diverse set of long-context vision-language tasks, to evaluate LCVLMs
effectively and thoroughly. MMLongBench is composed of 13,331 examples spanning
five different categories of downstream tasks, such as Visual RAG and Many-Shot
ICL. It also provides broad coverage of image types, including various natural
and synthetic images. To assess the robustness of the models to different input
lengths, all examples are delivered at five standardized input lengths (8K-128K
tokens) via a cross-modal tokenization scheme that combines vision patches and
text tokens. Through a thorough benchmarking of 46 closed-source and
open-source LCVLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current models'
vision-language long-context ability. Our results show that: i) performance on
a single task is a weak proxy for overall long-context capability; ii) both

Motivation: 视频扩散模型的计算和内存需求高，现有量化方法直接应用于视频扩散模型效果不佳，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 提出QVGen框架，通过引入辅助模块（Φ）减少量化误差，并采用秩衰减策略逐步消除Φ，以保持性能并消除推理开销。

Result: 在4位量化下，QVGen首次达到与全精度模型相当的质量，并在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: QVGen为视频扩散模型的低比特量化提供了高效解决方案，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. Yet,
their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to
real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution,
quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while
its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we
present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for
high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit
quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis
demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate
convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to
mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced
convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a
rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we
repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based
regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing
components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference
overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs,
with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the
first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings.
Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our
3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and
$+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.

Motivation: 现有生物医学分割基础模型在未见域数据上表现不佳，缺乏视觉语言知识。MLLMs的多模态理解和推理能力为解决这一问题提供了灵感。

Method: 提出Vision-Language Semantic Alignment（VLSA）模块和Semantic Boundary Regularization（SBR），通过MLLMs为SAM注入VLK，并优化边界感知。

Conclusion: uLLSAM通过结合MLLMs和SAM，显著提升了跨域分割性能，为生物医学图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of regions of interest in biomedical images holds
substantial value in image analysis. Although several foundation models for
biomedical segmentation have currently achieved excellent performance on
certain datasets, they typically demonstrate sub-optimal performance on unseen
domain data. We owe the deficiency to lack of vision-language knowledge before
segmentation. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) bring outstanding
understanding and reasoning capabilities to multimodal tasks, which inspires us
to leverage MLLMs to inject Vision-Language Knowledge (VLK), thereby enabling
vision models to demonstrate superior generalization capabilities on
cross-domain datasets. In this paper, we propose using MLLMs to guide SAM in
learning microscopy crose-domain data, unifying Segment Anything in Microscopy,
named uLLSAM. Specifically, we propose the Vision-Language Semantic Alignment
(VLSA) module, which injects VLK into Segment Anything Model (SAM). We find
that after SAM receives global VLK prompts, its performance improves
significantly, but there are deficiencies in boundary contour perception.
Therefore, we further propose Semantic Boundary Regularization (SBR) to prompt
SAM. Our method achieves performance improvements of 7.71% in Dice and 12.10%
in SA across 9 in-domain microscopy datasets, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Our method also demonstrates improvements of 6.79% in Dice and
10.08% in SA across 10 out-ofdomain datasets, exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities. Code is available at https://github.com/ieellee/uLLSAM.

Abstract: Foundation models, pretrained on extensive datasets, have significantly
advanced machine learning by providing robust and transferable embeddings
applicable to various domains, including medical imaging diagnostics. This
study evaluates the utility of embeddings derived from both general-purpose and
medical domain-specific foundation models for training lightweight adapter
models in multi-class radiography classification, focusing specifically on tube
placement assessment. A dataset comprising 8842 radiographs classified into
seven distinct categories was employed to extract embeddings using six
foundation models: DenseNet121, BiomedCLIP, Med-Flamingo, MedImageInsight,
Rad-DINO, and CXR-Foundation. Adapter models were subsequently trained using
classical machine learning algorithms. Among these combinations,
MedImageInsight embeddings paired with an support vector machine adapter
yielded the highest mean area under the curve (mAUC) at 93.8%, followed closely
by Rad-DINO (91.1%) and CXR-Foundation (89.0%). In comparison, BiomedCLIP and
DenseNet121 exhibited moderate performance with mAUC scores of 83.0% and 81.8%,
respectively, whereas Med-Flamingo delivered the lowest performance at 75.1%.
Notably, most adapter models demonstrated computational efficiency, achieving
training within one minute and inference within seconds on CPU, underscoring
their practicality for clinical applications. Furthermore, fairness analyses on
adapters trained on MedImageInsight-derived embeddings indicated minimal
disparities, with gender differences in performance within 2% and standard
deviations across age groups not exceeding 3%. These findings confirm that
foundation model embeddings-especially those from MedImageInsight-facilitate
accurate, computationally efficient, and equitable diagnostic classification
using lightweight adapters for radiographic image analysis.

Conclusion: 自条件机制有效整合了判别性技术（如对比自蒸馏），在不牺牲生成质量的情况下提升了扩散模型的表征能力。

Abstract: While diffusion models have gained prominence in image synthesis, their
generative pre-training has been shown to yield discriminative representations,
paving the way towards unified visual generation and understanding. However,
two key questions remain: 1) Can these representations be leveraged to improve
the training of diffusion models themselves, rather than solely benefiting
downstream tasks? 2) Can the feature quality be enhanced to rival or even
surpass modern self-supervised learners, without compromising generative
capability? This work addresses these questions by introducing
self-conditioning, a straightforward yet effective mechanism that internally
leverages the rich semantics inherent in denoising network to guide its own
decoding layers, forming a tighter bottleneck that condenses high-level
semantics to improve generation. Results are compelling: our method boosts both
generation FID and recognition accuracy with 1% computational overhead and
generalizes across diverse diffusion architectures. Crucially,
self-conditioning facilitates an effective integration of discriminative
techniques, such as contrastive self-distillation, directly into diffusion
models without sacrificing generation quality. Extensive experiments on
pixel-space and latent-space datasets show that in linear evaluations, our
enhanced diffusion models, particularly UViT and DiT, serve as strong
representation learners, surpassing various self-supervised models.

Conclusion: Hybrid-Emba3D通过几何特征耦合和跨路径混合显著提升点云分类性能，同时保持高效性。

Abstract: The point cloud classification tasks face the dual challenge of efficiently
extracting local geometric features while maintaining model complexity. The
Mamba architecture utilizes the linear complexity advantage of state space
models (SSMs) to overcome the computational bottleneck of Transformers while
balancing global modeling capabilities. However, the inherent contradiction
between its unidirectional dependency and the unordered nature of point clouds
impedes modeling spatial correlation in local neighborhoods, thus constraining
geometric feature extraction. This paper proposes Hybrid-Emba3D, a
bidirectional Mamba model enhanced by geometry-feature coupling and cross-path
feature hybridization. The Local geometric pooling with geometry-feature
coupling mechanism significantly enhances local feature discriminative power
via coordinated propagation and dynamic aggregation of geometric information
between local center points and their neighborhoods, without introducing
additional parameters. The designed Collaborative feature enhancer adopts
dual-path hybridization, effectively handling local mutations and sparse key
signals, breaking through the limitations of traditional SSM long-range
modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a
new SOTA classification accuracy of 95.99% on ModelNet40 with only 0.03M

Conclusion: Co-Erasing通过视觉监督有效解决了文本与图像模态间的知识差距问题，提升了概念擦除的效果。

Abstract: Concept erasing has recently emerged as an effective paradigm to prevent
text-to-image diffusion models from generating visually undesirable or even
harmful content. However, current removal methods heavily rely on manually
crafted text prompts, making it challenging to achieve a high erasure
(efficacy) while minimizing the impact on other benign concepts (usability). In
this paper, we attribute the limitations to the inherent gap between the text
and image modalities, which makes it hard to transfer the intricately entangled
concept knowledge from text prompts to the image generation process. To address
this, we propose a novel solution by directly integrating visual supervision
into the erasure process, introducing the first text-image Collaborative
Concept Erasing (Co-Erasing) framework. Specifically, Co-Erasing describes the
concept jointly by text prompts and the corresponding undesirable images
induced by the prompts, and then reduces the generating probability of the
target concept through negative guidance. This approach effectively bypasses
the knowledge gap between text and image, significantly enhancing erasure
efficacy. Additionally, we design a text-guided image concept refinement
strategy that directs the model to focus on visual features most relevant to
the specified text concept, minimizing disruption to other benign concepts.
Finally, comprehensive experiments suggest that Co-Erasing outperforms
state-of-the-art erasure approaches significantly with a better trade-off
between efficacy and usability. Codes are available at

Abstract: False negatives pose a critical challenge in vision-language pretraining
(VLP) due to the many-to-many correspondence between images and texts in
large-scale datasets. These false negatives introduce conflicting supervision
signals that degrade the learned embedding space and diminish the effectiveness
of hard negative sampling. In this paper, we propose FALCON (False-negative
Aware Learning of COntrastive Negatives), a learning-based mini-batch
construction strategy that adaptively balances the trade-off between hard and
false negatives during VLP. Rather than relying on fixed heuristics, FALCON
employs a negative mining scheduler that dynamically selects negative samples
of appropriate hardness for each anchor instance during mini-batch
construction, guided by a proxy for cross-modal alignment improvement.
Experimental results demonstrate that FALCON significantly improves performance
across two widely adopted VLP frameworks (ALBEF, BLIP-2) and a broad range of
downstream tasks and evaluation settings, underscoring its effectiveness and
robustness in mitigating the impact of false negatives.

Abstract: Diffusion models have made substantial advances in image generation, yet
models trained on large, unfiltered datasets often yield outputs misaligned
with human preferences. Numerous methods have been proposed to fine-tune
pre-trained diffusion models, achieving notable improvements in aligning
generated outputs with human preferences. However, we argue that existing
preference alignment methods neglect the critical role of handling
unconditional/negative-conditional outputs, leading to a diminished capacity to
avoid generating undesirable outcomes. This oversight limits the efficacy of
classifier-free guidance~(CFG), which relies on the contrast between
conditional generation and unconditional/negative-conditional generation to
optimize output quality. In response, we propose a straightforward but
versatile effective approach that involves training a model specifically
attuned to negative preferences. This method does not require new training
strategies or datasets but rather involves minor modifications to existing
techniques. Our approach integrates seamlessly with models such as SD1.5, SDXL,
video diffusion models and models that have undergone preference optimization,
consistently enhancing their alignment with human preferences.

Conclusion: B3方法通过优化批次构建，显著提升了对比学习的性能，减少了对大批次的依赖。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) is a prevalent technique for training embedding
models, which pulls semantically similar examples (positives) closer in the
representation space while pushing dissimilar ones (negatives) further apart. A
key source of negatives are 'in-batch' examples, i.e., positives from other
examples in the batch. Effectiveness of such models is hence strongly
influenced by the size and quality of training batches. In this work, we
propose 'Breaking the Batch Barrier' (B3), a novel batch construction strategy
designed to curate high-quality batches for CL. Our approach begins by using a
pretrained teacher embedding model to rank all examples in the dataset, from
which a sparse similarity graph is constructed. A community detection algorithm
is then applied to this graph to identify clusters of examples that serve as
strong negatives for one another. The clusters are then used to construct
batches that are rich in in-batch negatives. Empirical results on the MMEB
multimodal embedding benchmark (36 tasks) demonstrate that our method sets a
new state of the art, outperforming previous best methods by +1.3 and +2.9
points at the 7B and 2B model scales, respectively. Notably, models trained
with B3 surpass existing state-of-the-art results even with a batch size as
small as 64, which is 4-16x smaller than that required by other methods.

contrastive test cases across a comprehensive taxonomy of image properties.
With CROC, we generate a pseudo-labeled dataset (CROC$^{syn}$) of over one
million contrastive prompt-image pairs to enable a fine-grained comparison of
evaluation metrics. We also use the dataset to train CROCScore, a new metric
that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods,
demonstrating an additional key application of our framework. To complement
this dataset, we introduce a human-supervised benchmark (CROC$^{hum}$)
targeting especially challenging categories. Our results highlight robustness
issues in existing metrics: for example, many fail on prompts involving
negation, and all tested open-source metrics fail on at least 25% of cases

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in offline tasks
such as image captioning and video question answering. However, real-time
interactive environments impose new demands on VLMs, requiring them to generate
utterances that are not only semantically accurate but also precisely timed. We
identify two core capabilities necessary for such settings --
$\textit{perceptual updating}$ and $\textit{contingency awareness}$ -- and
propose a new benchmark task, $\textbf{Temporally-Grounded Language Generation
(TGLG)}$, to evaluate them. TGLG requires models to generate utterances in
response to streaming video such that both content and timing align with
dynamic visual input. To support this benchmark, we curate evaluation datasets
from sports broadcasting and egocentric human interaction domains, and
introduce a new metric, $\textbf{TRACE}$, to evaluate TGLG by jointly measuring
semantic similarity and temporal alignment. Finally, we present
$\textbf{Vision-Language Model with Time-Synchronized Interleaving (VLM-TSI)}$,
a model that interleaves visual and linguistic tokens in a time-synchronized
manner, enabling real-time language generation without relying on turn-based
assumptions. Experimental results show that VLM-TSI significantly outperforms a

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core task where embodied agents
leverage their spatial mobility to navigate in 3D environments toward
designated destinations based on natural language instructions. Recently,
video-language large models (Video-VLMs) with strong generalization
capabilities and rich commonsense knowledge have shown remarkable performance
when applied to VLN tasks. However, these models still encounter the following
challenges when applied to real-world 3D navigation: 1) Insufficient
understanding of 3D geometry and spatial semantics; 2) Limited capacity for
large-scale exploration and long-term environmental memory; 3) Poor
adaptability to dynamic and changing environments.To address these limitations,
we propose Dynam3D, a dynamic layered 3D representation model that leverages
language-aligned, generalizable, and hierarchical 3D representations as visual
input to train 3D-VLM in navigation action prediction. Given posed RGB-D
images, our Dynam3D projects 2D CLIP features into 3D space and constructs
multi-level 3D patch-instance-zone representations for 3D geometric and
semantic understanding with a dynamic and layer-wise update strategy. Our
Dynam3D is capable of online encoding and localization of 3D instances, and
dynamically updates them in changing environments to provide large-scale
exploration and long-term memory capabilities for navigation. By leveraging

Conclusion: 高质量数据集和多阶段训练显著提升了病理学模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled broad progress
in the general medical field. However, pathology still remains a more
challenging subdomain, with current pathology specific VLMs exhibiting
limitations in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning plausibility. Such
shortcomings are largely attributable to the nature of current pathology
datasets, which are primarily composed of image description pairs that lack the
depth and structured diagnostic paradigms employed by real world pathologists.
In this study, we leverage pathology textbooks and real world pathology experts
to construct high-quality, reasoning-oriented datasets. Building on this, we
introduce Patho-R1, a multimodal RL-based pathology Reasoner, trained through a
three-stage pipeline: (1) continued pretraining on 3.5 million image-text pairs
for knowledge infusion; (2) supervised fine-tuning on 500k high-quality
Chain-of-Thought samples for reasoning incentivizing; (3) reinforcement
learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization and Decoupled Clip and
Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization strategies for multimodal reasoning
quality refinement. To further assess the alignment quality of our dataset, we
propose PathoCLIP, trained on the same figure-caption corpus used for continued
pretraining. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that both PathoCLIP
and Patho-R1 achieve robust performance across a wide range of
pathology-related tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal
retrieval, Visual Question Answering, and Multiple Choice Question. Our project

Motivation: 解决AI自动分割在临床应用中因训练数据与测试数据特征不同而性能下降的问题。

Method: 使用预训练的Transformer改进为HTN，并在平衡和不平衡数据集上训练模型。

Abstract: AI automated segmentations for radiation treatment planning (RTP) can
deteriorate when applied in clinical cases with different characteristics than
training dataset. Hence, we refined a pretrained transformer into a hybrid
transformer convolutional network (HTN) to segment cardiac substructures lung
and breast cancer patients acquired with varying imaging contrasts and patient
scan positions. Cohort I, consisting of 56 contrast-enhanced (CECT) and 124
non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans from patients with non-small cell lung cancers
acquired in supine position, was used to create oracle with all 180 training
cases and balanced (CECT: 32, NCCT: 32 training) HTN models. Models were
evaluated on a held-out validation set of 60 cohort I patients and 66 patients
with breast cancer from cohort II acquired in supine (n=45) and prone (n=21)
positions. Accuracy was measured using DSC, HD95, and dose metrics. Publicly
available TotalSegmentator served as the benchmark. The oracle and balanced
models were similarly accurate (DSC Cohort I: 0.80 \pm 0.10 versus 0.81 \pm
0.10; Cohort II: 0.77 \pm 0.13 versus 0.80 \pm 0.12), outperforming
TotalSegmentator. The balanced model, using half the training cases as oracle,
produced similar dose metrics as manual delineations for all cardiac
substructures. This model was robust to CT contrast in 6 out of 8 substructures
and patient scan position variations in 5 out of 8 substructures and showed low
correlations of accuracy to patient size and age. A HTN demonstrated robustly
accurate (geometric and dose metrics) cardiac substructures segmentation from
CTs with varying imaging and patient characteristics, one key requirement for
clinical use. Moreover, the model combining pretraining with balanced
distribution of NCCT and CECT scans was able to provide reliably accurate
segmentations under varied conditions with far fewer labeled datasets compared
to an oracle model.

Abstract: Over the past decades, computer-aided diagnosis tools for breast cancer have
been developed to enhance screening procedures, yet their clinical adoption
remains challenged by data variability and inherent biases. Although foundation
models (FMs) have recently demonstrated impressive generalizability and
transfer learning capabilities by leveraging vast and diverse datasets, their
performance can be undermined by spurious correlations that arise from
variations in image quality, labeling uncertainty, and sensitive patient
attributes. In this work, we explore the fairness and bias of FMs for breast
mammography classification by leveraging a large pool of datasets from diverse
sources-including data from underrepresented regions and an in-house dataset.
Our extensive experiments show that while modality-specific pre-training of FMs
enhances performance, classifiers trained on features from individual datasets
fail to generalize across domains. Aggregating datasets improves overall
performance, yet does not fully mitigate biases, leading to significant
disparities across under-represented subgroups such as extreme breast densities
and age groups. Furthermore, while domain-adaptation strategies can reduce
these disparities, they often incur a performance trade-off. In contrast,
fairness-aware techniques yield more stable and equitable performance across
subgroups. These findings underscore the necessity of incorporating rigorous
fairness evaluations and mitigation strategies into FM-based models to foster
inclusive and generalizable AI.

Conclusion: 为大规模弱标注临床数据集的CL提供了基础，推动了更适应性强和稳健的诊断模型的发展。

Abstract: Advances in medical imaging and deep learning have propelled progress in
whole slide image (WSI) analysis, with multiple instance learning (MIL) showing
promise for efficient and accurate diagnostics. However, conventional MIL
models often lack adaptability to evolving datasets, as they rely on static
training that cannot incorporate new information without extensive retraining.
Applying continual learning (CL) to MIL models is a possible solution, but
often sees limited improvements. In this paper, we analyze CL in the context of
attention MIL models and find that the model forgetting is mainly concentrated
in the attention layers of the MIL model. Using the results of this analysis we
propose two components for improving CL on MIL: Attention Knowledge
Distillation (AKD) and the Pseudo-Bag Memory Pool (PMP). AKD mitigates
catastrophic forgetting by focusing on retaining attention layer knowledge
between learning sessions, while PMP reduces the memory footprint by
selectively storing only the most informative patches, or ``pseudo-bags'' from
WSIs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly
improves both accuracy and memory efficiency on diverse WSI datasets,
outperforming current state-of-the-art CL methods. This work provides a
foundation for CL in large-scale, weakly annotated clinical datasets, paving
the way for more adaptable and resilient diagnostic models.

Abstract: Verifying the authenticity of AI-generated images presents a growing
challenge on social media platforms these days. While vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP outdo in multimodal representation, their capacity for
AI-generated image classification is underexplored due to the absence of such
labels during the pre-training process. This work investigates whether CLIP
embeddings inherently contain information indicative of AI generation. A
proposed pipeline extracts visual embeddings using a frozen CLIP model, feeds
its embeddings to lightweight networks, and fine-tunes only the final
classifier. Experiments on the public CIFAKE benchmark show the performance
reaches 95% accuracy without language reasoning. Few-shot adaptation to curated
custom with 20% of the data results in performance to 85%. A closed-source
baseline (Gemini-2.0) has the best zero-shot accuracy yet fails on specific
styles. Notably, some specific image types, such as wide-angle photographs and
oil paintings, pose significant challenges to classification. These results
indicate previously unexplored difficulties in classifying certain types of
AI-generated images, revealing new and more specific questions in this domain
that are worth further investigation.

Method: 提出稀疏ST-GCNs生成器，从随机初始化的密集网络训练稀疏架构，并集成多级稀疏结构。

Result: 稀疏ST-GCNs在减少95%参数时性能下降<1%，多级稀疏模型仅需66%参数且性能提升>1%。

Conclusion: 稀疏ST-GCNs在高效性和性能上优于密集模型，验证了过参数化假设。

Abstract: Spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs) showcase impressive
performance in skeleton-based human action recognition (HAR). However, despite
the development of numerous models, their recognition performance does not
differ significantly after aligning the input settings. With this observation,
we hypothesize that ST-GCNs are over-parameterized for HAR, a conjecture
subsequently confirmed through experiments employing the lottery ticket
hypothesis. Additionally, a novel sparse ST-GCNs generator is proposed, which
trains a sparse architecture from a randomly initialized dense network while
maintaining comparable performance levels to the dense components. Moreover, we
generate multi-level sparsity ST-GCNs by integrating sparse structures at
various sparsity levels and demonstrate that the assembled model yields a
significant enhancement in HAR performance. Thorough experiments on four
datasets, including NTU-RGB+D 60(120), Kinetics-400, and FineGYM, demonstrate
that the proposed sparse ST-GCNs can achieve comparable performance to their
dense components. Even with 95% fewer parameters, the sparse ST-GCNs exhibit a
degradation of <1% in top-1 accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-level sparsity
ST-GCNs, which require only 66% of the parameters of the dense ST-GCNs,
demonstrate an improvement of >1% in top-1 accuracy. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法在保留SDXL生成能力的同时，实现了高保真度的个性化主题生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable
Diffusion, have enabled the generation of highly detailed and semantically rich
images. However, personalizing these models to represent novel subjects based
on a few reference images remains challenging. This often leads to catastrophic
forgetting, overfitting, or large computational overhead.We propose a two-stage
pipeline that addresses these limitations by leveraging LoRA-based fine-tuning
on the attention weights within the U-Net of the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)
model. First, we use the unmodified SDXL to generate a generic scene by
replacing the subject with its class label. Then, we selectively insert the
personalized subject through a segmentation-driven image-to-image (Img2Img)
pipeline that uses the trained LoRA weights.This framework isolates the subject
encoding from the overall composition, thus preserving SDXL's broader
generative capabilities while integrating the new subject in a high-fidelity
manner. Our method achieves a DINO similarity score of 0.789 on SDXL,
outperforming existing personalized text-to-image approaches.

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) presents significant visual and technical
challenges, including surgical instrument classification and understanding
surgical action involving instruments, verbs, and anatomical targets. While
many machine learning-based methods have been developed for surgical
understanding, they typically rely on procedure- and task-specific models
trained on small, manually annotated datasets. In contrast, the recent success
of vision-language models (VLMs) trained on large volumes of raw image-text
pairs has demonstrated strong adaptability to diverse visual data and a range
of downstream tasks. This opens meaningful research questions: how well do
these general-purpose VLMs perform in the surgical domain? In this work, we
explore those questions by benchmarking several VLMs across diverse surgical
datasets, including general laparoscopic procedures and endoscopic submucosal
dissection, to assess their current capabilities and limitations. Our benchmark
reveals key gaps in the models' ability to consistently link language to the
correct regions in surgical scenes.

Abstract: This work addresses the task of completely weakly supervised
class-incremental learning for semantic segmentation to learn segmentation for
both base and additional novel classes using only image-level labels. While
class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) is crucial for handling diverse
and newly emerging objects in the real world, traditional CISS methods require
expensive pixel-level annotations for training. To overcome this limitation,
partially weakly-supervised approaches have recently been proposed. However, to
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a completely
weakly-supervised method for CISS. To achieve this, we propose to generate
robust pseudo-labels by combining pseudo-labels from a localizer and a sequence
of foundation models based on their uncertainty. Moreover, to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting, we introduce an exemplar-guided data augmentation
method that generates diverse images containing both previous and novel classes
with guidance. Finally, we conduct experiments in three common experimental
settings: 15-5 VOC, 10-10 VOC, and COCO-to-VOC, and in two scenarios: disjoint
and overlap. The experimental results demonstrate that our completely weakly
supervised method outperforms even partially weakly supervised methods in the
15-5 VOC and 10-10 VOC settings while achieving competitive accuracy in the
COCO-to-VOC setting.

Conclusion: EA-3DGS显著提升了户外场景的渲染质量和效率。

Abstract: Efficient scene representations are essential for many real-world
applications, especially those involving spatial measurement. Although current
NeRF-based methods have achieved impressive results in reconstructing
building-scale scenes, they still suffer from slow training and inference
speeds due to time-consuming stochastic sampling. Recently, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated excellent performance with its high-quality
rendering and real-time speed, especially for objects and small-scale scenes.
However, in outdoor scenes, its point-based explicit representation lacks an
effective adjustment mechanism, and the millions of Gaussian points required
often lead to memory constraints during training. To address these challenges,
we propose EA-3DGS, a high-quality real-time rendering method designed for
outdoor scenes. First, we introduce a mesh structure to regulate the
initialization of Gaussian components by leveraging an adaptive tetrahedral
mesh that partitions the grid and initializes Gaussian components on each face,
effectively capturing geometric structures in low-texture regions. Second, we
propose an efficient Gaussian pruning strategy that evaluates each 3D
Gaussian's contribution to the view and prunes accordingly. To retain
geometry-critical Gaussian points, we also present a structure-aware
densification strategy that densifies Gaussian points in low-curvature regions.
Additionally, we employ vector quantization for parameter quantization of
Gaussian components, significantly reducing disk space requirements with only a
minimal impact on rendering quality. Extensive experiments on 13 scenes,
including eight from four public datasets (MatrixCity-Aerial, Mill-19, Tanks \&
Temples, WHU) and five self-collected scenes acquired through UAV
photogrammetry measurement from SCUT-CA and plateau regions, further
demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Abstract: Human motion generation is essential for fields such as animation, robotics,

from text descriptions. Existing approaches often rely on Contrastive
Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based text encoders, but their training on
text-image pairs constrains their ability to understand temporal and kinematic
structures inherent in motion and motion generation. This work introduces
MoCLIP, a fine-tuned CLIP model with an additional motion encoding head,
trained on motion sequences using contrastive learning and tethering loss. By
explicitly incorporating motion-aware representations, MoCLIP enhances motion
fidelity while remaining compatible with existing CLIP-based pipelines and
seamlessly integrating into various CLIP-based methods. Experiments demonstrate
that MoCLIP improves Top-1, Top-2, and Top-3 accuracy while maintaining
competitive FID, leading to improved text-to-motion alignment results. These
results highlight MoCLIP's versatility and effectiveness, establishing it as a
robust framework for enhancing motion generation.

Abstract: People with blindness and low vision (pBLV) face significant challenges,
struggling to navigate environments and locate objects due to limited visual
cues. Spatial reasoning is crucial for these individuals, as it enables them to
understand and interpret the spatial relationships in their surroundings,
enhancing their ability to navigate and interact more safely and independently.
Current multi-modal large language (MLLM) models for low vision people lack the
spatial reasoning capabilities needed to effectively assist in these tasks.
Moreover, there is a notable absence of lightweight, easy-to-use systems that
allow pBLV to effectively perceive and interact with their surrounding

large language model based approach for visually impaired individuals. By
fine-tuning the MLLM to incorporate spatial reasoning capabilities, our method

TL;DR: ForensicHub提出了首个统一的假图像检测与定位基准和代码库，解决了FIDL领域的碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FIDL领域因缺乏统一基准导致领域孤岛，阻碍跨领域比较和发展。

Method: 提出模块化架构，分解法医流程为可互换组件，实现灵活组合；实现10个基线模型、6个主干网络、2个新基准，并集成现有基准。

Result: 提供了8个关键见解，推动FIDL领域模型架构、数据集特性和评估标准的改进。

Conclusion: ForensicHub打破了FIDL领域的孤岛，为未来发展提供基础。

Abstract: The field of Fake Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) is highly
fragmented, encompassing four domains: deepfake detection (Deepfake), image
manipulation detection and localization (IMDL), artificial
intelligence-generated image detection (AIGC), and document image manipulation
localization (Doc). Although individual benchmarks exist in some domains, a
unified benchmark for all domains in FIDL remains blank. The absence of a
unified benchmark results in significant domain silos, where each domain
independently constructs its datasets, models, and evaluation protocols without
interoperability, preventing cross-domain comparisons and hindering the
development of the entire FIDL field. To close the domain silo barrier, we
propose ForensicHub, the first unified benchmark & codebase for all-domain fake
image detection and localization. Considering drastic variations on dataset,
model, and evaluation configurations across all domains, as well as the
scarcity of open-sourced baseline models and the lack of individual benchmarks
in some domains, ForensicHub: i) proposes a modular and configuration-driven
architecture that decomposes forensic pipelines into interchangeable components
across datasets, transforms, models, and evaluators, allowing flexible
composition across all domains; ii) fully implements 10 baseline models, 6
backbones, 2 new benchmarks for AIGC and Doc, and integrates 2 existing
benchmarks of DeepfakeBench and IMDLBenCo through an adapter-based design; iii)
conducts indepth analysis based on the ForensicHub, offering 8 key actionable
insights into FIDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation
standards. ForensicHub represents a significant leap forward in breaking the
domain silos in the FIDL field and inspiring future breakthroughs.

Conclusion: MoMADiff通过结合掩码建模和扩散过程，实现了对3D人体运动的鲁棒生成和精确控制。

Abstract: Generating 3D human motion from text descriptions remains challenging due to
the diverse and complex nature of human motion. While existing methods excel
within the training distribution, they often struggle with out-of-distribution
motions, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Existing
VQVAE-based methods often fail to represent novel motions faithfully using
discrete tokens, which hampers their ability to generalize beyond seen data.
Meanwhile, diffusion-based methods operating on continuous representations
often lack fine-grained control over individual frames. To address these
challenges, we propose a robust motion generation framework MoMADiff, which
combines masked modeling with diffusion processes to generate motion using
frame-level continuous representations. Our model supports flexible
user-provided keyframe specification, enabling precise control over both
spatial and temporal aspects of motion synthesis. MoMADiff demonstrates strong
generalization capability on novel text-to-motion datasets with sparse
keyframes as motion prompts. Extensive experiments on two held-out datasets and
two standard benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in motion quality, instruction fidelity, and keyframe
adherence.

large-scale benchmark for data cleaning in the image domain, built upon the
publicly available Fitzpatrick17k dermatology dataset. We collect 496,377
binary annotations from 933 medical crowd workers, identify off-topic samples

model inspired by item-response theory followed by expert review to derive
high-quality ground truth. CleanPatrick formalizes issue detection as a ranking
task and adopts typical ranking metrics mirroring real audit workflows.
Benchmarking classical anomaly detectors, perceptual hashing, SSIM, Confident
Learning, NoiseRank, and SelfClean, we find that, on CleanPatrick,
self-supervised representations excel at near-duplicate detection, classical
methods achieve competitive off-topic detection under constrained review
budgets, and label-error detection remains an open challenge for fine-grained
medical classification. By releasing both the dataset and the evaluation
framework, CleanPatrick enables a systematic comparison of image-cleaning
strategies and paves the way for more reliable data-centric artificial

Conclusion: CUBIC为无监督偏见识别提供了一种高效方法，适用于视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Deep vision models often rely on biases learned from spurious correlations in
datasets. To identify these biases, methods that interpret high-level,
human-understandable concepts are more effective than those relying primarily
on low-level features like heatmaps. A major challenge for these concept-based
methods is the lack of image annotations indicating potentially bias-inducing
concepts, since creating such annotations requires detailed labeling for each
dataset and concept, which is highly labor-intensive. We present CUBIC (Concept
embeddings for Unsupervised Bias IdentifiCation), a novel method that
automatically discovers interpretable concepts that may bias classifier
behavior. Unlike existing approaches, CUBIC does not rely on predefined bias
candidates or examples of model failures tied to specific biases, as such
information is not always available. Instead, it leverages image-text latent
space and linear classifier probes to examine how the latent representation of
a superclass label$\unicode{x2014}$shared by all instances in the
dataset$\unicode{x2014}$is influenced by the presence of a given concept. By
measuring these shifts against the normal vector to the classifier's decision
boundary, CUBIC identifies concepts that significantly influence model
predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that CUBIC effectively uncovers
previously unknown biases using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without requiring
the samples in the dataset where the classifier underperforms or prior
knowledge of potential biases.

Abstract: Synthetic media generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) pose
significant challenges in verifying authenticity and tracing dataset origins,
raising critical concerns in copyright enforcement, privacy protection, and

identifying the training dataset (e.g., CelebA or FFHQ) of GAN-generated images
through interpretable feature analysis. By integrating spectral transforms
(Fourier/DCT), color distribution metrics, and local feature descriptors
(SIFT), our pipeline extracts discriminative statistical signatures embedded in
synthetic outputs. Supervised classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) achieve
98-99% accuracy in binary classification (real vs. synthetic) and multi-class
dataset attribution across diverse GAN architectures (StyleGAN, AttGAN, GDWCT,
StarGAN, and StyleGAN2). Experimental results highlight the dominance of
frequency-domain features (DCT/FFT) in capturing dataset-specific artifacts,
such as upsampling patterns and spectral irregularities, while color histograms
reveal implicit regularization strategies in GAN training. We further examine
legal and ethical implications, showing how dataset attribution can address
copyright infringement, unauthorized use of personal data, and regulatory
compliance under frameworks like GDPR and California's AB 602. Our framework
advances accountability and governance in generative modeling, with
applications in digital forensics, content moderation, and intellectual

Abstract: The development of foundation models through pretraining of vision-language
models (VLMs) has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS).
VLM pretraining aims to learn image and language alignments from a large number
of image-text pairs. Each pretraining image is often associated with multiple
captions containing redundant information due to repeated or semantically
similar phrases, resulting in increased pretraining and inference time. To
overcome this, we introduce a weighted feature aggregation (WFA) strategy for
VLM pretraining in RS. Our strategy aims to extract and exploit complementary
information from multiple captions per image while reducing redundancies
through feature aggregation with importance weighting. To calculate adaptive
importance weights for different captions of each image, we propose two
techniques: (i) non-parametric uniqueness and (ii) learning-based attention. In
the first technique, importance weights are calculated based on the bilingual
evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores of the captions to emphasize unique
sentences and reduce the influence of repetitive ones. In the second technique,
importance weights are learned through an attention mechanism instead of
relying on hand-crafted features. The effectiveness of the proposed WFA
strategy with the two techniques is analyzed in terms of downstream performance
on text-to-image retrieval in RS. Experimental results show that the proposed
strategy enables efficient and effective pretraining of VLMs in RS. Based on
the experimental analysis, we derive guidelines for selecting appropriate
techniques depending on downstream task requirements and resource constraints.

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have revolutionized
computer vision through innovative architectures and learning objectives, yet
they have not fully leveraged insights from biological visual processing
systems. Recently, a brain-inspired SSL model named PhiNet was proposed; it is
based on a ResNet backbone and operates on static image inputs with strong
augmentation. In this paper, we introduce PhiNet v2, a novel Transformer-based
architecture that processes temporal visual input (that is, sequences of
images) without relying on strong augmentation. Our model leverages variational
inference to learn robust visual representations from continuous input streams,
similar to human visual processing. Through extensive experimentation, we
demonstrate that PhiNet v2 achieves competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art vision foundation models, while maintaining the ability to
learn from sequential input without strong data augmentation. This work
represents a significant step toward more biologically plausible computer
vision systems that process visual information in a manner more closely aligned

Abstract: State-of-the-art T2I models are capable of generating high-resolution images
given textual prompts. However, they still struggle with accurately depicting
compositional scenes that specify multiple objects, attributes, and spatial
relations. We present CompAlign, a challenging benchmark with an emphasis on
assessing the depiction of 3D-spatial relationships, for evaluating and
improving models on compositional image generation. CompAlign consists of 900
complex multi-subject image generation prompts that combine numerical and
3D-spatial relationships with varied attribute bindings. Our benchmark is
remarkably challenging, incorporating generation tasks with 3+ generation
subjects with complex 3D-spatial relationships. Additionally, we propose
CompQuest, an interpretable and accurate evaluation framework that decomposes
complex prompts into atomic sub-questions, then utilizes a MLLM to provide
fine-grained binary feedback on the correctness of each aspect of generation
elements in model-generated images. This enables precise quantification of
alignment between generated images and compositional prompts. Furthermore, we
propose an alignment framework that uses CompQuest's feedback as preference
signals to improve diffusion models' compositional image generation abilities.
Using adjustable per-image preferences, our method is easily scalable and
flexible for different tasks. Evaluation of 9 T2I models reveals that: (1)
models remarkable struggle more with compositional tasks with more complex
3D-spatial configurations, and (2) a noticeable performance gap exists between
open-source accessible models and closed-source commercial models. Further
empirical study on using CompAlign for model alignment yield promising results:
post-alignment diffusion models achieve remarkable improvements in
compositional accuracy, especially on complex generation tasks, outperforming
previous approaches.

Abstract: Geodesic distance serves as a reliable means of measuring distance in
nonlinear spaces, and such nonlinear manifolds are prevalent in the current
multimodal learning. In these scenarios, some samples may exhibit high
similarity, yet they convey different semantics, making traditional distance
metrics inadequate for distinguishing between positive and negative samples.
This paper introduces geodesic distance as a novel distance metric in
multi-modal learning for the first time, to mine correlations between samples,
aiming to address the limitations of common distance metric. Our approach
incorporates a comprehensive series of strategies to adapt geodesic distance
for the current multimodal learning. Specifically, we construct a graph
structure to represent the adjacency relationships among samples by
thresholding distances between them and then apply the shortest-path algorithm
to obtain geodesic distance within this graph. To facilitate efficient
computation, we further propose a hierarchical graph structure through
clustering and combined with incremental update strategies for dynamic status
updates. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks validate the
effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating its capability to capture
complex relationships between samples and improve the performance of multimodal
learning models.

Abstract: Image enhancement methods often prioritize pixel level information,
overlooking the semantic features. We propose a novel, unsupervised,
fuzzy-inspired image enhancement framework guided by NSGA-II algorithm that
optimizes image brightness, contrast, and gamma parameters to achieve a balance
between visual quality and semantic fidelity. Central to our proposed method is
the use of a pre trained deep neural network as a feature extractor. To find
the best enhancement settings, we use a GPU-accelerated NSGA-II algorithm that
balances multiple objectives, namely, increasing image entropy, improving
perceptual similarity, and maintaining appropriate brightness. We further
improve the results by applying a local search phase to fine-tune the top
candidates from the genetic algorithm. Our approach operates entirely without
paired training data making it broadly applicable across domains with limited
or noisy labels. Quantitatively, our model achieves excellent performance with
average BRISQUE and NIQE scores of 19.82 and 3.652, respectively, in all
unpaired datasets. Qualitatively, enhanced images by our model exhibit
significantly improved visibility in shadowed regions, natural balance of
contrast and also preserve the richer fine detail without introducing noticable
artifacts. This work opens new directions for unsupervised image enhancement

Abstract: The remarkable ease of use of diffusion models for image generation has led
to a proliferation of synthetic content online. While these models are often
employed for legitimate purposes, they are also used to generate fake images
that support misinformation and hate speech. Consequently, it is crucial to
develop robust tools capable of detecting whether an image has been generated
by such models. Many current detection methods, however, require large volumes
of sample images for training. Unfortunately, due to the rapid evolution of the
field, existing datasets often cover only a limited range of models and quickly
become outdated. In this work, we introduce DRAGON, a comprehensive dataset
comprising images from 25 diffusion models, spanning both recent advancements
and older, well-established architectures. The dataset contains a broad variety
of images representing diverse subjects. To enhance image realism, we propose a
simple yet effective pipeline that leverages a large language model to expand
input prompts, thereby generating more diverse and higher-quality outputs, as
evidenced by improvements in standard quality metrics. The dataset is provided
in multiple sizes (ranging from extra-small to extra-large) to accomodate
different research scenarios. DRAGON is designed to support the forensic
community in developing and evaluating detection and attribution techniques for
synthetic content. Additionally, the dataset is accompanied by a dedicated test

Conclusion: FairHyp重新定义了HSI建模中的公平性，为高维视觉任务提供了新范式。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) representation is fundamentally challenged by
pervasive non-uniformity, where spectral dependencies, spatial continuity, and
feature efficiency exhibit complex and often conflicting behaviors. Most
existing models rely on a unified processing paradigm that assumes homogeneity
across dimensions, leading to suboptimal performance and biased
representations. To address this, we propose FairHyp, a fairness-directed
framework that explicitly disentangles and resolves the threefold
non-uniformity through cooperative yet specialized modules. We introduce a
Runge-Kutta-inspired spatial variability adapter to restore spatial coherence
under resolution discrepancies, a multi-receptive field convolution module with
sparse-aware refinement to enhance discriminative features while respecting
inherent sparsity, and a spectral-context state space model that captures
stable and long-range spectral dependencies via bidirectional Mamba scanning
and statistical aggregation. Unlike one-size-fits-all solutions, FairHyp
achieves dimension-specific adaptation while preserving global consistency and
mutual reinforcement. This design is grounded in the view that non-uniformity
arises from the intrinsic structure of HSI representations, rather than any
particular task setting. To validate this, we apply FairHyp across four
representative tasks including classification, denoising, super-resolution, and
inpaintin, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling a shared structural
flaw. Extensive experiments show that FairHyp consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods under varied imaging conditions. Our findings redefine
fairness as a structural necessity in HSI modeling and offer a new paradigm for
balancing adaptability, efficiency, and fidelity in high-dimensional vision
tasks.

Abstract: This work aims at a challenging task: human action-reaction synthesis, i.e.,
generating human reactions based on the action sequence of the other as
conditions. Currently, autoregressive modeling approaches have achieved
remarkable performance in motion generation tasks, e.g. text-to-motion.
However, vector quantization (VQ) accompanying autoregressive generation has
inherent disadvantages, including loss of quantization information, low
codebook utilization, etc. Moreover, unlike text-to-motion, which focuses
solely on the movement of body joints, human action-reaction synthesis also
encompasses fine-grained hand movements. In this work, we propose MARRS, a
novel framework designed to generate coordinated and fine-grained reaction
motions in continuous representations. Initially, we present the
Unit-distinguished Motion Variational AutoEncoder (UD-VAE), which segments the
entire body into distinct body and hand units, encoding them independently.
Subsequently, we propose Action-Conditioned Fusion (ACF), which involves
randomly masking a subset of reactive tokens and extracting specific
information about the body and hands from the active tokens. Furthermore, we
introduce Adaptive Unit Modulation (AUM) to facilitate interaction between body
and hand units by using the information from one unit to adaptively modulate
the other. Finally, for the diffusion model, we employ a compact MLP as a noise
predictor for each distinct body unit and incorporate the diffusion loss to
model the probability distribution of each token. Quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Accurate pose estimation of surgical tools in Robot-assisted Minimally
Invasive Surgery (RMIS) is essential for surgical navigation and robot control.
While traditional marker-based methods offer accuracy, they face challenges
with occlusions, reflections, and tool-specific designs. Similarly, supervised
learning methods require extensive training on annotated datasets, limiting
their adaptability to new tools. Despite their success in other domains,
zero-shot pose estimation models remain unexplored in RMIS for pose estimation
of surgical instruments, creating a gap in generalising to unseen surgical
tools. This paper presents a novel 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose estimation
pipeline for surgical instruments, leveraging state-of-the-art zero-shot RGB-D
models like the FoundationPose and SAM-6D. We advanced these models by
incorporating vision-based depth estimation using the RAFT-Stereo method, for
robust depth estimation in reflective and textureless environments.
Additionally, we enhanced SAM-6D by replacing its instance segmentation module,
Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a fine-tuned Mask R-CNN, significantly
boosting segmentation accuracy in occluded and complex conditions. Extensive
validation reveals that our enhanced SAM-6D surpasses FoundationPose in
zero-shot pose estimation of unseen surgical instruments, setting a new
benchmark for zero-shot RGB-D pose estimation in RMIS. This work enhances the
generalisability of pose estimation for unseen objects and pioneers the
application of RGB-D zero-shot methods in RMIS.

Abstract: Diffusion models have made remarkable advancements in generating high-quality
images from textual descriptions. Recent works like LayerDiffuse have extended
the previous single-layer, unified image generation paradigm to transparent
image layer generation. However, existing multi-layer generation methods fail
to handle the interactions among multiple layers such as rational global
layout, physics-plausible contacts and visual effects like shadows and
reflections while maintaining high alpha quality. To solve this problem, we
propose PSDiffusion, a unified diffusion framework for simultaneous multi-layer
text-to-image generation. Our model can automatically generate multi-layer
images with one RGB background and multiple RGBA foregrounds through a single
feed-forward process. Unlike existing methods that combine multiple tools for
post-decomposition or generate layers sequentially and separately, our method
introduces a global-layer interactive mechanism that generates layered-images
concurrently and collaboratively, ensuring not only high quality and
completeness for each layer, but also spatial and visual interactions among
layers for global coherence.

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used as priors in imaging inverse problems.
However, their performance often degrades under distribution shifts between the
training and test-time images. Existing methods for identifying and quantifying
distribution shifts typically require access to clean test images, which are
almost never available while solving inverse problems (at test time). We
propose a fully unsupervised metric for estimating distribution shifts using
only indirect (corrupted) measurements and score functions from diffusion
models trained on different datasets. We theoretically show that this metric
estimates the KL divergence between the training and test image distributions.
Empirically, we show that our score-based metric, using only corrupted
measurements, closely approximates the KL divergence computed from clean
images. Motivated by this result, we show that aligning the out-of-distribution
score with the in-distribution score -- using only corrupted measurements --
reduces the KL divergence and leads to improved reconstruction quality across
multiple inverse problems.

Abstract: Editing images using natural language instructions has become a natural and
expressive way to modify visual content; yet, evaluating the performance of
such models remains challenging. Existing evaluation approaches often rely on
image-text similarity metrics like CLIP, which lack precision. In this work, we
introduce a new benchmark designed to evaluate text-guided image editing models
in a more grounded manner, along two critical dimensions: (i) functional
correctness, assessed via automatically generated multiple-choice questions
that verify whether the intended change was successfully applied; and (ii)
image content preservation, which ensures that non-targeted regions of the
image remain visually consistent using an object-aware masking technique and
preservation scoring. The benchmark includes over 1000 high-quality editing
examples across 20 diverse content categories, each annotated with detailed
editing instructions, evaluation questions, and spatial object masks. We
conduct a large-scale study comparing GPT-Image-1, the latest flagship in the
text-guided image editing space, against several state-of-the-art editing
models, and validate our automatic metrics against human ratings. Results show
that GPT-Image-1 leads in instruction-following accuracy, but often

Abstract: Hyperspectral image processing and analysis has important application value
in remote sensing, agriculture and environmental monitoring, but its high
dimensionality, data redundancy and noise interference etc. bring great
challenges to the analysis. Traditional models have limitations in dealing with
these complex data, and it is difficult to meet the increasing demand for
analysis. In recent years, Diffusion Model, as an emerging generative model,
has shown unique advantages in hyperspectral image processing. By simulating
the diffusion process of data in time, the Diffusion Model can effectively
process high-dimensional data, generate high-quality samples, and perform well
in denoising and data enhancement. In this paper, we review the recent research
advances in diffusion modeling for hyperspectral image processing and analysis,
and discuss its applications in tasks such as high-dimensional data processing,
noise removal, classification, and anomaly detection. The performance of
diffusion-based models on image processing is compared and the challenges are
summarized. It is shown that the diffusion model can significantly improve the
accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral image analysis, providing a new

Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art generative models on data modalities
such as images, audio, proteins and materials. These modalities share the
property of exponentially decaying variance and magnitude in the Fourier
domain. Under the standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)
forward process of additive white noise, this property results in
high-frequency components being corrupted faster and earlier in terms of their
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) than low-frequency ones. The reverse process then
generates low-frequency information before high-frequency details. In this
work, we study the inductive bias of the forward process of diffusion models in
Fourier space. We theoretically analyse and empirically demonstrate that the
faster noising of high-frequency components in DDPM results in violations of
the normality assumption in the reverse process. Our experiments show that this
leads to degraded generation quality of high-frequency components. We then
study an alternate forward process in Fourier space which corrupts all
frequencies at the same rate, removing the typical frequency hierarchy during
generation, and demonstrate marked performance improvements on datasets where
high frequencies are primary, while performing on par with DDPM on standard
imaging benchmarks.

Conclusion: 未来可探索通过单张输入图像构建辐射场（如扩散模型或通用辐射场）来进一步改进抓取提取。

Abstract: Vision based robot manipulation uses cameras to capture one or more images of
a scene containing the objects to be manipulated. Taking multiple images can
help if any object is occluded from one viewpoint but more visible from another
viewpoint. However, the camera has to be moved to a sequence of suitable
positions for capturing multiple images, which requires time and may not always
be possible, due to reachability constraints. So while additional images can
produce more accurate grasp poses due to the extra information available, the
time-cost goes up with the number of additional views sampled. Scene
representations like Gaussian Splatting are capable of rendering accurate
photorealistic virtual images from user-specified novel viewpoints. In this
work, we show initial results which indicate that novel view synthesis can
provide additional context in generating grasp poses. Our experiments on the
Graspnet-1billion dataset show that novel views contributed force-closure
grasps in addition to the force-closure grasps obtained from sparsely sampled
real views while also improving grasp coverage. In the future we hope this work
can be extended to improve grasp extraction from radiance fields constructed
with a single input image, using for example diffusion models or generalizable
radiance fields.

Abstract: Emotion recognition through physiological signals such as
electroencephalogram (EEG) has become an essential aspect of affective
computing and provides an objective way to capture human emotions. However,
physiological data characterized by cross-subject variability and noisy labels
hinder the performance of emotion recognition models. Existing domain
adaptation and continual learning methods struggle to address these issues,
especially under realistic conditions where data is continuously streamed and
unlabeled. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel bi-level
self-supervised continual learning framework, SSOCL, based on a dynamic memory
buffer. This bi-level architecture iteratively refines the dynamic buffer and
pseudo-label assignments to effectively retain representative samples, enabling
generalization from continuous, unlabeled physiological data streams for
emotion recognition. The assigned pseudo-labels are subsequently leveraged for
accurate emotion prediction. Key components of the framework, including a fast
adaptation module and a cluster-mapping module, enable robust learning and
effective handling of evolving data streams. Experimental validation on two
mainstream EEG tasks demonstrates the framework's ability to adapt to
continuous data streams while maintaining strong generalization across
subjects, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: This study introduces an enhanced approach to video super-resolution by
extending ordinary Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) Super-Resolution
Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) structure to handle spatio-temporal
data. While SRGAN has proven effective for single-image enhancement, its design
does not account for the temporal continuity required in video processing. To
address this, a modified framework that incorporates 3D Non-Local Blocks is
proposed, which is enabling the model to capture relationships across both
spatial and temporal dimensions. An experimental training pipeline is
developed, based on patch-wise learning and advanced data degradation
techniques, to simulate real-world video conditions and learn from both local
and global structures and details. This helps the model generalize better and
maintain stability across varying video content while maintaining the general
structure besides the pixel-wise correctness. Two model variants-one larger and
one more lightweight-are presented to explore the trade-offs between
performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate improved temporal
coherence, sharper textures, and fewer visual artifacts compared to traditional
single-image methods. This work contributes to the development of practical,
learning-based solutions for video enhancement tasks, with potential
applications in streaming, gaming, and digital restoration.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is critical in both civilian and
military applications. However, the limited texture and structural information
in infrared images makes accurate detection particularly challenging. Although
recent deep learning-based methods have improved performance, their use of
conventional convolution kernels limits adaptability to complex scenes and
diverse targets. Moreover, pooling operations often cause feature loss and
insufficient exploitation of image information. To address these issues, we
propose an adaptive receptive field convolution and wavelet-attentive
hierarchical network for infrared small target detection (ARFC-WAHNet). This
network incorporates a multi-receptive field feature interaction convolution
(MRFFIConv) module to adaptively extract discriminative features by integrating
multiple convolutional branches with a gated unit. A wavelet frequency
enhancement downsampling (WFED) module leverages Haar wavelet transform and
frequency-domain reconstruction to enhance target features and suppress
background noise. Additionally, we introduce a high-low feature fusion (HLFF)
module for integrating low-level details with high-level semantics, and a
global median enhancement attention (GMEA) module to improve feature diversity
and expressiveness via global attention. Experiments on public datasets SIRST,
NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1k demonstrate that ARFC-WAHNet outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods in both detection accuracy and robustness,
particularly under complex backgrounds. The code is available at

Abstract: In recent years, range-view-based LiDAR point cloud super-resolution
techniques attract significant attention as a low-cost method for generating
higher-resolution point cloud data. However, due to the sparsity and irregular
structure of LiDAR point clouds, the point cloud super-resolution problem
remains a challenging topic, especially for point cloud upsampling under novel
views. In this paper, we propose SRMamba, a novel method for super-resolution
of LiDAR point clouds in sparse scenes, addressing the key challenge of
recovering the 3D spatial structure of point clouds from novel views.
Specifically, we implement projection technique based on Hough Voting and Hole
Compensation strategy to eliminate horizontally linear holes in range image. To
improve the establishment of long-distance dependencies and to focus on
potential geometric features in vertical 3D space, we employ Visual State Space
model and Multi-Directional Scanning mechanism to mitigate the loss of 3D
spatial structural information due to the range image. Additionally, an
asymmetric U-Net network adapts to the input characteristics of LiDARs with
different beam counts, enabling super-resolution reconstruction for multi-beam

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的3D视线估计方法GA3CE，通过学习主体与场景中物体的空间关系来估计3D视线方向，适用于无约束场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在无约束场景中（如主体距离较远或背对镜头时）从2D观测估计3D视线方向的挑战。

Method: 使用3D姿势和物体位置表示主体和场景，提出GA3CE方法，结合D$^3$位置编码来捕捉空间关系。

Result: 在单帧设置下，比基线方法减少了13%-37%的平均角度误差。

Conclusion: GA3CE方法显著提升了3D视线估计的准确性，尤其在复杂场景中表现优异。

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze estimation approach that learns spatial
relationships between the subject and objects in the scene, and outputs 3D gaze
direction. Our method targets unconstrained settings, including cases where
close-up views of the subject's eyes are unavailable, such as when the subject
is distant or facing away. Previous approaches typically rely on either 2D
appearance alone or incorporate limited spatial cues using depth maps in the
non-learnable post-processing step. Estimating 3D gaze direction from 2D
observations in these scenarios is challenging; variations in subject pose,
scene layout, and gaze direction, combined with differing camera poses, yield
diverse 2D appearances and 3D gaze directions even when targeting the same 3D
scene. To address this issue, we propose GA3CE: Gaze-Aware 3D Context Encoding.
Our method represents subject and scene using 3D poses and object positions,
treating them as 3D context to learn spatial relationships in 3D space.
Inspired by human vision, we align this context in an egocentric space,
significantly reducing spatial complexity. Furthermore, we propose D$^3$
(direction-distance-decomposed) positional encoding to better capture the
spatial relationship between 3D context and gaze direction in direction and
distance space. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements, reducing mean
angle error by 13%-37% compared to leading baselines on benchmark datasets in
single-frame settings.

Conclusion: GaussianFormer3D为多模态语义占用预测提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is critical for achieving safe and reliable
autonomous driving. Compared to camera-only perception systems, multi-modal
pipelines, especially LiDAR-camera fusion methods, can produce more accurate
and detailed predictions. Although most existing works utilize a dense
grid-based representation, in which the entire 3D space is uniformly divided
into discrete voxels, the emergence of 3D Gaussians provides a compact and
continuous object-centric representation. In this work, we propose a
multi-modal Gaussian-based semantic occupancy prediction framework utilizing 3D
deformable attention, named as GaussianFormer3D. We introduce a
voxel-to-Gaussian initialization strategy to provide 3D Gaussians with geometry
priors from LiDAR data, and design a LiDAR-guided 3D deformable attention
mechanism for refining 3D Gaussians with LiDAR-camera fusion features in a
lifted 3D space. We conducted extensive experiments on both on-road and
off-road datasets, demonstrating that our GaussianFormer3D achieves high
prediction accuracy that is comparable to state-of-the-art multi-modal
fusion-based methods with reduced memory consumption and improved efficiency.

Conclusion: SynRailObs在铁路安全应用中具有显著潜力，可推动障碍物检测技术的发展。

Abstract: Detecting potential obstacles in railway environments is critical for
preventing serious accidents. Identifying a broad range of obstacle categories
under complex conditions requires large-scale datasets with precisely
annotated, high-quality images. However, existing publicly available datasets
fail to meet these requirements, thereby hindering progress in railway safety
research. To address this gap, we introduce SynRailObs, a high-fidelity
synthetic dataset designed to represent a diverse range of weather conditions
and geographical features. Furthermore, diffusion models are employed to
generate rare and difficult-to-capture obstacles that are typically challenging
to obtain in real-world scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of SynRailObs,
we perform experiments in real-world railway environments, testing on both
ballasted and ballastless tracks across various weather conditions. The results
demonstrate that SynRailObs holds substantial potential for advancing obstacle
detection in railway safety applications. Models trained on this dataset show
consistent performance across different distances and environmental conditions.
Moreover, the model trained on SynRailObs exhibits zero-shot capabilities,
which are essential for applications in security-sensitive domains. The data is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目RGB图像中未见物体6D姿态估计的挑战，传统方法依赖预定义物体模型，而RefPose通过参考图像和几何对应动态适应新物体。

Method: RefPose分为初始姿态预测和细化阶段，利用物体模板渲染参考图像建立几何对应，并通过渲染-比较方法迭代优化姿态，引入相关性体积引导的注意力机制。

Result: 在BOP基准数据集上取得最先进结果，同时保持高效运行时间。

Conclusion: RefPose通过动态适应新物体形状，显著提升了未见物体的6D姿态估计性能。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of unseen objects from monocular RGB images remains a
challenging problem, especially due to the lack of prior object-specific
knowledge. To tackle this issue, we propose RefPose, an innovative approach to
object pose estimation that leverages a reference image and geometric
correspondence as guidance. RefPose first predicts an initial pose by using
object templates to render the reference image and establish the geometric
correspondence needed for the refinement stage. During the refinement stage,
RefPose estimates the geometric correspondence of the query based on the
generated references and iteratively refines the pose through a
render-and-compare approach. To enhance this estimation, we introduce a
correlation volume-guided attention mechanism that effectively captures
correlations between the query and reference images. Unlike traditional methods
that depend on pre-defined object models, RefPose dynamically adapts to new
object shapes by leveraging a reference image and geometric correspondence.
This results in robust performance across previously unseen objects. Extensive
evaluation on the BOP benchmark datasets shows that RefPose achieves
state-of-the-art results while maintaining a competitive runtime.

Abstract: Reliable three-dimensional human pose estimation is becoming increasingly
important for real-world applications, yet much of prior work has focused
solely on the performance within a single dataset. In practice, however,
systems must adapt to diverse viewpoints, environments, and camera setups --
conditions that differ significantly from those encountered during training,
which is often the case in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges,
we present a standardized testing environment in which each method is evaluated
on a variety of datasets, ensuring consistent and fair cross-dataset
comparisons -- allowing for the analysis of methods on previously unseen data.
Therefore, we propose PoseBench3D, a unified framework designed to
systematically re-evaluate prior and future models across four of the most
widely used datasets for human pose estimation -- with the framework able to
support novel and future datasets as the field progresses. Through a unified
interface, our framework provides datasets in a pre-configured yet easily
modifiable format, ensuring compatibility with diverse model architectures. We
re-evaluated the work of 18 methods, either trained or gathered from existing
literature, and reported results using both Mean Per Joint Position Error
(MPJPE) and Procrustes Aligned Mean Per Joint Position Error (PA-MPJPE)
metrics, yielding more than 100 novel cross-dataset evaluation results.
Additionally, we analyze performance differences resulting from various
pre-processing techniques and dataset preparation parameters -- offering

Conclusion: CulTi数据集和LACLIP策略填补了中国文化遗产跨模态检索的空白，为相关研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: China has a long and rich history, encompassing a vast cultural heritage that
includes diverse multimodal information, such as silk patterns, Dunhuang
murals, and their associated historical narratives. Cross-modal retrieval plays
a pivotal role in understanding and interpreting Chinese cultural heritage by
bridging visual and textual modalities to enable accurate text-to-image and
image-to-text retrieval. However, despite the growing interest in multimodal
research, there is a lack of specialized datasets dedicated to Chinese cultural
heritage, limiting the development and evaluation of cross-modal learning
models in this domain. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal dataset
named CulTi, which contains 5,726 image-text pairs extracted from two series of
professional documents, respectively related to ancient Chinese silk and
Dunhuang murals. Compared to existing general-domain multimodal datasets, CulTi
presents a challenge for cross-modal retrieval: the difficulty of local
alignment between intricate decorative motifs and specialized textual
descriptions. To address this challenge, we propose LACLIP, a training-free
local alignment strategy built upon a fine-tuned Chinese-CLIP. LACLIP enhances
the alignment of global textual descriptions with local visual regions by
computing weighted similarity scores during inference. Experimental results on
CulTi demonstrate that LACLIP significantly outperforms existing models in
cross-modal retrieval, particularly in handling fine-grained semantic
associations within Chinese cultural heritage.

Result: 融合光学和SAR数据使mAP提升5.7%，在复杂环境中效果尤为显著。

Conclusion: M4-SAR和E2E-OSDet为多源融合目标检测提供了标准化数据和基线方法。

Abstract: Single-source remote sensing object detection using optical or SAR images
struggles in complex environments. Optical images offer rich textural details
but are often affected by low-light, cloud-obscured, or low-resolution
conditions, reducing the detection performance. SAR images are robust to
weather, but suffer from speckle noise and limited semantic expressiveness.
Optical and SAR images provide complementary advantages, and fusing them can
significantly improve the detection accuracy. However, progress in this field
is hindered by the lack of large-scale, standardized datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose the first comprehensive dataset for optical-SAR fusion
object detection, named Multi-resolution, Multi-polarization, Multi-scene,
Multi-source SAR dataset (M4-SAR). It contains 112,184 precisely aligned image
pairs and nearly one million labeled instances with arbitrary orientations,
spanning six key categories. To enable standardized evaluation, we develop a
unified benchmarking toolkit that integrates six state-of-the-art multi-source
fusion methods. Furthermore, we propose E2E-OSDet, a novel end-to-end
multi-source fusion detection framework that mitigates cross-domain
discrepancies and establishes a robust baseline for future studies. Extensive
experiments on M4-SAR demonstrate that fusing optical and SAR data can improve
$mAP$ by 5.7\% over single-source inputs, with particularly significant gains
in complex environments. The dataset and code are publicly available at

Abstract: The practical deployment of Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) systems is
hindered by their sensitivity to real-world imaging variations, particularly
the complex interplay between viewpoint and illumination which drastically
alters defect visibility. Current benchmarks largely overlook this critical
challenge. We introduce Multi-View Multi-Illumination Anomaly Detection (M2AD),
a new large-scale benchmark comprising 119,880 high-resolution images designed
explicitly to probe VAD robustness under such interacting conditions. By
systematically capturing 999 specimens across 10 categories using 12
synchronized views and 10 illumination settings (120 configurations total),
M2AD enables rigorous evaluation. We establish two evaluation protocols:
M2AD-Synergy tests the ability to fuse information across diverse
configurations, and M2AD-Invariant measures single-image robustness against
realistic view-illumination effects. Our extensive benchmarking shows that
state-of-the-art VAD methods struggle significantly on M2AD, demonstrating the
profound challenge posed by view-illumination interplay. This benchmark serves
as an essential tool for developing and validating VAD methods capable of
overcoming real-world complexities. Our full dataset and test suite will be

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation has attracted significant
attention due to its potential to reduce manual annotation costs. The mean
teacher (MT) strategy, commonly understood as introducing smoothed, temporally
lagged consistency regularization, has demonstrated strong performance across
various tasks in this field. In this work, we reinterpret the MT strategy on
supervised data as a form of self-paced learning, regulated by the output
agreement between the temporally lagged teacher model and the ground truth
labels. This idea is further extended to incorporate agreement between a
temporally lagged model and a cross-architectural model, which offers greater
flexibility in regulating the learning pace and enables application to
unlabeled data. Specifically, we propose dual teacher-student learning (DTSL),
a framework that introduces two groups of teacher-student models with different
architectures. The output agreement between the cross-group teacher and student
models is used as pseudo-labels, generated via a Jensen-Shannon
divergence-based consensus label generator (CLG). Extensive experiments on
popular datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
existing state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies further validate the
effectiveness of the proposed modules.

Abstract: Street view data is increasingly being used in computer vision applications
in recent years. Machine learning datasets are collected for these applications
using simple sampling techniques. These datasets are assumed to be a systematic
representation of cities, especially when densely sampled. Prior works however,
show that there are clear gaps in coverage, with certain cities or regions
being covered poorly or not at all. Here we demonstrate that a cities'
idiosyncracies, such as city layout, may lead to biases in street view data for
28 cities across the globe, even when they are densely covered. We
quantitatively uncover biases in the distribution of coverage of street view
data and propose a method for evaluation of such distributions to get better
insight in idiosyncracies in a cities' coverage. In addition, we perform a case
study of Amsterdam with semi-structured interviews, showing how idiosyncracies
of the collection process impact representation of cities and regions and
allowing us to address biases at their source.

Visual Mamba, we introduce a strip-based scanning scheme to effectively reduce
artifacts from global unidirectional scanning. Additionally, HSRMamba uses
wavelet decomposition to alleviate modal conflicts between high-frequency
spatial features and low-frequency spectral features, further improving
super-resolution performance. Extensive experiments show that HSRMamba not only
excels in reducing computational load and model size but also outperforms
existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: PL-DC框架有效解决了伪标签噪声问题，为半监督实例分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Instance Segmentation (SSIS) involves classifying and
grouping image pixels into distinct object instances using limited labeled
data. This learning paradigm usually faces a significant challenge of unstable
performance caused by noisy pseudo-labels of instance categories and pixel
masks. We find that the prevalent practice of filtering instance pseudo-labels
assessing both class and mask quality with a single score threshold, frequently
leads to compromises in the trade-off between the qualities of class and mask
labels. In this paper, we introduce a novel Pseudo-Label Quality Decoupling and
Correction (PL-DC) framework for SSIS to tackle the above challenges. Firstly,
at the instance level, a decoupled dual-threshold filtering mechanism is
designed to decouple class and mask quality estimations for instance-level
pseudo-labels, thereby independently controlling pixel classifying and grouping
qualities. Secondly, at the category level, we introduce a dynamic instance
category correction module to dynamically correct the pseudo-labels of instance
categories, effectively alleviating category confusion. Lastly, we introduce a
pixel-level mask uncertainty-aware mechanism at the pixel level to re-weight
the mask loss for different pixels, thereby reducing the impact of noise
introduced by pixel-level mask pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on the COCO
and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that the proposed PL-DC achieves
significant performance improvements, setting new state-of-the-art results for
SSIS. Notably, our PL-DC shows substantial gains even with minimal labeled
data, achieving an improvement of +11.6 mAP with just 1% COCO labeled data and
+15.5 mAP with 5% Cityscapes labeled data. The code will be public.

Abstract: In incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC), missing data induce prototype
shifts within views and semantic inconsistencies across views. A feasible
solution is to explore cross-view consistency in paired complete observations,
further imputing and aligning the similarity relationships inherently shared
across views. Nevertheless, existing methods are constrained by two-tiered
limitations: (1) Neither instance- nor cluster-level consistency learning
construct a semantic space shared across views to learn consensus semantics.
The former enforces cross-view instances alignment, and wrongly regards
unpaired observations with semantic consistency as negative pairs; the latter
focuses on cross-view cluster counterparts while coarsely handling fine-grained
intra-cluster relationships within views. (2) Excessive reliance on consistency
results in unreliable imputation and alignment without incorporating
view-specific cluster information. Thus, we propose an IMVC framework,
imputation- and alignment-free for consensus semantics learning (FreeCSL). To
bridge semantic gaps across all observations, we learn consensus prototypes
from available data to discover a shared space, where semantically similar
observations are pulled closer for consensus semantics learning. To capture
semantic relationships within specific views, we design a heuristic graph
clustering based on modularity to recover cluster structure with intra-cluster
compactness and inter-cluster separation for cluster semantics enhancement.
Extensive experiments demonstrate, compared to state-of-the-art competitors,
FreeCSL achieves more confident and robust assignments on IMVC task.

Conclusion: 该方法在事件相机物体识别中表现出色，显著提升了噪声去除和识别性能。

Abstract: Event cameras, which capture brightness changes with high temporal
resolution, inherently generate a significant amount of redundant and noisy
data beyond essential object structures. The primary challenge in event-based
object recognition lies in effectively removing this noise without losing
critical spatial-temporal information. To address this, we propose an Adaptive
Graph-based Noisy Data Removal framework for Event-based Object Recognition.
Specifically, our approach integrates adaptive event segmentation based on
normalized density analysis, a multifactorial edge-weighting mechanism, and
adaptive graph-based denoising strategies. These innovations significantly
enhance the integration of spatiotemporal information, effectively filtering
noise while preserving critical structural features for robust recognition.
Experimental evaluations on four challenging datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves superior recognition accuracies of 83.77%, 76.79%, 99.30%, and
96.89%, surpassing existing graph-based methods by up to 8.79%, and improving
noise reduction performance by up to 19.57%, with an additional accuracy gain
of 6.26% compared to traditional Euclidean-based techniques.

Abstract: Mobile robots are reaching unprecedented speeds, with platforms like Unitree
B2, and Fraunhofer O3dyn achieving maximum speeds between 5 and 10 m/s.
However, effectively utilizing such speeds remains a challenge due to the
limitations of RGB cameras, which suffer from motion blur and fail to provide
real-time responsiveness. Event cameras, with their asynchronous operation, and
low-latency sensing, offer a promising alternative for high-speed robotic
perception. In this work, we introduce MTevent, a dataset designed for 6D pose
estimation and moving object detection in highly dynamic environments with
large detection distances. Our setup consists of a stereo-event camera and an
RGB camera, capturing 75 scenes, each on average 16 seconds, and featuring 16
unique objects under challenging conditions such as extreme viewing angles,
varying lighting, and occlusions. MTevent is the first dataset to combine
high-speed motion, long-range perception, and real-world object interactions,
making it a valuable resource for advancing event-based vision in robotics. To
establish a baseline, we evaluate the task of 6D pose estimation using NVIDIA's
FoundationPose on RGB images, achieving an Average Recall of 0.22 with
ground-truth masks, highlighting the limitations of RGB-based approaches in
such dynamic settings. With MTevent, we provide a novel resource to improve
perception models and foster further research in high-speed robotic vision. The

Abstract: This paper introduces MutualNeRF, a framework enhancing Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) performance under limited samples using Mutual Information Theory. While
NeRF excels in 3D scene synthesis, challenges arise with limited data and
existing methods that aim to introduce prior knowledge lack theoretical support
in a unified framework. We introduce a simple but theoretically robust concept,
Mutual Information, as a metric to uniformly measure the correlation between
images, considering both macro (semantic) and micro (pixel) levels.
  For sparse view sampling, we strategically select additional viewpoints
containing more non-overlapping scene information by minimizing mutual
information without knowing ground truth images beforehand. Our framework
employs a greedy algorithm, offering a near-optimal solution.
  For few-shot view synthesis, we maximize the mutual information between
inferred images and ground truth, expecting inferred images to gain more
relevant information from known images. This is achieved by incorporating
efficient, plug-and-play regularization terms.
  Experiments under limited samples show consistent improvement over
state-of-the-art baselines in different settings, affirming the efficacy of our
framework.

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了分割成本，同时保持了高解剖学保真度。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate multi-organ segmentation from abdominal CT volumes is
a fundamental challenge in medical image analysis. Existing 3D segmentation
approaches are computationally and memory intensive, often processing entire
volumes that contain many anatomically irrelevant slices. Meanwhile, 2D methods
suffer from class imbalance and lack cross-view contextual awareness. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel, anatomically-aware slice
selector pipeline that reduces input volume prior to segmentation. Our unified
framework introduces a vision-language model (VLM) for cross-view organ
presence detection using fused tri-slice (2.5D) representations from axial,
sagittal, and coronal planes. Our proposed model acts as an "expert" in
anatomical localization, reasoning over multi-view representations to
selectively retain slices with high structural relevance. This enables
spatially consistent filtering across orientations while preserving contextual
cues. More importantly, since standard segmentation metrics such as Dice or IoU
fail to measure the spatial precision of such slice selection, we introduce a
novel metric, Slice Localization Concordance (SLC), which jointly captures
anatomical coverage and spatial alignment with organ-centric reference slices.
Unlike segmentation-specific metrics, SLC provides a model-agnostic evaluation
of localization fidelity. Our model offers substantial improvement gains
against several baselines across all organs, demonstrating both accurate and
reliable organ-focused slice filtering. These results show that our method
enables efficient and spatially consistent organ filtering, thereby
significantly reducing downstream segmentation cost while maintaining high
anatomical fidelity.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a promising technique that characterizes the
spatial gene profiling patterns within the tissue context. Comprehensive ST
analysis depends on consecutive slices for 3D spatial insights, whereas the
missing intermediate tissue sections and high costs limit the practical
feasibility of generating multi-slice ST. In this paper, we propose C2-STi, the
first attempt for interpolating missing ST slices at arbitrary intermediate
positions between adjacent ST slices. Despite intuitive, effective ST
interpolation presents significant challenges, including 1) limited continuity
across heterogeneous tissue sections, 2) complex intrinsic correlation across
genes, and 3) intricate cellular structures and biological semantics within
each tissue section. To mitigate these challenges, in C2-STi, we design 1) a
distance-aware local structural modulation module to adaptively capture
cross-slice deformations and enhance positional correlations between ST slices,
2) a pyramid gene co-expression correlation module to capture multi-scale
biological associations among genes, and 3) a cross-modal alignment module that
integrates the ST-paired hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images to filter
and align the essential cellular features across ST and H\&E images. Extensive
experiments on the public dataset demonstrate our superiority over
state-of-the-art approaches on both single-slice and multi-slice ST
interpolation. Codes are available at

Abstract: As robots for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) gradually become more
accessible and modular, we believe there is a great opportunity to rethink and
expand the visualization and control paradigms that have characterized surgical
teleoperation since its inception. We conjecture that introducing one or more
additional adjustable viewpoints in the abdominal cavity would not only unlock
novel visualization and collaboration strategies for surgeons but also
substantially boost the robustness of machine perception toward shared
autonomy. Immediate advantages include controlling a second viewpoint and
teleoperating surgical tools from a different perspective, which would allow
collaborating surgeons to adjust their views independently and still maneuver
their robotic instruments intuitively. Furthermore, we believe that capturing
synchronized multi-view 3D measurements of the patient's anatomy would unlock
advanced scene representations. Accurate real-time intraoperative 3D perception
will allow algorithmic assistants to directly control one or more robotic
instruments and/or robotic cameras. Toward these goals, we are building a
synchronized multi-viewpoint, multi-sensor robotic surgery system by
integrating high-performance vision components and upgrading the da Vinci
Research Kit control logic. This short paper reports a functional summary of
our setup and elaborates on its potential impacts in research and future
clinical practice. By fully open-sourcing our system, we will enable the
research community to reproduce our setup, improve it, and develop powerful
algorithms, effectively boosting clinical translation of cutting-edge research.

Abstract: Comprehensive assessment of the various aspects of the brain's microstructure
requires the use of complementary imaging techniques. This includes measuring
the spatial distribution of cell bodies (cytoarchitecture) and nerve fibers
(myeloarchitecture). The gold standard for cytoarchitectonic analysis is light
microscopic imaging of cell-body stained tissue sections. To reveal the 3D
orientations of nerve fibers, 3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) has been
introduced as a reliable technique providing a resolution in the micrometer
range while allowing processing of series of complete brain sections. 3D-PLI
acquisition is label-free and allows subsequent staining of sections after
measurement. By post-staining for cell bodies, a direct link between fiber- and
cytoarchitecture can potentially be established within the same section.
However, inevitable distortions introduced during the staining process make a
nonlinear and cross-modal registration necessary in order to study the detailed
relationships between cells and fibers in the images. In addition, the
complexity of processing histological sections for post-staining only allows
for a limited number of samples. In this work, we take advantage of deep
learning methods for image-to-image translation to generate a virtual staining
of 3D-PLI that is spatially aligned at the cellular level. In a supervised
setting, we build on a unique dataset of brain sections, to which Cresyl violet
staining has been applied after 3D-PLI measurement. To ensure high
correspondence between both modalities, we address the misalignment of training
data using Fourier-based registration methods. In this way, registration can be
efficiently calculated during training for local image patches of target and
predicted staining. We demonstrate that the proposed method enables prediction
of a Cresyl violet staining from 3D-PLI, matching individual cell instances.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning and aerial imaging have transformed

population of Salvin's albatross (Thalassarche salvini) on the Bounty Islands,
New Zealand. Using drone-derived imagery, we evaluate the model's effectiveness
in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, incorporating enhanced inference
techniques and stronger augmentation methods. Our findings indicate that while
applying the model in a zero-shot setting offers a strong baseline, fine-tuning
with annotations from the target domain and stronger image augmentation leads
to marked improvements in detection accuracy. These results highlight the
potential of leveraging pre-trained deep-learning models for species-specific
monitoring in remote and challenging environments.

Abstract: Although the use of remote sensing technologies for monitoring forested
environments has gained increasing attention, publicly available point cloud
datasets remain scarce due to the high costs, sensor requirements, and
time-intensive nature of their acquisition. Moreover, as far as we are aware,
there are no public annotated datasets generated through Structure From Motion
(SfM) algorithms applied to imagery, which may be due to the lack of SfM
algorithms that can map semantic segmentation information into an accurate
point cloud, especially in a challenging environment like forests.
  In this work, we present a novel pipeline for generating semantically
segmented point clouds of forest environments. Using a custom-built forest
simulator, we generate realistic RGB images of diverse forest scenes along with
their corresponding semantic segmentation masks. These labeled images are then
processed using modified open-source SfM software capable of preserving
semantic information during 3D reconstruction. The resulting point clouds
provide both geometric and semantic detail, offering a valuable resource for
training and evaluating deep learning models aimed at segmenting real forest
point clouds obtained via SfM.

Abstract: Thermal Infrared (TIR) technology involves the use of sensors to detect and

this study, we present a novel and efficient thermal infrared object detection
framework, known as CRT-YOLO, that is based on centralized feature regulation,
enabling the establishment of global-range interaction on TIR information. Our
proposed model integrates efficient multi-scale attention (EMA) modules, which
adeptly capture long-range dependencies while incurring minimal computational
overhead. Additionally, it leverages the Centralized Feature Pyramid (CFP)
network, which offers global regulation of TIR features. Extensive experiments
conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CRT-YOLO model
significantly outperforms conventional methods for TIR image object detection.
Furthermore, the ablation study provides compelling evidence of the
effectiveness of our proposed modules, reinforcing the potential impact of our
approach on advancing the field of thermal infrared object detection.

native images, which are then projected across candidate depth hypotheses using
plane sweeping. Our method geometric preconditioning effectively adapts
epipolar-based features for enhanced multi-view reconstruction, without
requiring the laborious multi-view training dataset creation. By aggregating
learned similarities, we construct and regularize the cost volume, leading to
improved multi-view surface reconstruction over traditional dense matching
approaches. MV-DeepSimNets demonstrates superior performance against leading
similarity learning networks and end-to-end regression models, especially in
terms of generalization capabilities across both aerial and satellite imagery

Abstract: We present TartanGround, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset to advance the
perception and autonomy of ground robots operating in diverse environments.
This dataset, collected in various photorealistic simulation environments
includes multiple RGB stereo cameras for 360-degree coverage, along with depth,
optical flow, stereo disparity, LiDAR point clouds, ground truth poses,
semantic segmented images, and occupancy maps with semantic labels. Data is
collected using an integrated automatic pipeline, which generates trajectories
mimicking the motion patterns of various ground robot platforms, including
wheeled and legged robots. We collect 910 trajectories across 70 environments,
resulting in 1.5 million samples. Evaluations on occupancy prediction and SLAM
tasks reveal that state-of-the-art methods trained on existing datasets
struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. TartanGround can serve as a
testbed for training and evaluation of a broad range of learning-based tasks,
including occupancy prediction, SLAM, neural scene representation,
perception-based navigation, and more, enabling advancements in robotic
perception and autonomy towards achieving robust models generalizable to more
diverse scenarios. The dataset and codebase for data collection will be made
publicly available upon acceptance. Webpage: https://tartanair.org/tartanground

Abstract: Textured mesh quality assessment (TMQA) is critical for various 3D mesh
applications. However, existing TMQA methods often struggle to provide accurate
and robust evaluations. Motivated by the effectiveness of fields in
representing both 3D geometry and color information, we propose a novel
point-based TMQA method called field mesh quality metric (FMQM). FMQM utilizes
signed distance fields and a newly proposed color field named nearest surface
point color field to realize effective mesh feature description. Four features
related to visual perception are extracted from the geometry and color fields:
geometry similarity, geometry gradient similarity, space color distribution
similarity, and space color gradient similarity. Experimental results on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FMQM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
TMQA metrics. Furthermore, FMQM exhibits low computational complexity, making
it a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications in 3D
graphics and visualization. Our code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Determining the shelf life quality of pineapples using non-destructive
methods is a crucial step to reduce waste and increase income. In this paper, a
multimodal and multiview classification model was constructed to classify
pineapples into four quality levels based on audio and visual characteristics.
For research purposes, we compiled and released the PQC500 dataset consisting
of 500 pineapples with two modalities: one was tapping pineapples to record
sounds by multiple microphones and the other was taking pictures by multiple
cameras at different locations, providing multimodal and multi-view audiovisual
features. We modified the contrastive audiovisual masked autoencoder to train
the cross-modal-based classification model by abundant combinations of audio
and visual pairs. In addition, we proposed to sample a compact size of training
data for efficient computation. The experiments were evaluated under various
data and model configurations, and the results demonstrated that the proposed
cross-modal model trained using audio-major sampling can yield 84% accuracy,
outperforming the unimodal models of only audio and only visual by 6% and 18%,

Abstract: Hands are essential to human interaction, and understanding contact between
hands and the world can promote comprehensive understanding of their function.
Recently, there have been growing number of hand interaction datasets that
cover interaction with object, other hand, scene, and body. Despite the
significance of the task and increasing high-quality data, how to effectively
learn dense hand contact estimation remains largely underexplored. There are
two major challenges for learning dense hand contact estimation. First, there
exists class imbalance issue from hand contact datasets where majority of
samples are not in contact. Second, hand contact datasets contain spatial
imbalance issue with most of hand contact exhibited in finger tips, resulting
in challenges for generalization towards contacts in other hand regions. To
tackle these issues, we present a framework that learns dense HAnd COntact
estimation (HACO) from imbalanced data. To resolve the class imbalance issue,
we introduce balanced contact sampling, which builds and samples from multiple
sampling groups that fairly represent diverse contact statistics for both
contact and non-contact samples. Moreover, to address the spatial imbalance
issue, we propose vertex-level class-balanced (VCB) loss, which incorporates
spatially varying contact distribution by separately reweighting loss
contribution of each vertex based on its contact frequency across dataset. As a
result, we effectively learn to predict dense hand contact estimation with
large-scale hand contact data without suffering from class and spatial
imbalance issue. The codes will be released.

Result: ROIsGAN在DG、CA1和CA3亚区的分割任务中表现优于传统模型，Dice得分提升1-10%，IoU提升达11%。

Conclusion: 该研究为神经科学中的自动化组织图像分析提供了基础数据集和方法。

Abstract: The hippocampus, a critical brain structure involved in memory processing and
various neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, comprises three key
subregions: the dentate gyrus (DG), Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1), and Cornu Ammonis 3
(CA3). Accurate segmentation of these subregions from histological tissue
images is essential for advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms,
developmental dynamics, and therapeutic interventions. However, no existing
methods address the automated segmentation of hippocampal subregions from
tissue images, particularly from immunohistochemistry (IHC) images. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel set of four comprehensive murine hippocampal IHC
datasets featuring distinct staining modalities: cFos, NeuN, and multiplexed
stains combining cFos, NeuN, and either {\Delta}FosB or GAD67, capturing
structural, neuronal activity, and plasticity associated information.
Additionally, we propose ROIsGAN, a region-guided U-Net-based generative
adversarial network tailored for hippocampal subregion segmentation. By
leveraging adversarial learning, ROIsGAN enhances boundary delineation and
structural detail refinement through a novel region-guided discriminator loss
combining Dice and binary cross-entropy loss. Evaluated across DG, CA1, and CA3
subregions, ROIsGAN consistently outperforms conventional segmentation models,
achieving performance gains ranging from 1-10% in Dice score and up to 11% in
Intersection over Union (IoU), particularly under challenging staining
conditions. Our work establishes foundational datasets and methods for
automated hippocampal segmentation, enabling scalable, high-precision analysis
of tissue images in neuroscience research. Our generated datasets, proposed

Abstract: Accurate velocity estimation is critical in mobile robotics, particularly for
driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. Wheel odometry fused with
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data is a widely used method for velocity
estimation; however, it typically requires strong assumptions, such as non-slip
steering, or complex vehicle dynamics models that do not hold under varying
environmental conditions like slippery surfaces. We introduce an approach to
velocity estimation that is decoupled from wheel-to-surface traction
assumptions by leveraging planar kinematics in combination with optical flow
from event cameras pointed perpendicularly at the ground. The asynchronous
micro-second latency and high dynamic range of event cameras make them highly
robust to motion blur, a common challenge in vision-based perception techniques
for autonomous driving. The proposed method is evaluated through in-field
experiments on a 1:10 scale autonomous racing platform and compared to precise
motion capture data, demonstrating not only performance on par with the
state-of-the-art Event-VIO method but also a 38.3 % improvement in lateral
error. Qualitative experiments at highway speeds of up to 32 m/s further
confirm the effectiveness of our approach, indicating significant potential for
real-world deployment.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) enable novel use
cases in domains where responsible action is increasingly important. Yet the
inherent unpredictability of LLMs raises safety concerns about agent
reliability. In this work, we explore agent behaviour in a toy, game-theoretic
environment based on a variation of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. We
introduce a strategy-modification method-independent of both the game and the
prompt-by steering the residual stream with interpretable features extracted
from a sparse autoencoder latent space. Steering with the good-faith
negotiation feature lowers the average defection probability by 28 percentage
points. We also identify feasible steering ranges for several open-source LLM
agents. Finally, we hypothesise that game-theoretic evaluation of LLM agents,
combined with representation-steering alignment, can generalise to real-world
applications on end-user devices and embodied platforms.

Abstract: Current AI benchmarks miss the messy, multi-turn nature of human-AI
collaboration. We present an evaluation framework that decomposes real-world
tasks into interdependent subtasks, letting us track both LLM performance and
users' strategies across a dialogue. Complementing this framework, we develop a
suite of metrics, including a composite usage derived from semantic similarity,
word overlap, and numerical matches; structural coherence; intra-turn
diversity; and a novel measure of the "information frontier" reflecting the
alignment between AI outputs and users' working knowledge. We demonstrate our
methodology in a financial valuation task that mirrors real-world complexity.
Our empirical findings reveal that while greater integration of LLM-generated
content generally enhances output quality, its benefits are moderated by
factors such as response incoherence, excessive subtask diversity, and the
distance of provided information from users' existing knowledge. These results
suggest that proactive dialogue strategies designed to inject novelty may
inadvertently undermine task performance. Our work thus advances a more
holistic evaluation of human-AI collaboration, offering both a robust
methodological framework and actionable insights for developing more effective
AI-augmented work processes.

Abstract: Learning how the world works is central to building AI agents that can adapt
to complex environments. Traditional world models based on deep learning demand
vast amounts of training data, and do not flexibly update their knowledge from
sparse observations. Recent advances in program synthesis using Large Language
Models (LLMs) give an alternate approach which learns world models represented
as source code, supporting strong generalization from little data. To date,
application of program-structured world models remains limited to natural
language and grid-world domains. We introduce a novel program synthesis method
for effectively modeling complex, non-gridworld domains by representing a world
model as an exponentially-weighted product of programmatic experts (PoE-World)
synthesized by LLMs. We show that this approach can learn complex, stochastic
world models from just a few observations. We evaluate the learned world models
by embedding them in a model-based planning agent, demonstrating efficient
performance and generalization to unseen levels on Atari's Pong and Montezuma's
Revenge. We release our code and display the learned world models and videos of

Abstract: Accuracy remains a standard metric for evaluating AI systems, but it offers
limited insight into how models arrive at their solutions. In this work, we
introduce a benchmark based on brainteasers written in long narrative form to
probe more deeply into the types of reasoning strategies that models use.
Brainteasers are well-suited for this goal because they can be solved with
multiple approaches, such as a few-step solution that uses a creative insight
or a longer solution that uses more brute force. We investigate large language
models (LLMs) across multiple layers of reasoning, focusing not only on
correctness but also on the quality and creativity of their solutions. We
investigate many aspects of the reasoning process: (1) semantic parsing of the
brainteasers into precise mathematical competition style formats; (2)
generating solutions from these mathematical forms; (3) self-correcting
solutions based on gold solutions; (4) producing step-by-step sketches of
solutions; and (5) making use of hints. We find that LLMs are in many cases
able to find creative, insightful solutions to brainteasers, suggesting that
they capture some of the capacities needed to solve novel problems in creative
ways. Nonetheless, there also remain situations where they rely on brute force
despite the availability of more efficient, creative solutions, highlighting a
potential direction for improvement in the reasoning abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, scaling test-time compute on Large Language Models (LLM) has
garnered wide attention. However, there has been limited investigation of how
various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we
focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We
systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies
$\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the
sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting
strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple
Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs.
Additionally, we propose a method according to probability theory to quickly
and accurately predict the scaling performance and select the best strategy
under large sampling times without extra resource-intensive inference in
practice. It can serve as the test-time scaling law for majority voting.
Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to
significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can
promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential
of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing
test-time scaling performance.

Abstract: RAG can enhance the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks. Various
RAG paradigms, including vanilla, planning-based, and iterative RAG, are built
upon 2 cores: the retriever, which should robustly select relevant documents
across complex queries, and the generator, which should faithfully synthesize
responses. However, existing retrievers rely heavily on public knowledge and
struggle with queries of varying logical complexity and clue completeness,
while generators frequently face fidelity problems. In this work, we introduce
RAGSynth, a framework that includes a data construction modeling and a
corresponding synthetic data generation implementation, designed to optimize
retriever robustness and generator fidelity. Additionally, we present
SynthBench, a benchmark encompassing 8 domain-specific documents across 4
domains, featuring diverse query complexities, clue completeness, and
fine-grained citation granularity. Leveraging RAGSynth, we generate a
large-scale synthetic dataset, including single and multi-hop. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the synthetic data significantly improves the
robustness of the retrievers and the fidelity of the generators. Additional
evaluations confirm that RAGSynth can also generalize well across different
domains. By integrating the optimized retrievers into various RAG paradigms, we
consistently observe enhanced RAG system performance. We have open-sourced the
implementation on https://github.com/EachSheep/RAGSynth.

high-risk thought on the fly before each action execution. The corrected
thought is then reintroduced to the agent, ensuring safer subsequent decisions
and tool interactions. Importantly, Thought-Aligner modifies only the reasoning
phase without altering the underlying agent framework, making it easy to deploy
and widely applicable to various agent frameworks. To train the Thought-Aligner
model, we construct an instruction dataset across ten representative scenarios
and simulate ReAct execution trajectories, generating 5,000 diverse
instructions and more than 11,400 safe and unsafe thought pairs. The model is
fine-tuned using contrastive learning techniques. Experiments across three
agent safety benchmarks involving 12 different LLMs demonstrate that
Thought-Aligner raises agent behavioral safety from approximately 50% in the
unprotected setting to 90% on average. Additionally, Thought-Aligner maintains
response latency below 100ms with minimal resource usage, demonstrating its
capability for efficient deployment, broad applicability, and timely
responsiveness. This method thus provides a practical dynamic safety solution
for the LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Group Think的新方法，通过单个LLM模拟多个并发推理代理，实现动态协作，降低延迟并提高推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理代理通常以轮流方式交互，牺牲延迟换取质量提升，而Group Think旨在通过并发推理优化这一过程。

Method: Group Think让单个LLM作为多个并发推理代理运行，通过共享部分生成进度实现动态协作。还提出了一种简单通用的修改方法，适用于任何现有LLM。

Result: 实验证明，Group Think在降低推理延迟的同时提高了质量，并有效利用了空闲计算资源。

Conclusion: Group Think为未来LLM实现更高效协作推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the power
of reasoning through self-generated chains of thought. Multiple reasoning
agents can collaborate to raise joint reasoning quality above individual
outcomes. However, such agents typically interact in a turn-based manner,
trading increased latency for improved quality. In this paper, we propose Group
Think--a single LLM that acts as multiple concurrent reasoning agents, or
thinkers. With shared visibility into each other's partial generation progress,
Group Think introduces a new concurrent-reasoning paradigm in which multiple
reasoning trajectories adapt dynamically to one another at the token level. For
example, a reasoning thread may shift its generation mid-sentence upon
detecting that another thread is better positioned to continue. This
fine-grained, token-level collaboration enables Group Think to reduce redundant
reasoning and improve quality while achieving significantly lower latency.
Moreover, its concurrent nature allows for efficient utilization of idle
computational resources, making it especially suitable for edge inference,
where very small batch size often underutilizes local~GPUs. We give a simple
and generalizable modification that enables any existing LLM to perform Group
Think on a local GPU. We also present an evaluation strategy to benchmark
reasoning latency and empirically demonstrate latency improvements using
open-source LLMs that were not explicitly trained for Group Think. We hope this
work paves the way for future LLMs to exhibit more sophisticated and more
efficient collaborative behavior for higher quality generation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过全局XAI方法检测LLM中的偏见，提出了一种文本到序数的映射策略，并引入RuleSHAP算法以改进检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI系统可能传播偏见和错误信息，而现有XAI工具难以处理LLM的非数值特性，因此需要开发更有效的检测方法。

Method: 通过文本到序数的映射策略将非数值输入/输出转换为数值特征，并注入不同复杂度的偏见，使用RuleFit和SHAP等工具检测，最终提出RuleSHAP算法。

Result: RuleFit在检测复杂偏见时表现不佳，SHAP能近似检测但无法生成可操作规则，RuleSHAP显著提升了检测效果（MRR@1平均提升94%）。

Conclusion: RuleSHAP结合了SHAP和RuleFit的优势，能更有效地检测LLM中的非单变量偏见，为XAI工具在LLM中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generative AI systems can help spread information but also misinformation and
biases, potentially undermining the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Explainable AI (XAI) aims to reveal the inner workings of AI systems and expose
misbehaviours or biases. However, current XAI tools, built for simpler models,
struggle to handle the non-numerical nature of large language models (LLMs).
This paper examines the effectiveness of global XAI methods, such as
rule-extraction algorithms and SHAP, in detecting bias in LLMs. To do so, we
first show a text-to-ordinal mapping strategy to convert non-numerical
inputs/outputs into numerical features, enabling these tools to identify (some)
misinformation-related biases in LLM-generated content. Then, we inject
non-linear biases of varying complexity (univariate, conjunctive, and
non-convex) into widespread LLMs like ChatGPT and Llama via system
instructions, using global XAI methods to detect them. This way, we found that
RuleFit struggles with conjunctive and non-convex biases, while SHAP can
approximate conjunctive biases but cannot express them as actionable rules.
Hence, we introduce RuleSHAP, a global rule extraction algorithm combining SHAP
and RuleFit to detect more non-univariate biases, improving injected bias
detection over RuleFit by +94% (MRR@1) on average.

Result: 纯RL训练能同时提升问题解决和PRM能力，但Self-PRM在困难问题上精度低。

Conclusion: PRM可能非必需，纯RL训练能增强推理能力，需进一步优化奖励对齐。

Abstract: The development of reasoning capabilities represents a critical frontier in
large language models (LLMs) research, where reinforcement learning (RL) and
process reward models (PRMs) have emerged as predominant methodological
frameworks. Contrary to conventional wisdom, empirical evidence from
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that pure RL training focused on mathematical
problem-solving can progressively enhance reasoning abilities without PRM
integration, challenging the perceived necessity of process supervision. In
this study, we conduct a systematic investigation of the relationship between
RL training and PRM capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that problem-solving
proficiency and process supervision capabilities represent complementary
dimensions of reasoning that co-evolve synergistically during pure RL training.
In particular, current PRMs underperform simple baselines like majority voting
when applied to state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B. To
address this limitation, we propose Self-PRM, an introspective framework in
which models autonomously evaluate and rerank their generated solutions through
self-reward mechanisms. Although Self-PRM consistently improves the accuracy of
the benchmark (particularly with larger sample sizes), analysis exposes
persistent challenges: The approach exhibits low precision (<10\%) on difficult
problems, frequently misclassifying flawed solutions as valid. These analyses
underscore the need for continued RL scaling to improve reward alignment and
introspective accuracy. Overall, our findings suggest that PRM may not be
essential for enhancing complex reasoning, as pure RL not only improves
problem-solving skills but also inherently fosters robust PRM capabilities. We
hope these findings provide actionable insights for building more reliable and
self-aware complex reasoning models.

Conclusion: SelfBudgeter能根据问题复杂度合理分配预算，提升推理效率。

Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models demonstrate exceptional performance on
various tasks. However, reasoning models inefficiently over-process both
trivial and complex queries, leading to resource waste and prolonged user
latency. To address this challenge, we propose SelfBudgeter - a self-adaptive
controllable reasoning strategy for efficient reasoning. Our approach adopts a
dual-phase training paradigm: first, the model learns to pre-estimate the
reasoning cost based on the difficulty of the query. Then, we introduce
budget-guided GPRO for reinforcement learning, which effectively maintains
accuracy while reducing output length. SelfBudgeter allows users to anticipate
generation time and make informed decisions about continuing or interrupting
the process. Furthermore, our method enables direct manipulation of reasoning
length via pre-filling token budget. Experimental results demonstrate that
SelfBudgeter can rationally allocate budgets according to problem complexity,
achieving up to 74.47% response length compression on the MATH benchmark while
maintaining nearly undiminished accuracy.

Conclusion: IPP框架通过代码生成和迭代优化，显著提升了网格任务的解决效率和可解释性，同时降低了摊销成本。

Abstract: We propose an iterative programmatic planning (IPP) framework for solving
grid-based tasks by synthesizing interpretable agent policies expressed in code
using large language models (LLMs). Instead of relying on traditional search or
reinforcement learning, our approach uses code generation as policy synthesis,
where the LLM outputs executable programs that map environment states to action
sequences. Our proposed architecture incorporates several prompting strategies,
including direct code generation, pseudocode-conditioned refinement, and
curriculum-based prompting, but also includes an iterative refinement mechanism
that updates code based on task performance feedback. We evaluate our approach
using six leading LLMs and two challenging grid-based benchmarks (GRASP and
MiniGrid). Our IPP framework demonstrates improvements over direct code
generation ranging from 10\% to as much as 10x across five of the six models
and establishes a new state-of-the-art result for GRASP. IPP is found to
significantly outperform direct elicitation of a solution from GPT-o3-mini (by
63\% on MiniGrid to 116\% on GRASP), demonstrating the viability of the overall
approach. Computational costs of all code generation approaches are similar.
While code generation has a higher initial prompting cost compared to direct
solution elicitation (\$0.08 per task vs. \$0.002 per instance for
GPT-o3-mini), the code can be reused for any number of instances, making the
amortized cost significantly lower (by 400x on GPT-o3-mini across the complete
GRASP benchmark).

Abstract: To enhance the safety of VLMs, this paper introduces a novel reasoning-based
VLM guard model dubbed GuardReasoner-VL. The core idea is to incentivize the
guard model to deliberatively reason before making moderation decisions via
online RL. First, we construct GuardReasoner-VLTrain, a reasoning corpus with
123K samples and 631K reasoning steps, spanning text, image, and text-image
inputs. Then, based on it, we cold-start our model's reasoning ability via SFT.
In addition, we further enhance reasoning regarding moderation through online
RL. Concretely, to enhance diversity and difficulty of samples, we conduct
rejection sampling followed by data augmentation via the proposed safety-aware
data concatenation. Besides, we use a dynamic clipping parameter to encourage
exploration in early stages and exploitation in later stages. To balance
performance and token efficiency, we design a length-aware safety reward that
integrates accuracy, format, and token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our model. Remarkably, it surpasses the runner-up by 19.27%
F1 score on average. We release data, code, and models (3B/7B) of

suffer from the difficulty of generating meaningful UI interactions. However,
existing LLM-based exploration approaches rely heavily on LLMs to generate

computational resources. We argue that such extensive usage of LLMs is neither
necessary nor effective, since many actions during exploration do not require,
or may even be biased by the abilities of LLMs. Further, based on the insight
that a precise and compact knowledge plays the central role for effective
exploration, we introduce LLM-Explorer, a new exploration agent designed for
efficiency and affordability. LLM-Explorer uses LLMs primarily for maintaining
the knowledge instead of generating actions, and knowledge is used to guide
action generation in a LLM-less manner. Based on a comparison with 5 strong

However, their deployment entails a range of risks and challenges that require
careful evaluation. To date, there has been a lack of comprehensive,
interdisciplinary studies offering a systematic comparison between open-source

respective advantages and drawbacks. This study aims to: i) critically evaluate

development of an Open, Public, and Safe Gen AI framework. As a methodology, we
adopted a combined approach that integrates three methods: literature review,
critical analysis, and comparative analysis. The proposed framework outlines
key dimensions, openness, public governance, and security, as essential pillars
for shaping the future of trustworthy and inclusive Gen AI. Our findings reveal
that open models offer greater transparency, auditability, and flexibility,
enabling independent scrutiny and bias mitigation. In contrast, closed systems
often provide better technical support and ease of implementation, but at the
cost of unequal access, accountability, and ethical oversight. The research

opponents in strategic settings. We present the results of the first controlled
monetarily-incentivised laboratory experiment looking at differences in human
behaviour in a multi-player p-beauty contest against other humans and LLMs. We
use a within-subject design in order to compare behaviour at the individual
level. We show that, in this environment, human subjects choose significantly
lower numbers when playing against LLMs than humans, which is mainly driven by
the increased prevalence of `zero' Nash-equilibrium choices. This shift is
mainly driven by subjects with high strategic reasoning ability. Subjects who
play the zero Nash-equilibrium choice motivate their strategy by appealing to
perceived LLM's reasoning ability and, unexpectedly, propensity towards
cooperation. Our findings provide foundational insights into the multi-player
human-LLM interaction in simultaneous choice games, uncover heterogeneities in
both subjects' behaviour and beliefs about LLM's play when playing against
them, and suggest important implications for mechanism design in mixed

specifically designed for assessing the understanding of traditional Chinese

data, incorporating images from museum artifacts, everyday life scenes, comics,

that utilizes GPT-4o in text-only mode to generate candidate questions,
followed by human curation to ensure data quality and avoid potential data
leakage. The benchmark also avoids language bias by preventing direct
disclosure of cultural concepts within question texts. Experimental evaluations
across a wide range of MLLMs demonstrate that current models still face
significant challenges when reasoning about culturally grounded visual content.
The results highlight the need for further research in developing culturally

Abstract: We argue that Large language models (LLMs) will soon alter the economics of
cyberattacks. Instead of attacking the most commonly used software and
monetizing exploits by targeting the lowest common denominator among victims,
LLMs enable adversaries to launch tailored attacks on a user-by-user basis. On
the exploitation front, instead of human attackers manually searching for one
difficult-to-identify bug in a product with millions of users, LLMs can find
thousands of easy-to-identify bugs in products with thousands of users. And on
the monetization front, instead of generic ransomware that always performs the
same attack (encrypt all your data and request payment to decrypt), an
LLM-driven ransomware attack could tailor the ransom demand based on the
particular content of each exploited device.
  We show that these two attacks (and several others) are imminently practical
using state-of-the-art LLMs. For example, we show that without any human
intervention, an LLM finds highly sensitive personal information in the Enron
email dataset (e.g., an executive having an affair with another employee) that
could be used for blackmail. While some of our attacks are still too expensive
to scale widely today, the incentives to implement these attacks will only
increase as LLMs get cheaper. Thus, we argue that LLMs create a need for new
defense-in-depth approaches.

Abstract: This paper introduces \textsc{InfantAgent-Next}, a generalist agent capable
of interacting with computers in a multimodal manner, encompassing text,
images, audio, and video. Unlike existing approaches that either build
intricate workflows around a single large model or only provide workflow
modularity, our agent integrates tool-based and pure vision agents within a
highly modular architecture, enabling different models to collaboratively solve
decoupled tasks in a step-by-step manner. Our generality is demonstrated by our
ability to evaluate not only pure vision-based real-world benchmarks (i.e.,
OSWorld), but also more general or tool-intensive benchmarks (e.g., GAIA and
SWE-Bench). Specifically, we achieve $\mathbf{7.27\%}$ accuracy on OSWorld,
higher than Claude-Computer-Use. Codes and evaluation scripts are open-sourced

Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) in formal languages remains a formidable
challenge in AI, demanding rigorous logical deduction and navigating vast
search spaces. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
performance, existing stepwise provers often suffer from biased search
guidance, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal proof strategies. This paper
introduces the Multi-Perspective Search Prover (MPS-Prover), a novel stepwise
ATP system designed to overcome these limitations. MPS-Prover incorporates two
key innovations: a highly effective post-training data curation strategy that
prunes approximately 40% of redundant training data without sacrificing
performance, and a multi-perspective tree search mechanism. This search
integrates a learned critic model with strategically designed heuristic rules
to diversify tactic selection, prevent getting trapped in unproductive states,
and enhance search robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
MPS-Prover achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging
benchmarks, including miniF2F and ProofNet, outperforming prior 7B parameter
models. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that MPS-Prover generates
significantly shorter and more diverse proofs compared to existing stepwise and
whole-proof methods, highlighting its efficiency and efficacy. Our work
advances the capabilities of LLM-based formal reasoning and offers a robust
framework and a comprehensive analysis for developing more powerful theorem
provers.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is critical for attaining trust in
the operation of AI systems. A key question of an AI system is ``why was this
decision made this way''. Formal approaches to XAI use a formal model of the AI
system to identify abductive explanations. While abductive explanations may be
applicable to a large number of inputs sharing the same concrete values, more
general explanations may be preferred for numeric inputs. So-called inflated
abductive explanations give intervals for each feature ensuring that any input
whose values fall withing these intervals is still guaranteed to make the same
prediction. Inflated explanations cover a larger portion of the input space,
and hence are deemed more general explanations. But there can be many
(inflated) abductive explanations for an instance. Which is the best? In this
paper, we show how to find a most general abductive explanation for an AI
decision. This explanation covers as much of the input space as possible, while
still being a correct formal explanation of the model's behaviour. Given that
we only want to give a human one explanation for a decision, the most general
explanation gives us the explanation with the broadest applicability, and hence
the one most likely to seem sensible. (The paper has been accepted at IJCAI2025
conference.)

Conclusion: FLM是一种简单有效的方法，利用LLMs的语义理解能力显著改善了状态-对象组合的可行性判断。

Abstract: Humans can easily tell if an attribute (also called state) is realistic,
i.e., feasible, for an object, e.g. fire can be hot, but it cannot be wet. In
Open-World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning, when all possible state-object
combinations are considered as unseen classes, zero-shot predictors tend to
perform poorly. Our work focuses on using external auxiliary knowledge to
determine the feasibility of state-object combinations. Our Feasibility with
Language Model (FLM) is a simple and effective approach that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to better comprehend the semantic relationships between
states and objects. FLM involves querying an LLM about the feasibility of a
given pair and retrieving the output logit for the positive answer. To mitigate
potential misguidance of the LLM given that many of the state-object
compositions are rare or completely infeasible, we observe that the in-context
learning ability of LLMs is essential. We present an extensive study
identifying Vicuna and ChatGPT as best performing, and we demonstrate that our
FLM consistently improves OW-CZSL performance across all three benchmarks.

Abstract: As embodied AI systems become increasingly multi-modal, personalized, and
interactive, they must learn effectively from diverse sensory inputs, adapt
continually to user preferences, and operate safely under resource and privacy
constraints. These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning
models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model
generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable
candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: Foundation Models (FMs)
provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas
Federated Learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed,
privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However,
when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the
complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied
environments. In this vision paper, we introduce Federated Foundation Models
(FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of
multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed nature
of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical
deployment dimensions of FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified
framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness
and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning,
Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and
personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision
actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for
deploying FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs.

Conclusion: LD-Scene提供了细粒度的对抗行为控制，为特定驾驶场景的测试提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and robustness of autonomous driving systems necessitates
a comprehensive evaluation in safety-critical scenarios. However, these
safety-critical scenarios are rare and difficult to collect from real-world
driving data, posing significant challenges to effectively assessing the
performance of autonomous vehicles. Typical existing methods often suffer from
limited controllability and lack user-friendliness, as extensive expert
knowledge is essentially required. To address these challenges, we propose
LD-Scene, a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for user-controllable adversarial scenario
generation through natural language. Our approach comprises an LDM that
captures realistic driving trajectory distributions and an LLM-based guidance
module that translates user queries into adversarial loss functions,
facilitating the generation of scenarios aligned with user queries. The
guidance module integrates an LLM-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) code generator
and an LLM-based code debugger, enhancing the controllability and robustness in
generating guidance functions. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes
dataset demonstrate that LD-Scene achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating realistic, diverse, and effective adversarial scenarios.
Furthermore, our framework provides fine-grained control over adversarial
behaviors, thereby facilitating more effective testing tailored to specific
driving scenarios.

Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal

confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with

observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved

Abstract: Robot task planning decomposes human instructions into executable action
sequences that enable robots to complete a series of complex tasks. Although
recent large language model (LLM)-based task planners achieve amazing
performance, they assume that human instructions are clear and straightforward.
However, real-world users are not experts, and their instructions to robots
often contain significant vagueness. Linguists suggest that such vagueness
frequently arises from referring expressions (REs), whose meanings depend
heavily on dialogue context and environment. This vagueness is even more
prevalent among the elderly and children, who robots should serve more. This
paper studies how such vagueness in REs within human instructions affects
LLM-based robot task planning and how to overcome this issue. To this end, we
propose the first robot task planning benchmark with vague REs (REI-Bench),
where we discover that the vagueness of REs can severely degrade robot planning
performance, leading to success rate drops of up to 77.9%. We also observe that
most failure cases stem from missing objects in planners. To mitigate the REs
issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach: task-oriented context
cognition, which generates clear instructions for robots, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to aware prompt and chains of thought.
This work contributes to the research community of human-robot interaction
(HRI) by making robot task planning more practical, particularly for non-expert
users, e.g., the elderly and children.

Abstract: Planning trips is a cognitively intensive task involving conflicting user
preferences, dynamic external information, and multi-step temporal-spatial
optimization. Traditional platforms often fall short - they provide static
results, lack contextual adaptation, and fail to support real-time interaction
or intent refinement.
  Our approach, Vaiage, addresses these challenges through a graph-structured
multi-agent framework built around large language models (LLMs) that serve as
both goal-conditioned recommenders and sequential planners. LLMs infer user
intent, suggest personalized destinations and activities, and synthesize
itineraries that align with contextual constraints such as budget, timing,
group size, and weather. Through natural language interaction, structured tool
use, and map-based feedback loops, Vaiage enables adaptive, explainable, and
end-to-end travel planning grounded in both symbolic reasoning and
conversational understanding.
  To evaluate Vaiage, we conducted human-in-the-loop experiments using
rubric-based GPT-4 assessments and qualitative feedback. The full system
achieved an average score of 8.5 out of 10, outperforming the no-strategy (7.2)
and no-external-API (6.8) variants, particularly in feasibility. Qualitative
analysis indicated that agent coordination - especially the Strategy and
Information Agents - significantly improved itinerary quality by optimizing
time use and integrating real-time context. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of combining LLM reasoning with symbolic agent coordination in
open-ended, real-world planning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable capabilities across
financial tasks, including financial report summarization, earnings call
transcript analysis, and asset classification. However, their real-world
effectiveness in managing complex fund investment remains inadequately

LLM-driven trading strategies is their reliance on historical back-testing,
inadvertently enabling LLMs to "time travel"-leveraging future information
embedded in their training corpora, thus resulting in possible information
leakage and overly optimistic performance estimates. To address this issue, we
introduce DeepFund, a live fund benchmark tool designed to rigorously evaluate
LLM in real-time market conditions. Utilizing a multi-agent architecture,
DeepFund connects directly with real-time stock market data-specifically data
published after each model pretraining cutoff-to ensure fair and leakage-free
evaluations. Empirical tests on nine flagship LLMs from leading global
institutions across multiple investment dimensions-including ticker-level

Abstract: Generative skill acquisition enables embodied agents to actively learn a

of large decision models. While prior approaches often rely on supervision
signals from generalist agents (e.g., LLMs), their effectiveness in complex 3D
environments remains unclear; exhaustive evaluation incurs substantial
computational costs, significantly hindering the efficiency of skill learning.
Inspired by recent successes in verification models for mathematical reasoning,
we propose VERGSA (Verifying Embodied Reasoning in Generative Skill
Acquisition), a framework that systematically integrates real-time verification
principles into embodied skill learning. VERGSA establishes 1) a seamless
extension from verification of mathematical reasoning into embodied learning by
dynamically incorporating contextually relevant tasks into prompts and defining
success metrics for both subtasks and overall tasks, and 2) an automated,
scalable reward labeling scheme that synthesizes dense reward signals by
iteratively finalizing the contribution of scene configuration and subtask
learning to overall skill acquisition. To the best of our knowledge, this
approach constitutes the first comprehensive training dataset for
verification-driven generative skill acquisition, eliminating arduous manual
reward engineering. Experiments validate the efficacy of our approach: 1) the
exemplar task pool improves the average task success rates by 21%, 2) our
verification model boosts success rates by 24% for novel tasks and 36% for
encountered tasks, and 3) outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge baselines in verification

Abstract: Understanding and recognizing customer intents in AI systems is crucial,
particularly in domains characterized by short utterances and the cold start
problem, where recommender systems must include new products or services
without sufficient real user data. Customer utterances are characterized by
infrequent word co-occurences and high term variability, which poses
significant challenges for traditional methods in specifying distinct user
needs and preparing synthetic queries. To address this, we propose an agentic
LLM framework for topic modeling and synthetic query generation, which
accelerates the discovery and recognition of customer intents. We first apply
hierarchical topic modeling and intent discovery to expand a human-curated
taxonomy from 36 generic user intents to 278 granular intents, demonstrating
the potential of LLMs to significantly enhance topic specificity and diversity.
Next, to support newly discovered intents and address the cold start problem,
we generate synthetic user query data, which augments real utterances and
reduces dependency on human annotation, especially in low-resource settings.
Topic model experiments show substantial improvements in coherence and
relevance after topic expansion, while synthetic data experiments indicate that
in-class few-shot prompting significantly improves the quality and utility of
synthetic queries without compromising diversity. We also show that
LLM-generated intent descriptions and keywords can effectively substitute for
human-curated versions when used as context for synthetic query generation. Our
research underscores the scalability and utility of LLM agents in topic
modeling and highlights the strategic use of synthetic utterances to enhance
dataset variability and coverage for intent recognition. We present a
comprehensive and robust framework for online discovery and recognition of new
customer intents in dynamic domains.

Abstract: Modern neural networks often activate all neurons for every input, leading to
unnecessary computation and inefficiency. We introduce Matrix-Interpolated
Dropout Layer (MID-L), a novel module that dynamically selects and activates
only the most informative neurons by interpolating between two transformation
paths via a learned, input-dependent gating vector. Unlike conventional dropout
or static sparsity methods, MID-L employs a differentiable Top-k masking
strategy, enabling per-input adaptive computation while maintaining end-to-end
differentiability. MID-L is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into
existing architectures. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks, including
MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, UCI Adult, and IMDB, show that MID-L achieves
up to average 55\% reduction in active neurons, 1.7$\times$ FLOPs savings, and
maintains or exceeds baseline accuracy. We further validate the informativeness
and selectivity of the learned neurons via Sliced Mutual Information (SMI) and
observe improved robustness under overfitting and noisy data conditions.
Additionally, MID-L demonstrates favorable inference latency and memory usage
profiles, making it suitable for both research exploration and deployment on
compute-constrained systems. These results position MID-L as a general-purpose,
plug-and-play dynamic computation layer, bridging the gap between dropout
regularization and efficient inference.

Abstract: We discuss the challenges and propose a framework for evaluating engineering
artificial general intelligence (eAGI) agents. We consider eAGI as a
specialization of artificial general intelligence (AGI), deemed capable of
addressing a broad range of problems in the engineering of physical systems and
associated controllers. We exclude software engineering for a tractable scoping
of eAGI and expect dedicated software engineering AI agents to address the
software implementation challenges. Similar to human engineers, eAGI agents
should possess a unique blend of background knowledge (recall and retrieve) of
facts and methods, demonstrate familiarity with tools and processes, exhibit
deep understanding of industrial components and well-known design families, and
be able to engage in creative problem solving (analyze and synthesize),
transferring ideas acquired in one context to another. Given this broad
mandate, evaluating and qualifying the performance of eAGI agents is a
challenge in itself and, arguably, a critical enabler to developing eAGI
agents. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing an extensible
evaluation framework that specializes and grounds Bloom's taxonomy - a
framework for evaluating human learning that has also been recently used for
evaluating LLMs - in an engineering design context. Our proposed framework
advances the state of the art in benchmarking and evaluation of AI agents in
terms of the following: (a) developing a rich taxonomy of evaluation questions
spanning from methodological knowledge to real-world design problems; (b)
motivating a pluggable evaluation framework that can evaluate not only textual
responses but also evaluate structured design artifacts such as CAD models and
SysML models; and (c) outlining an automatable procedure to customize the
evaluation benchmark to different engineering contexts.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have introduced
groundbreaking approaches to innovating next-generation semantic communication,
which prioritizes conveying the meaning of a message rather than merely
transmitting raw data. A fundamental challenge in semantic communication lies
in accurately identifying and extracting the most critical semantic information
while adapting to downstream tasks without degrading performance, particularly
when the objective at the receiver may evolve over time. To enable flexible
adaptation to multiple tasks at the receiver, this work introduces a novel
semantic communication framework, which is capable of jointly capturing
task-specific information to enhance downstream task performance and contextual
information. Through rigorous experiments on popular image datasets and
computer vision tasks, our framework shows promising improvement compared to
existing work, including superior performance in downstream tasks, better
generalizability, ultra-high bandwidth efficiency, and low reconstruction
latency.

Motivation: Alpha世代是首个与AI共同成长的群体，其独特的数字语言可能导致现有安全工具失效，亟需研究如何改进AI系统以保护青少年在线安全。

Method: 评估了GPT-4、Claude、Gemini和Llama 3四种AI模型对Alpha世代语言的检测能力，使用了100条来自游戏平台、社交媒体和视频内容的表达数据集，并结合人类审核员、家长和Alpha世代研究员的反馈。

Result: 研究发现AI模型在理解Alpha世代语言时存在显著缺陷，导致在线安全风险增加。

Conclusion: 需要重新设计适应青少年语言的安全系统，并结合多方视角（AI、人类、青少年）以提升保护效果。

Abstract: This research offers a unique evaluation of how AI systems interpret the
digital language of Generation Alpha (Gen Alpha, born 2010-2024). As the first
cohort raised alongside AI, Gen Alpha faces new forms of online risk due to
immersive digital engagement and a growing mismatch between their evolving
communication and existing safety tools. Their distinct language, shaped by
gaming, memes, and AI-driven trends, often conceals harmful interactions from
both human moderators and automated systems. We assess four leading AI models
(GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama 3) on their ability to detect masked
harassment and manipulation within Gen Alpha discourse. Using a dataset of 100
recent expressions from gaming platforms, social media, and video content, the
study reveals critical comprehension failures with direct implications for
online safety. This work contributes: (1) a first-of-its-kind dataset capturing
Gen Alpha expressions; (2) a framework to improve AI moderation systems for
youth protection; (3) a multi-perspective evaluation including AI systems,
human moderators, and parents, with direct input from Gen Alpha co-researchers;
and (4) an analysis of how linguistic divergence increases youth vulnerability.
Findings highlight the urgent need to redesign safety systems attuned to youth
communication, especially given Gen Alpha reluctance to seek help when adults
fail to understand their digital world. This study combines the insight of a
Gen Alpha researcher with systematic academic analysis to address critical
digital safety challenges.

Motivation: 当前用户模型局限于特定应用，缺乏灵活推理能力。GUM旨在通过多模态观察实现通用用户理解，支持更智能的人机交互。

Abstract: Human-computer interaction has long imagined technology that understands
us-from our preferences and habits, to the timing and purpose of our everyday
actions. Yet current user models remain fragmented, narrowly tailored to
specific apps, and incapable of the flexible reasoning required to fulfill
these visions. This paper presents an architecture for a general user model
(GUM) that learns about you by observing any interaction you have with your
computer. The GUM takes as input any unstructured observation of a user (e.g.,
device screenshots) and constructs confidence-weighted propositions that
capture that user knowledge and preferences. GUMs can infer that a user is
preparing for a wedding they're attending from messages with a friend. Or
recognize that a user is struggling with a collaborator's feedback on a draft
by observing multiple stalled edits and a switch to reading related work. GUMs
introduce an architecture that infers new propositions about a user from
multimodal observations, retrieves related propositions for context, and
continuously revises existing propositions. To illustrate the breadth of
applications that GUMs enable, we demonstrate how they augment chat-based
assistants with context, manage OS notifications to selectively surface
important information, and enable interactive agents that adapt to preferences
across apps. We also instantiate proactive assistants (GUMBOs) that discover
and execute useful suggestions on a user's behalf using their GUM. In our
evaluations, we find that GUMs make calibrated and accurate inferences about
users, and that assistants built on GUMs proactively identify and perform
actions that users wouldn't think to request explicitly. Altogether, GUMs
introduce methods that leverage multimodal models to understand unstructured
context, enabling long-standing visions of HCI and entirely new interactive
systems that anticipate user needs.

Abstract: In the current rapidly changing digital environment, businesses are under
constant stress to ensure that their systems are secured. Security audits help
to maintain a strong security posture by ensuring that policies are in place,
controls are implemented, gaps are identified for cybersecurity risks
mitigation. However, audits are usually manual, requiring much time and costs.
This paper looks at the possibility of developing a framework to leverage Large
Language Models (LLMs) as an autonomous agent to execute part of the security
audit, namely with the field audit. password policy compliance for Windows
operating system. Through the conduct of an exploration experiment of using
GPT-4 with Langchain, the agent executed the audit tasks by accurately flagging
password policy violations and appeared to be more efficient than traditional
manual audits. Despite its potential limitations in operational consistency in
complex and dynamic environment, the framework suggests possibilities to extend
further to real-time threat monitoring and compliance checks.

Conclusion: ATT和Auto-ATT为TTS系统提供了更鲁棒和快速的评估方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
text-to-speech (TTS) systems, enhancing control over speech style, naturalness,
and emotional expression, which brings TTS Systems closer to human-level
performance. Although the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) remains the standard for TTS
System evaluation, it suffers from subjectivity, environmental inconsistencies,
and limited interpretability. Existing evaluation datasets also lack a
multi-dimensional design, often neglecting factors such as speaking styles,
context diversity, and trap utterances, which is particularly evident in
Chinese TTS evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce the Audio
Turing Test (ATT), a multi-dimensional Chinese corpus dataset ATT-Corpus paired
with a simple, Turing-Test-inspired evaluation protocol. Instead of relying on
complex MOS scales or direct model comparisons, ATT asks evaluators to judge
whether a voice sounds human. This simplification reduces rating bias and
improves evaluation robustness. To further support rapid model development, we
also finetune Qwen2-Audio-Instruct with human judgment data as Auto-ATT for
automatic evaluation. Experimental results show that ATT effectively
differentiates models across specific capability dimensions using its
multi-dimensional design. Auto-ATT also demonstrates strong alignment with
human evaluations, confirming its value as a fast and reliable assessment tool.

Abstract: Imagine hearing a dog bark and turning toward the sound only to see a parked
car, while the real, silent dog sits elsewhere. Such sensory conflicts test
perception, yet humans reliably resolve them by prioritizing sound over
misleading visuals. Despite advances in multimodal AI integrating vision and
audio, little is known about how these systems handle cross-modal conflicts or
whether they favor one modality. In this study, we systematically examine
modality bias and conflict resolution in AI sound localization. We assess
leading multimodal models and benchmark them against human performance in
psychophysics experiments across six audiovisual conditions, including
congruent, conflicting, and absent cues. Humans consistently outperform AI,
demonstrating superior resilience to conflicting or missing visuals by relying
on auditory information. In contrast, AI models often default to visual input,
degrading performance to near chance levels. To address this, we finetune a
state-of-the-art model using a stereo audio-image dataset generated via 3D
simulations. Even with limited training data, the refined model surpasses
existing benchmarks. Notably, it also mirrors human-like horizontal
localization bias favoring left-right precision-likely due to the stereo audio
structure reflecting human ear placement. These findings underscore how sensory
input quality and system architecture shape multimodal representation accuracy.

Abstract: The variety of data in data lakes presents significant challenges for data
analytics, as data scientists must simultaneously analyze multi-modal data,
including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities, they still
remain inadequate for multi-modal data analytics in terms of accuracy,
efficiency, and freshness. First, current natural language (NL) or SQL-like
query languages may struggle to precisely and comprehensively capture users'
analytical intent. Second, relying on a single unified LLM to process diverse
data modalities often leads to substantial inference overhead. Third, data
stored in data lakes may be incomplete or outdated, making it essential to
integrate external open-domain knowledge to generate timely and relevant
analytics results.
  In this paper, we envision a new multi-modal data analytics system.
Specifically, we propose a novel architecture built upon the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), an emerging paradigm that enables LLMs to collaborate with
knowledgeable agents. First, we define a semantic operator hierarchy tailored
for querying multi-modal data in data lakes and develop an AI-agent-powered
NL2Operator translator to bridge user intent and analytical execution. Next, we
introduce an MCP-based execution framework, in which each MCP server hosts
specialized foundation models optimized for specific data modalities. This
design enhances both accuracy and efficiency, while supporting high scalability
through modular deployment. Finally, we propose a updating mechanism by
harnessing the deep research and machine unlearning techniques to refresh the
data lakes and LLM knowledges, with the goal of balancing the data freshness
and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping strategic planning, with
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) enabling coordination among
autonomous agents in complex scenarios. However, its practical deployment in
sensitive military contexts is constrained by the lack of explainability, which
is an essential factor for trust, safety, and alignment with human strategies.
This work reviews and assesses current advances in explainability methods for
MARL with a focus on simulated air combat scenarios. We proceed by adapting
various explainability techniques to different aerial combat scenarios to gain
explanatory insights about the model behavior. By linking AI-generated tactics
with human-understandable reasoning, we emphasize the need for transparency to
ensure reliable deployment and meaningful human-machine interaction. By
illuminating the crucial importance of explainability in advancing MARL for
operational defense, our work supports not only strategic planning but also the
training of military personnel with insightful and comprehensible analyses.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to
assess and improve small language models deployable on edge devices, with a
focus on user profiling from multi-session natural language interactions in
smart home environments. At the core of the dataset are structured user
profiles, each defined by a set of routines - context-triggered, repeatable
patterns of behavior that govern how users interact with their home systems.
Using these profiles as input, a large language model (LLM) generates
corresponding interaction sessions that simulate realistic, diverse, and
context-aware dialogues between users and their devices.
  The primary task supported by this dataset is profile reconstruction:
inferring user routines and preferences solely from interactions history. To
assess how well current models can perform this task under realistic
conditions, we benchmarked several state-of-the-art compact language models and
compared their performance against large foundation models. Our results show
that while small models demonstrate some capability in reconstructing profiles,
they still fall significantly short of large models in accurately capturing
user behavior. This performance gap poses a major challenge - particularly
because on-device processing offers critical advantages, such as preserving
user privacy, minimizing latency, and enabling personalized experiences without
reliance on the cloud. By providing a realistic, structured testbed for
developing and evaluating behavioral modeling under these constraints, our
dataset represents a key step toward enabling intelligent, privacy-respecting
AI systems that learn and adapt directly on user-owned devices.

Conclusion: IKGR通过意图知识图谱有效解决了推荐系统中的稀疏性问题，并提供了可解释的推荐。

Abstract: Interaction sparsity is the primary obstacle for recommendation systems.
Sparsity manifests in environments with disproportional cardinality of
groupings of entities, such as users and products in an online marketplace. It
also is found for newly introduced entities, described as the cold-start
problem. Recent efforts to mitigate this sparsity issue shifts the performance
bottleneck to other areas in the computational pipeline. Those that focus on
enriching sparse representations with connectivity data from other external
sources propose methods that are resource demanding and require careful domain
expert aided addition of this newly introduced data. Others that turn to Large
Language Model (LLM) based recommenders will quickly encounter limitations
surrounding data quality and availability. In this work, we propose LLM-based
Intent Knowledge Graph Recommender (IKGR), a novel framework that leverages
retrieval-augmented generation and an encoding approach to construct and
densify a knowledge graph. IKGR learns latent user-item affinities from an
interaction knowledge graph and further densifies it through mutual intent
connectivity. This addresses sparsity issues and allows the model to make
intent-grounded recommendations with an interpretable embedding translation
layer. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate
that IKGR overcomes knowledge gaps and achieves substantial gains over
state-of-the-art baselines on both publicly available and our internal
recommendation datasets.

Conclusion: 结合LLM和推荐系统能有效建模用户角色和行为逻辑，提升推荐系统的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recommender systems filter contents/items valuable to users by inferring
preferences from user features and historical behaviors. Mainstream approaches
follow the learning-to-rank paradigm, which focus on discovering and modeling
item topics (e.g., categories), and capturing user preferences on these topics
based on historical interactions. However, this paradigm often neglects the
modeling of user characteristics and their social roles, which are logical
confounders influencing the correlated interest and user preference transition.
To bridge this gap, we introduce the user role identification task and the
behavioral logic modeling task that aim to explicitly model user roles and
learn the logical relations between item topics and user social roles. We show
that it is possible to explicitly solve these tasks through an efficient
integration framework of Large Language Model (LLM) and recommendation systems,
for which we propose TagCF. On the one hand, the exploitation of the LLM's
world knowledge and logic inference ability produces a virtual logic graph that
reveals dynamic and expressive knowledge of users, augmenting the
recommendation performance. On the other hand, the user role aligns the user
behavioral logic with the observed user feedback, refining our understanding of
user behaviors. Additionally, we also show that the extracted user-item logic
graph is empirically a general knowledge that can benefit a wide range of
recommendation tasks, and conduct experiments on industrial and several public
datasets as verification.

Abstract: Precision agriculture, enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI), offers
promising tools such as remote sensing, intelligent irrigation, fertilization
management, and crop simulation to improve agricultural efficiency and
sustainability. Reinforcement learning (RL), in particular, has outperformed
traditional methods in optimizing yields and resource management. However,
widespread AI adoption is limited by gaps between algorithmic recommendations
and farmers' practical experience, local knowledge, and traditional practices.
To address this, our study emphasizes Human-AI Interaction (HAII), focusing on
transparency, usability, and trust in RL-based farm management. We employ a
well-established trust framework - comprising ability, benevolence, and
integrity - to develop a novel mathematical model quantifying farmers'
confidence in AI-based fertilization strategies. Surveys conducted with farmers
for this research reveal critical misalignments, which are integrated into our
trust model and incorporated into a multi-objective RL framework. Unlike prior
methods, our approach embeds trust directly into policy optimization, ensuring
AI recommendations are technically robust, economically feasible,
context-aware, and socially acceptable. By aligning technical performance with
human-centered trust, this research supports broader AI adoption in

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove the information of specific training
data from a trained model, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and
user requests. While one line of existing MU methods relies on linear parameter
updates via task arithmetic, they suffer from weight entanglement. In this
work, we propose a novel MU framework called Mode Connectivity Unlearning (MCU)
that leverages mode connectivity to find an unlearning pathway in a nonlinear
manner. To further enhance performance and efficiency, we introduce a parameter
mask strategy that not only improves unlearning effectiveness but also reduces
computational overhead. Moreover, we propose an adaptive adjustment strategy
for our unlearning penalty coefficient to adaptively balance forgetting quality
and predictive performance during training, eliminating the need for empirical
hyperparameter tuning. Unlike traditional MU methods that identify only a
single unlearning model, MCU uncovers a spectrum of unlearning models along the
pathway. Overall, MCU serves as a plug-and-play framework that seamlessly
integrates with any existing MU methods, consistently improving unlearning
efficacy. Extensive experiments on the image classification task demonstrate
that MCU achieves superior performance.

exploration. A key innovation is the guidance of MCTS exploration by rich,
quantitative feedback from financial backtesting of each candidate factor,
enabling efficient navigation of the vast search space. Furthermore, a frequent
subtree avoidance mechanism is introduced to bolster search efficiency and
alpha factor performance. Experimental results on real-world stock market data
demonstrate that our LLM-based framework outperforms existing methods by mining
alphas with superior predictive accuracy, trading performance, and improved
interpretability, while offering a more efficient solution for formulaic alpha
mining.

Motivation: 现有基准数据集（如Minifab或SMT2020）缺乏真实场景的复杂性，需评估优化方法在不同复杂度下的表现。

Method: 使用强化学习方法（策略梯度和进化策略）优化半导体前端工厂模拟，并分析其扩展性和效率。

Result: 进化策略在复杂性和扩展性上优于策略梯度，对真实数据集提升4%的延迟和1%的吞吐量。

Conclusion: 进化策略在复杂调度问题中表现更优，但计算成本较高。

Abstract: Benchmark datasets are crucial for evaluating approaches to scheduling or
dispatching in the semiconductor industry during the development and deployment
phases. However, commonly used benchmark datasets like the Minifab or SMT2020
lack the complex details and constraints found in real-world scenarios. To
mitigate this shortcoming, we compare open-source simulation models with a real
industry dataset to evaluate how optimization methods scale with different
levels of complexity. Specifically, we focus on Reinforcement Learning methods,
performing optimization based on policy-gradient and Evolution Strategies. Our
research provides insights into the effectiveness of these optimization methods
and their applicability to realistic semiconductor frontend fab simulations. We
show that our proposed Evolution Strategies-based method scales much better
than a comparable policy-gradient-based approach. Moreover, we identify the
selection and combination of relevant bottleneck tools to control by the agent
as crucial for an efficient optimization. For the generalization across
different loading scenarios and stochastic tool failure patterns, we achieve
advantages when utilizing a diverse training dataset. While the overall
approach is computationally expensive, it manages to scale well with the number
of CPU cores used for training. For the real industry dataset, we achieve an
improvement of up to 4% regarding tardiness and up to 1% regarding throughput.
For the less complex open-source models Minifab and SMT2020, we observe
double-digit percentage improvement in tardiness and single digit percentage
improvement in throughput by use of Evolution Strategies.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何通过RL优化机器人充电策略，解决传统方法中需要通过冗长实验评估的问题。

Method: 方法包括扩展SLAPStack仿真框架以支持充电策略，提出新的RL设计，并使用近端策略优化（PPO）代理进行实验。

Result: 结果表明，灵活的RL方法在服务时间上优于启发式策略，但存在收敛时间长和不稳定的问题；而引导式配置则更稳定但泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 结论是RL在充电策略优化中具有潜力，但需权衡灵活性与稳定性。

Abstract: We propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) design to optimize the
charging strategy for autonomous mobile robots in large-scale block stacking
warehouses. RL design involves a wide array of choices that can mostly only be
evaluated through lengthy experimentation. Our study focuses on how different
reward and action space configurations, ranging from flexible setups to more
guided, domain-informed design configurations, affect the agent performance.
Using heuristic charging strategies as a baseline, we demonstrate the
superiority of flexible, RL-based approaches in terms of service times.
Furthermore, our findings highlight a trade-off: While more open-ended designs
are able to discover well-performing strategies on their own, they may require
longer convergence times and are less stable, whereas guided configurations
lead to a more stable learning process but display a more limited
generalization potential. Our contributions are threefold. First, we extend
SLAPStack, an open-source, RL-compatible simulation-framework to accommodate
charging strategies. Second, we introduce a novel RL design for tackling the
charging strategy problem. Finally, we introduce several novel adaptive
baseline heuristics and reproducibly evaluate the design using a Proximal
Policy Optimization agent and varying different design configurations, with a
focus on reward.

Abstract: Striking the appropriate balance between humans and co-creative AI is an open
research question in computational creativity. Co-creativity, a form of hybrid
intelligence where both humans and AI take action proactively, is a process
that leads to shared creative artifacts and ideas. Achieving a balanced dynamic
in co-creativity requires characterizing control and identifying strategies to
distribute control between humans and AI. We define control as the power to
determine, initiate, and direct the process of co-creation. Informed by a
systematic literature review of 172 full-length papers, we introduce MOSAAIC
(Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in
Co-creation), a novel framework for characterizing and balancing control in
co-creation. MOSAAIC identifies three key dimensions of control: autonomy,
initiative, and authority. We supplement our framework with control
optimization strategies in co-creation. To demonstrate MOSAAIC's applicability,
we analyze the distribution of control in six existing co-creative AI case
studies and present the implications of using this framework.

Abstract: Cluttered garments manipulation poses significant challenges due to the
complex, deformable nature of garments and intricate garment relations. Unlike
single-garment manipulation, cluttered scenarios require managing complex
garment entanglements and interactions, while maintaining garment cleanliness
and manipulation stability. To address these demands, we propose to learn
point-level affordance, the dense representation modeling the complex space and
multi-modal manipulation candidates, while being aware of garment geometry,
structure, and inter-object relations. Additionally, as it is difficult to
directly retrieve a garment in some extremely entangled clutters, we introduce
an adaptation module, guided by learned affordance, to reorganize
highly-entangled garments into states plausible for manipulation. Our framework
demonstrates effectiveness over environments featuring diverse garment types
and pile configurations in both simulation and the real world. Project page:

Abstract: As autonomous systems become integral to various industries, effective
strategies for fault handling are essential to ensure reliability and
efficiency. Transfer of Control (ToC), a traditional approach for interrupting
automated processes during faults, is often triggered unnecessarily in
non-critical situations. To address this, we propose a data-driven method that
uses human interaction data to train AI models capable of preemptively
identifying and addressing issues or assisting users in resolution. Using an
interactive tool simulating an industrial vacuum cleaner, we collected data and
developed an LSTM-based model to predict user behavior. Our findings reveal
that even data from non-experts can effectively train models to reduce
unnecessary ToC events, enhancing the system's robustness. This approach

behaviors, complementing sensor data to improve industrial automation and

Abstract: The study by Gohr et.al at CRYPTO 2019 and sunsequent related works have
shown that neural networks can uncover previously unused features, offering
novel insights into cryptanalysis. Motivated by these findings, we employ
neural networks to learn features specifically related to integral properties
and integrate the corresponding insights into optimized search frameworks.
These findings validate the framework of using neural networks for feature
exploration, providing researchers with novel insights that advance established
cryptanalysis methods.
  Neural networks have inspired the development of more precise integral search
models. By comparing the integral distinguishers obtained via neural networks
with those identified by classical methods, we observe that existing automated
search models often fail to find optimal distinguishers. To address this issue,
we develop a meet in the middle search framework that balances model accuracy
and computational efficiency. As a result, we reduce the number of active
plaintext bits required for an 11 rounds integral distinguisher on SKINNY64/64,
and further identify a 12 rounds key dependent integral distinguisher achieving
one additional round over the previous best-known result.
  The integral distinguishers discovered by neural networks enable key recovery
attacks on more rounds. We identify a 7 rounds key independent integral
distinguisher from neural networks with even only one active plaintext cell,
which is based on linear combinations of bits. This distinguisher enables a 15
rounds key recovery attack on SKINNYn/n, improving upon the previous record by
one round. Additionally, we discover an 8 rounds key dependent integral
distinguisher using neural network that further reduces the time complexity of
key recovery attacks against SKINNY.

Conclusion: Phi框架通过模式分层稀疏和算法-硬件协同设计，显著提升了SNN的计算效率和能效。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are gaining attention for their energy
efficiency and biological plausibility, utilizing 0-1 activation sparsity
through spike-driven computation. While existing SNN accelerators exploit this
sparsity to skip zero computations, they often overlook the unique distribution
patterns inherent in binary activations. In this work, we observe that
particular patterns exist in spike activations, which we can utilize to reduce
the substantial computation of SNN models. Based on these findings, we propose
a novel \textbf{pattern-based hierarchical sparsity} framework, termed
\textbf{\textit{Phi}}, to optimize computation.
  \textit{Phi} introduces a two-level sparsity hierarchy: Level 1 exhibits
vector-wise sparsity by representing activations with pre-defined patterns,
allowing for offline pre-computation with weights and significantly reducing
most runtime computation. Level 2 features element-wise sparsity by
complementing the Level 1 matrix, using a highly sparse matrix to further
reduce computation while maintaining accuracy. We present an algorithm-hardware
co-design approach. Algorithmically, we employ a k-means-based pattern
selection method to identify representative patterns and introduce a
pattern-aware fine-tuning technique to enhance Level 2 sparsity.
Architecturally, we design \textbf{\textit{Phi}}, a dedicated hardware
architecture that efficiently processes the two levels of \textit{Phi} sparsity
on the fly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textit{Phi} achieves a
$3.45\times$ speedup and a $4.93\times$ improvement in energy efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art SNN accelerators, showcasing the effectiveness of
our framework in optimizing SNN computation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale offline training have demonstrated the
potential of generalist policy learning for complex robotic tasks. However,
applying these principles to legged locomotion remains a challenge due to
continuous dynamics and the need for real-time adaptation across diverse
terrains and robot morphologies. In this work, we propose GROQLoco, a scalable,
attention-based framework that learns a single generalist locomotion policy
across multiple quadruped robots and terrains, relying solely on offline
datasets. Our approach leverages expert demonstrations from two distinct
locomotion behaviors - stair traversal (non-periodic gaits) and flat terrain
traversal (periodic gaits) - collected across multiple quadruped robots, to
train a generalist model that enables behavior fusion for both behaviors.
Crucially, our framework operates directly on proprioceptive data from all
robots without incorporating any robot-specific encodings. The policy is
directly deployable on an Intel i7 nuc, producing low-latency control outputs
without any test-time optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
strong zero-shot transfer across highly diverse quadruped robots and terrains,
including hardware deployment on the Unitree Go1, a commercially available 12kg
robot. Notably, we evaluate challenging cross-robot training setups where
different locomotion skills are unevenly distributed across robots, yet observe
successful transfer of both flat walking and stair traversal behaviors to all
robots at test time. We also show preliminary walking on Stoch 5, a 70kg
quadruped, on flat and outdoor terrains without requiring any fine tuning.
These results highlight the potential for robust generalist locomotion across
diverse robots and terrains.

Abstract: Garment manipulation is a critical challenge due to the diversity in garment
categories, geometries, and deformations. Despite this, humans can effortlessly
handle garments, thanks to the dexterity of our hands. However, existing
research in the field has struggled to replicate this level of dexterity,
primarily hindered by the lack of realistic simulations of dexterous garment
manipulation. Therefore, we propose DexGarmentLab, the first environment
specifically designed for dexterous (especially bimanual) garment manipulation,
which features large-scale high-quality 3D assets for 15 task scenarios, and
refines simulation techniques tailored for garment modeling to reduce the
sim-to-real gap. Previous data collection typically relies on teleoperation or
training expert reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are labor-intensive
and inefficient. In this paper, we leverage garment structural correspondence
to automatically generate a dataset with diverse trajectories using only a
single expert demonstration, significantly reducing manual intervention.
However, even extensive demonstrations cannot cover the infinite states of
garments, which necessitates the exploration of new algorithms. To improve
generalization across diverse garment shapes and deformations, we propose a
Hierarchical gArment-manipuLation pOlicy (HALO). It first identifies
transferable affordance points to accurately locate the manipulation area, then
generates generalizable trajectories to complete the task. Through extensive
experiments and detailed analysis of our method and baseline, we demonstrate
that HALO consistently outperforms existing methods, successfully generalizing
to previously unseen instances even with significant variations in shape and
deformation where others fail. Our project page is available at:

Abstract: Object rearrangement is a key task for household robots requiring
personalization without explicit instructions, meaningful object placement in
environments occupied with objects, and generalization to unseen objects and
new environments. To facilitate research addressing these challenges, we
introduce PARSEC, an object rearrangement benchmark for learning user
organizational preferences from observed scene context to place objects in a
partially arranged environment. PARSEC is built upon a novel dataset of 110K
rearrangement examples crowdsourced from 72 users, featuring 93 object
categories and 15 environments. We also propose ContextSortLM, an LLM-based
rearrangement model that places objects in partially arranged environments by
adapting to user preferences from prior and current scene context while
accounting for multiple valid placements. We evaluate ContextSortLM and
existing personalized rearrangement approaches on the PARSEC benchmark and
complement these findings with a crowdsourced evaluation of 108 online raters
ranking model predictions based on alignment with user preferences. Our results
indicate that personalized rearrangement models leveraging multiple scene
context sources perform better than models relying on a single context source.
Moreover, ContextSortLM outperforms other models in placing objects to
replicate the target user's arrangement and ranks among the top two in all
three environment categories, as rated by online evaluators. Importantly, our
evaluation highlights challenges associated with modeling environment semantics
across different environment categories and provides recommendations for future

TL;DR: 论文提出Cocos方法，解决条件扩散策略训练中的损失崩溃问题，通过改进条件流匹配中的源分布，提升训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型中表现优异，但训练效率不足，尤其是当生成条件难以区分时，训练目标会退化为建模边际动作分布（损失崩溃）。

Method: 提出Cocos方法，将条件流匹配中的源分布改为依赖条件，通过锚定条件输入的语义提取，增强条件整合并防止损失崩溃。

Result: 实验表明，Cocos在仿真和真实世界基准测试中实现了更快的收敛和更高的成功率，性能媲美大规模预训练VLA模型，但所需梯度步数和参数更少。

Conclusion: Cocos是一种轻量级、易实现且兼容多种策略架构的通用改进方法，显著提升了扩散策略的训练效率。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have emerged as a mainstream paradigm for building
vision-language-action (VLA) models. Although they demonstrate strong robot
control capabilities, their training efficiency remains suboptimal. In this
work, we identify a fundamental challenge in conditional diffusion policy
training: when generative conditions are hard to distinguish, the training
objective degenerates into modeling the marginal action distribution, a
phenomenon we term loss collapse. To overcome this, we propose Cocos, a simple
yet general solution that modifies the source distribution in the conditional
flow matching to be condition-dependent. By anchoring the source distribution
around semantics extracted from condition inputs, Cocos encourages stronger
condition integration and prevents the loss collapse. We provide theoretical
justification and extensive empirical results across simulation and real-world
benchmarks. Our method achieves faster convergence and higher success rates
than existing approaches, matching the performance of large-scale pre-trained
VLAs using significantly fewer gradient steps and parameters. Cocos is
lightweight, easy to implement, and compatible with diverse policy
architectures, offering a general-purpose improvement to diffusion policy
training.

Motivation: 现有反编译器评估方法过于碎片化，主要关注语法正确性，而忽略了语义保真度和分析师可用性等实际需求。

Method: 提出DecompileBench框架，包含真实世界函数提取、运行时感知验证和LLM-as-Judge自动化评估。

Result: 基于LLM的方法在代码可理解性上优于商业工具，尽管功能正确性低52.2%。

Conclusion: LLM方法有望改变人本逆向工程，DecompileBench开源以推动反编译器研究。

Abstract: Decompilers are fundamental tools for critical security tasks, from
vulnerability discovery to malware analysis, yet their evaluation remains
fragmented. Existing approaches primarily focus on syntactic correctness
through synthetic micro-benchmarks or subjective human ratings, failing to
address real-world requirements for semantic fidelity and analyst usability. We
present DecompileBench, the first comprehensive framework that enables
effective evaluation of decompilers in reverse engineering workflows through
three key components: \textit{real-world function extraction} (comprising
23,400 functions from 130 real-world programs), \textit{runtime-aware
validation}, and \textit{automated human-centric assessment} using LLM-as-Judge
to quantify the effectiveness of decompilers in reverse engineering workflows.
Through a systematic comparison between six industrial-strength decompilers and
six recent LLM-powered approaches, we demonstrate that LLM-based methods
surpass commercial tools in code understandability despite 52.2% lower
functionality correctness. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based
approaches to transform human-centric reverse engineering. We open source
\href{https://github.com/Jennieett/DecompileBench}{DecompileBench} to provide a
framework to advance research on decompilers and assist security experts in
making informed tool selections based on their specific requirements.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is gaining momentum in the

some of the problems of GOFAI. Moreover, we review and critically discuss the
possibility of cross-embodiment learning (Padalkar et al. 2024). We identify
fundamental roadblocks and propose directions on how to make progress.

Abstract: Clinical trials are vital for evaluation of safety and efficacy of new
treatments. However, clinical trials are resource-intensive, time-consuming and
expensive to conduct, where errors in trial design, reduced efficacy, and
safety events can result in significant delays, financial losses, and damage to
reputation. These risks underline the importance of informed and strategic
decisions in trial design to mitigate these risks and improve the chances of a
successful trial. Identifying similar historical trials is critical as these
trials can provide an important reference for potential pitfalls and challenges
including serious adverse events, dosage inaccuracies, recruitment
difficulties, patient adherence issues, etc. Addressing these challenges in
trial design can lead to development of more effective study protocols with
optimized patient safety and trial efficiency. In this paper, we present a
novel method to identify similar historical trials by summarizing clinical
trial protocols and searching for similar trials based on a query trial's
protocol. Our approach significantly outperforms all baselines, achieving up to
a 78% improvement in recall@1 and a 53% improvement in precision@1 over the
best baseline. We also show that our method outperforms all other baselines in
partial trial similarity search and zero-shot patient-trial matching,
highlighting its superior utility in these tasks.

Conclusion: facets为抽象论证框架中的精细推理提供了一种高效且实用的方法。

Abstract: Argumentation is a central subarea of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for
modeling and reasoning about arguments. The semantics of abstract argumentation
frameworks (AFs) is given by sets of arguments (extensions) and conditions on
the relationship between them, such as stable or admissible. Today's solvers
implement tasks such as finding extensions, deciding credulous or skeptical
acceptance, counting, or enumerating extensions. While these tasks are well
charted, the area between decision, counting/enumeration and fine-grained
reasoning requires expensive reasoning so far. We introduce a novel concept
(facets) for reasoning between decision and enumeration. Facets are arguments
that belong to some extensions (credulous) but not to all extensions
(skeptical). They are most natural when a user aims to navigate, filter, or
comprehend the significance of specific arguments, according to their needs. We
study the complexity and show that tasks involving facets are much easier than
counting extensions. Finally, we provide an implementation, and conduct
experiments to demonstrate feasibility.

Abstract: Plastic injection molding remains essential to modern manufacturing. However,
optimizing process parameters to balance product quality and profitability
under dynamic environmental and economic conditions remains a persistent
challenge. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
framework for real-time process optimization in injection molding, integrating
product quality and profitability into the control objective. A profit function
was developed to reflect real-world manufacturing costs, incorporating resin,
mold wear, and electricity prices, including time-of-use variations. Surrogate
models were constructed to predict product quality and cycle time, enabling
efficient offline training of DRL agents using soft actor-critic (SAC) and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed DRL framework can dynamically adapt to seasonal and
operational variations, consistently maintaining product quality while
maximizing profit. Compared to traditional optimization methods such as genetic
algorithms, the DRL models achieved comparable economic performance with up to
135x faster inference speeds, making them well-suited for real-time
applications. The framework's scalability and adaptability highlight its
potential as a foundation for intelligent, data-driven decision-making in
modern manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Road terrains play a crucial role in ensuring the driving safety of
autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, existing sensors of AVs, including cameras
and Lidars, are susceptible to variations in lighting and weather conditions,
making it challenging to achieve real-time perception of road conditions. In
this paper, we propose an illumination-aware multi-modal fusion network (IMF),
which leverages both exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception and optimizes
the fusion process based on illumination features. We introduce an
illumination-perception sub-network to accurately estimate illumination
features. Moreover, we design a multi-modal fusion network which is able to
dynamically adjust weights of different modalities according to illumination
features. We enhance the optimization process by pre-training of the
illumination-perception sub-network and incorporating illumination loss as one
of the training constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the IMF
shows a superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The
comparison results with single modality perception methods highlight the
comprehensive advantages of multi-modal fusion in accurately perceiving road
terrains under varying lighting conditions. Our dataset is available at:

Method: 测试公开正则表达式，手动创建可分解正则表达式，并使用正则表达式合成自动生成正则表达式。

Result: 正则表达式合成生成的正则表达式误报更少，但漏报略有增加。

Conclusion: 正则表达式合成是一种有效方法，可用于从文本中识别复杂日期和日期范围。

Abstract: Dates often contribute towards highly impactful medical decisions, but it is
rarely clear how to extract this data. AI has only just begun to be used
transcribe such documents, and common methods are either to trust that the
output produced by a complex AI model, or to parse the text using regular
expressions. Recent work has established that regular expressions are an
explainable form of logic, but it is difficult to decompose these into the
component parts that are required to construct precise UNIX timestamps. First,
we test publicly-available regular expressions, and we found that these were
unable to capture a significant number of our dates. Next, we manually created
easily-decomposable regular expressions, and we found that these were able to
detect the majority of real dates, but also a lot of sequences of text that
look like dates. Finally, we used regular expression synthesis to automatically
identify regular expressions from the reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps that
we created. We find that regular expressions created by regular expression
synthesis detect far fewer sequences of text that look like dates than those
that were manually created, at the cost of a slight increase to the number of
missed dates. Overall, our results show that regular expressions can be created
through regular expression synthesis to identify complex dates and date ranges
in text transcriptions. To our knowledge, our proposed way of learning
deterministic logic by reverse-engineering several many-one mappings and
feeding these into a regular expression synthesiser is a new approach.

Result: 在多个基准模型和数据集上，PSNR和SSIM有所提升，视频纹理细节保留更好。

Conclusion: Ghost特征和RNN的结合有效减少了冗余并提升了视频超分辨率性能。

Abstract: Modern video super-resolution (VSR) systems based on convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) require huge computational costs. The problem of feature
redundancy is present in most models in many domains, but is rarely discussed
in VSR. We experimentally observe that many features in VSR models are also
similar to each other, so we propose to use "Ghost features" to reduce this
redundancy. We also analyze the so-called "gradient disappearance" phenomenon
generated by the conventional recurrent convolutional network (RNN) model, and
combine the Ghost module with RNN to complete the modeling on time series. The
current frame is used as input to the model together with the next frame, the
output of the previous frame and the hidden state. Extensive experiments on
several benchmark models and datasets show that the PSNR and SSIM of our
proposed modality are improved to some extent. Some texture details in the
video are also better preserved.

conduct case studies (OpenAI, Adobe, NVIDIA, Meta, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs) to
illustrate patterns of valuation premium and misalignment. Our findings
indicate that AI-native firms commanded outsized valuation premiums anchored to
future potential, while traditional companies integrating AI experienced
re-ratings subject to proof of tangible returns. We argue that CRR can help
identify valuation misalignment risk-where market prices diverge from realized
AI-driven value. We conclude with policy recommendations to improve

Abstract: Releasing useful information from datasets with hierarchical structures while
preserving individual privacy presents a significant challenge. Standard
privacy-preserving mechanisms, and in particular Differential Privacy, often
require careful allocation of a finite privacy budget across different levels
and components of the hierarchy. Sub-optimal allocation can lead to either
excessive noise, rendering the data useless, or to insufficient protections for
sensitive information. This paper addresses the critical problem of optimal
privacy budget allocation for hierarchical data release. It formulates this
challenge as a constrained optimization problem, aiming to maximize data
utility subject to a total privacy budget while considering the inherent
trade-offs between data granularity and privacy loss. The proposed approach is
supported by theoretical analysis and validated through comprehensive
experiments on real hierarchical datasets. These experiments demonstrate that
optimal privacy budget allocation significantly enhances the utility of the
released data and improves the performance of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Malware presents a persistent threat to user privacy and data integrity. To
combat this, machine learning-based (ML-based) malware detection (MD) systems
have been developed. However, these systems have increasingly been attacked in
recent years, undermining their effectiveness in practice. While the security
risks associated with ML-based MD systems have garnered considerable attention,
the majority of prior works is limited to adversarial malware examples, lacking
a comprehensive analysis of practical security risks. This paper addresses this
gap by utilizing the CIA principles to define the scope of security risks. We
then deconstruct ML-based MD systems into distinct operational stages, thus
developing a stage-based taxonomy. Utilizing this taxonomy, we summarize the
technical progress and discuss the gaps in the attack and defense proposals
related to the ML-based MD systems within each stage. Subsequently, we conduct
two case studies, using both inter-stage and intra-stage analyses according to
the stage-based taxonomy to provide new empirical insights. Based on these
analyses and insights, we suggest potential future directions from both
inter-stage and intra-stage perspectives.

discrete sampler of crystal lattices; permutation-invariant, transformer-based
autoregressive sampling of Wyckoff positions, elements, and numbers of
symmetrically unique atoms; and space group equivariant diffusion of atomic
coordinates. We show that space group equivariant vector fields automatically
live in the tangent spaces of the Wyckoff positions. SGEquiDiff achieves
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets as assessed by
quantitative proxy metrics and quantum mechanical calculations.

Motivation: 随着社会被计算系统中介化，公众需要批判和协商计算形式的能力，以应对其带来的认知挑战。

Conclusion: 呼吁通过跨学科研究应对计算系统对社会的渗透和影响。

Abstract: If an active citizen should increasingly be a computationally enlightened
one, replacing the autonomy of reason with the heteronomy of algorithms, then I
argue in this article that we must begin teaching the principles of critiquing
the computal through new notions of what we might call digital Bildung. Indeed,
if civil society itself is mediated by computational systems and media, the
public use of reason must also be complemented by skills for negotiating and
using these computal forms to articulate such critique. Not only is there a
need to raise the intellectual tone regarding computation and its related
softwarization processes, but there is an urgent need to attend to the likely
epistemic challenges from computation which, as presently constituted, tends
towards justification through a philosophy of utility rather than through a
philosophy of care for the territory of the intellect. We therefore need to
develop an approach to this field that uses concepts and methods drawn from
philosophy, politics, history, anthropology, sociology, media studies, computer
science, and the humanities more generally, to try to understand these issues -
particularly the way in which software and data increasingly penetrate our
everyday life and the pressures and fissures that are created. We must, in
other words, move to undertake a critical interdisciplinary research program to
understand the way in which these systems are created, instantiated, and
normatively engendered in both specific and general contexts.

datasets containing diverse humanoid facial expressions with proper annotations
hinders progress in realistic humanoid facial expression imitation. To address
these challenges, we introduce X2C (Anything to Control), a dataset featuring
nuanced facial expressions for realistic humanoid imitation. With X2C, we
contribute: 1) a high-quality, high-diversity, large-scale dataset comprising
100,000 (image, control value) pairs. Each image depicts a humanoid robot
displaying a diverse range of facial expressions, annotated with 30 control
values representing the ground-truth expression configuration; 2) X2CNet, a
novel human-to-humanoid facial expression imitation framework that learns the
correspondence between nuanced humanoid expressions and their underlying
control values from X2C. It enables facial expression imitation in the wild for
different human performers, providing a baseline for the imitation task,
showcasing the potential value of our dataset; 3) real-world demonstrations on
a physical humanoid robot, highlighting its capability to advance realistic

Motivation: 在离线教育环境中，数据质量差、规模有限和高度异质性限制了高级机器学习模型的应用。此外，教育理论缺乏可量化指标，难以用于数据驱动建模。

Method: 通过数据分析和教育文献综述，识别学生行为的突变作为辍学风险的早期信号，提出DMSW模型，整合学业表现和行为数据，动态捕捉行为模式。

Result: DMSW模型比传统方法预测准确率提高15%，能更早识别高风险学生，提供及时支持。

Conclusion: DMSW模型填补了理论与实践的差距，为教育者提供了增强学生保留率和成果的创新工具。

Abstract: Timely prediction of students at high risk of dropout is critical for early
intervention and improving educational outcomes. However, in offline
educational settings, poor data quality, limited scale, and high heterogeneity
often hinder the application of advanced machine learning models. Furthermore,
while educational theories provide valuable insights into dropout phenomena,
the lack of quantifiable metrics for key indicators limits their use in
data-driven modeling. Through data analysis and a review of educational
literature, we identified abrupt changes in student behavior as key early
signals of dropout risk. To address this, we propose the Dual-Modal Multiscale
Sliding Window (DMSW) Model, which integrates academic performance and
behavioral data to dynamically capture behavior patterns using minimal data.
The DMSW model improves prediction accuracy by 15% compared to traditional
methods, enabling educators to identify high-risk students earlier, provide
timely support, and foster a more inclusive learning environment. Our analysis
highlights key behavior patterns, offering practical insights for preventive
strategies and tailored support. These findings bridge the gap between theory
and practice in dropout prediction, giving educators an innovative tool to
enhance student retention and outcomes.

Abstract: While the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, its long-term
effects persist through Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), commonly known
as Long COVID. There remains substantial uncertainty regarding both its
duration and optimal management strategies. PASC manifests as a diverse array
of persistent or newly emerging symptoms--ranging from fatigue, dyspnea, and
neurologic impairments (e.g., brain fog), to cardiovascular, pulmonary, and
musculoskeletal abnormalities--that extend beyond the acute infection phase.
This heterogeneous presentation poses substantial challenges for clinical
assessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning. In this paper, we focus on
imaging findings that may suggest fibrotic damage in the lungs, a critical
manifestation characterized by scarring of lung tissue, which can potentially
affect long-term respiratory function in patients with PASC. This study
introduces a novel multi-center chest CT analysis framework that combines deep
learning and radiomics for fibrosis prediction. Our approach leverages
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and interpretable feature extraction,
achieving 82.2% accuracy and 85.5% AUC in classification tasks. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of Grad-CAM visualization and radiomics-based feature
analysis in providing clinically relevant insights for PASC-related lung
fibrosis prediction. Our findings highlight the potential of deep
learning-driven computational methods for early detection and risk assessment
of PASC-related lung fibrosis--presented for the first time in the literature.

Conclusion: 广告显著影响媒体报道，尤其是对企业广告主。

Abstract: This paper investigates advertising practices in print newspapers across
India using a novel data-driven approach. We develop a pipeline employing image
processing and OCR techniques to extract articles and advertisements from
digital versions of print newspapers with high accuracy. Applying this
methodology to five popular newspapers that span multiple regions and three
languages, English, Hindi, and Telugu, we assembled a dataset of more than
12,000 editions containing several hundred thousand advertisements.
Collectively, these newspapers reach a readership of over 100 million people.
Using this extensive dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to answer key
questions about print advertising: who advertises, what they advertise, when
they advertise, where they place their ads, and how they advertise. Our
findings reveal significant patterns, including the consistent level of print
advertising over the past six years despite declining print circulation, the
overrepresentation of company ads on prominent pages, and the disproportionate
revenue contributed by government ads. Furthermore, we examine whether
advertising in a newspaper influences the coverage an advertiser receives.
Through regression analyses on coverage volume and sentiment, we find strong
evidence supporting this hypothesis for corporate advertisers. The results
indicate a clear trend where increased advertising correlates with more
favorable and extensive media coverage, a relationship that remains robust over
time and across different levels of advertiser popularity.

Abstract: This work presents a user-centric recommendation framework, designed as a

  We have collected the historical Last.fm track playback records of a single
user over approximately 15 years. The collected dataset includes more than
90,000 playbacks and approximately 14,000 unique tracks.
  From track playback records, we have created a dataset of user temporal
contexts (each row is a specific moment when the user listened to certain music
descriptors). As music descriptors, we have used community-contributed Last.fm
tags and Spotify audio features. They represent the music that, throughout
years, the user has been listening to.
  Next, given the most relevant Last.fm tags of a moment (e.g. the hour of the
day), we predict the Spotify audio features that best fit the user preferences
in that particular moment. Finally, we use the predicted audio features to find
tracks similar to these features. The final aim is to recommend (and discover)
tracks that the user may feel like listening to at a particular moment.
  For our initial study case, we have chosen to predict only a single audio
feature target: danceability. The framework, however, allows to include more
target variables.
  The ability to learn the musical habits from a single user can be quite
powerful, and this framework could be extended to other users.

Abstract: Recently, the proliferation of omni-channel platforms has attracted interest
in customer journeys, particularly regarding their role in developing marketing
strategies. However, few efforts have been taken to quantitatively study or
comprehensively analyze them owing to the sequential nature of their data and
the complexity involved in analysis. In this study, we propose a novel approach
comprising three steps for analyzing customer journeys. First, the distance
between sequential data is defined and used to identify and visualize
representative sequences. Second, the likelihood of purchase is predicted based
on this distance. Third, if a sequence suggests no purchase, counterfactual
sequences are recommended to increase the probability of a purchase using a
proposed method, which extracts counterfactual explanations for sequential
data. A survey was conducted, and the data were analyzed; the results revealed
that typical sequences could be extracted, and the parts of those sequences
important for purchase could be detected. We believe that the proposed approach
can support improvements in various marketing activities.

Conclusion: GLOVA有效提升了模拟电路设计的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Analog/mixed-signal circuit design encounters significant challenges due to
performance degradation from process, voltage, and temperature (PVT)
variations. To achieve commercial-grade reliability, iterative manual design
revisions and extensive statistical simulations are required. While several
studies have aimed to automate variation aware analog design to reduce
time-to-market, the substantial mismatches in real-world wafers have not been
thoroughly addressed. In this paper, we present GLOVA, an analog circuit sizing
framework that effectively manages the impact of diverse random mismatches to
improve robustness against PVT variations. In the proposed approach,
risk-sensitive reinforcement learning is leveraged to account for the
reliability bound affected by PVT variations, and ensemble-based critic is
introduced to achieve sample-efficient learning. For design verification, we
also propose $\mu$-$\sigma$ evaluation and simulation reordering method to
reduce simulation costs of identifying failed designs. GLOVA supports
verification through industrial-level PVT variation evaluation methods,
including corner simulation as well as global and local Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations. Compared to previous state-of-the-art variation-aware analog
sizing frameworks, GLOVA achieves up to 80.5$\times$ improvement in sample
efficiency and 76.0$\times$ reduction in time.

Method: MOPO将对齐问题建模为带约束的KL正则化优化，主目标最大化，次目标通过安全阈值约束。直接利用成对偏好数据，无需点式奖励假设或启发式提示工程。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，MOPO逼近Pareto前沿；在1.3B参数模型上，MOPO获得更高奖励且Pareto优于基线。

Conclusion: MOPO有效解决多目标偏好对齐问题，具有优化稳定性和超参数鲁棒性。

Abstract: Post-training of LLMs with RLHF, and subsequently preference optimization
algorithms such as DPO, IPO, etc., made a big difference in improving human
alignment. However, all such techniques can only work with a single (human)
objective. In practice, human users have multiple objectives, such as
helpfulness and harmlessness, and there is no natural way to aggregate them
into a single objective. In this paper, we address the multi-objective
preference-alignment problem, where a policy must optimize several, potentially
conflicting, objectives. We introduce the Multi-Objective Preference
Optimization (MOPO) algorithm, which frames alignment as a constrained
KL-regularized optimization: the primary objective is maximized while secondary
objectives are lower-bounded by tunable safety thresholds. Unlike prior work,
MOPO operates directly on pairwise preference data, requires no point-wise
reward assumption, and avoids heuristic prompt-context engineering. The method
recovers policies on the Pareto front whenever the front is attainable;
practically, it reduces to simple closed-form iterative updates suitable for
large-scale training. On synthetic benchmarks with diverse canonical preference
structures, we show that MOPO approximates the Pareto front. When fine-tuning a
1.3B-parameter language model on real-world human-preference datasets, MOPO
attains higher rewards and yields policies that Pareto-dominate baselines;
ablation studies confirm optimization stability and robustness to
hyperparameters.

Conclusion: ShiQ为LLM微调提供了一种高效的Q学习方法，填补了现有RL方法的空白。

Abstract: The fine-tuning of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) using
reinforcement learning (RL) is generally formulated as direct policy
optimization. This approach was naturally favored as it efficiently improves a
pretrained LLM, seen as an initial policy. Another RL paradigm, Q-learning
methods, has received far less attention in the LLM community while
demonstrating major success in various non-LLM RL tasks. In particular,
Q-learning effectiveness comes from its sample efficiency and ability to learn
offline, which is particularly valuable given the high computational cost of
sampling with LLMs. However, naively applying a Q-learning-style update to the
model's logits is ineffective due to the specificity of LLMs. Our core
contribution is to derive theoretically grounded loss functions from Bellman
equations to adapt Q-learning methods to LLMs. To do so, we carefully adapt
insights from the RL literature to account for LLM-specific characteristics,
ensuring that the logits become reliable Q-value estimates. We then use this
loss to build a practical algorithm, ShiQ for Shifted-Q, that supports
off-policy, token-wise learning while remaining simple to implement. Finally,
we evaluate ShiQ on both synthetic data and real-world benchmarks, e.g.,
UltraFeedback and BFCL-V3, demonstrating its effectiveness in both single-turn
and multi-turn LLM settings

Method: 提出了一种简单有效的方法，用于纠正稀疏注意力输出的分布偏移，使其更接近二次注意力的分布。该方法可应用于任何稀疏注意力方法。

Result: 在131K RULER基准测试中，平均性能提升36%，恢复88%的二次注意力准确率，同时保持98.5%的稀疏性，使模型比Flash Attention 2快32倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀疏注意力性能下降的问题，显著提升了效率与性能的平衡。

Abstract: The attention mechanism of a transformer has a quadratic complexity, leading
to high inference costs and latency for long sequences. However, attention
matrices are mostly sparse, which implies that many entries may be omitted from
computation for efficient inference. Sparse attention inference methods aim to
reduce this computational burden; however, they also come with a troublesome
performance degradation. We discover that one reason for this degradation is
that the sparse calculation induces a distributional shift in the attention
outputs. The distributional shift causes decoding-time queries to fail to align
well with the appropriate keys from the prefill stage, leading to a drop in
performance. We propose a simple, novel, and effective procedure for correcting
this distributional shift, bringing the distribution of sparse attention
outputs closer to that of quadratic attention. Our method can be applied on top
of any sparse attention method, and results in an average 36%pt performance
increase, recovering 88% of quadratic attention accuracy on the 131K RULER
benchmark when applied on top of sliding window attention with sink tokens
while only adding a small overhead. Our method can maintain approximately 98.5%
sparsity over full quadratic attention, making our model 32 times faster than
Flash Attention 2 when processing 1M token prefills.

Conclusion: CRM是一种实用且通用的策略，能够显著提升奖励模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values. However, noisy preferences in human feedback often lead to
reward misgeneralization, where RMs overfit to spurious patterns and provide
misleading signals during policy optimization. We systematically analyze the
training dynamics of preference pairs and identify that noisy examples are
harder to fit and introduce instability. Empirical evidence shows that LLMs
optimized using reward models trained on full noisy datasets perform worse than
those trained on filtered, high-quality preferences. To address this, we
propose Collaborative Reward Modeling (CRM), an online framework that enhances
robustness by combining peer review and curriculum learning. Two reward models
are trained in parallel and assess each other's data selections to filter out
potential noise. Curriculum learning structures the preference data from easy
to hard, ensuring synchronized training and stable feedback. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CRM improves generalization, with up to 9.94
points of accuracy gain on RewardBench under 40 percent label noise. CRM is
also compatible with implicit-reward alignment methods, offering a practical
and versatile strategy for robust alignment.

Abstract: Understanding how Transformers work and how they process information is key
to the theoretical and empirical advancement of these machines. In this work,
we demonstrate the existence of two phenomena in Transformers, namely isolation
and continuity. Both of these phenomena hinder Transformers to learn even
simple pattern sequences. Isolation expresses that any learnable sequence must
be isolated from another learnable sequence, and hence some sequences cannot be
learned by a single Transformer at the same time. Continuity entails that an
attractor basin forms around a learned sequence, such that any sequence falling
in that basin will collapse towards the learned sequence. Here, we
mathematically prove these phenomena emerge in all Transformers that use
compact positional encoding, and design rigorous experiments, demonstrating
that the theoretical limitations we shed light on occur on the practical scale.

Conclusion: ARES是首个完全离线、鲁棒性强且不限于目标任务的奖励塑造方法。

Abstract: Sparse and delayed reward functions pose a significant obstacle for
real-world Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications. In this work, we propose
Attention-based REward Shaping (ARES), a general and robust algorithm which
uses a transformer's attention mechanism to generate shaped rewards and create
a dense reward function for any environment. ARES requires a set of episodes
and their final returns as input. It can be trained entirely offline and is
able to generate meaningful shaped rewards even when using small datasets or
episodes produced by agents taking random actions. ARES is compatible with any
RL algorithm and can handle any level of reward sparsity. In our experiments,
we focus on the most challenging case where rewards are fully delayed until the
end of each episode. We evaluate ARES across a diverse range of environments,
widely used RL algorithms, and baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
the shaped rewards it produces. Our results show that ARES can significantly
improve learning in delayed reward settings, enabling RL agents to train in
scenarios that would otherwise require impractical amounts of data or even be
unlearnable. To our knowledge, ARES is the first approach that works fully
offline, remains robust to extreme reward delays and low-quality data, and is
not limited to goal-based tasks.

Method: 应用机制可解释性技术分析教师模型（GPT2-small）和学生模型（DistilGPT2）的内部电路、表示和激活模式，并引入基于影响力加权的组件相似性对齐度量。

Result: 学生模型会重组、压缩或丢弃教师模型的组件，导致对更少组件的依赖；知识蒸馏保留了广泛的功能行为，但内部计算发生了显著变化。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏虽然保留了功能行为，但内部计算的变化可能影响蒸馏模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation compresses a larger neural model (teacher) into
smaller, faster student models by training them to match teacher outputs.
However, the internal computational transformations that occur during this
process remain poorly understood. We apply techniques from mechanistic
interpretability to analyze how internal circuits, representations, and
activation patterns differ between teacher and student. Focusing on GPT2-small
and its distilled counterpart DistilGPT2, we find that student models
reorganize, compress, and discard teacher components, often resulting in
stronger reliance on fewer individual components. To quantify functional
alignment beyond output similarity, we introduce an alignment metric based on
influence-weighted component similarity, validated across multiple tasks. Our
findings reveal that while knowledge distillation preserves broad functional
behaviors, it also causes significant shifts in internal computation, with
important implications for the robustness and generalization capacity of
distilled models.

Motivation: 解决现有模型合并方法在模型规模和任务多样性上的局限性，评估其在大型LLMs中的适用性。

Method: 基于开源语言模型（如Llama和Gemma），在五个关键领域（指令遵循、数学、多语言理解、编码和安全）上评估八种代表性合并方法。

Result: 模型合并对更强的基础模型表现更好，合并系数调整和稀疏化等技术有助于知识保留，但仍存在计算成本高、领域内性能差距等问题。

Conclusion: MergeBench为未来研究提供了基础，但模型合并在大规模LLM训练中的应用仍需进一步探索。

Abstract: Model merging provides a scalable alternative to multi-task training by
combining specialized finetuned models through parameter arithmetic, enabling
efficient deployment without the need for joint training or access to all task
data. While recent methods have shown promise, existing evaluations are limited
in both model scale and task diversity, leaving open questions about their
applicability to large, domain-specialized LLMs. To tackle the challenges, we
introduce MergeBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess model
merging at scale. MergeBench builds on state-of-the-art open-source language
models, including Llama and Gemma families at 2B to 9B scales, and covers five
key domains: instruction following, mathematics, multilingual understanding,
coding and safety. We standardize finetuning and evaluation protocols, and
assess eight representative merging methods across multi-task performance,
forgetting and runtime efficiency. Based on extensive experiments, we provide
practical guidelines for algorithm selection and share insights showing that
model merging tends to perform better on stronger base models, with techniques
such as merging coefficient tuning and sparsification improving knowledge
retention. However, several challenges remain, including the computational cost
on large models, the gap for in-domain performance compared to multi-task
models, and the underexplored role of model merging in standard LLM training
pipelines. We hope MergeBench provides a foundation for future research to
advance the understanding and practical application of model merging. We open

Conclusion: LARGO展示了通过梯度优化攻击LLM内部的有效性，为LLM安全性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Efficient red-teaming method to uncover vulnerabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial. While recent attacks often use LLMs as optimizers,
the discrete language space make gradient-based methods struggle. We introduce
LARGO (Latent Adversarial Reflection through Gradient Optimization), a novel
latent self-reflection attack that reasserts the power of gradient-based
optimization for generating fluent jailbreaking prompts. By operating within
the LLM's continuous latent space, LARGO first optimizes an adversarial latent
vector and then recursively call the same LLM to decode the latent into natural
language. This methodology yields a fast, effective, and transferable attack
that produces fluent and stealthy prompts. On standard benchmarks like AdvBench
and JailbreakBench, LARGO surpasses leading jailbreaking techniques, including
AutoDAN, by 44 points in attack success rate. Our findings demonstrate a potent
alternative to agentic LLM prompting, highlighting the efficacy of interpreting
and attacking LLM internals through gradient optimization.

Abstract: This paper presents AutoRAN, the first automated, weak-to-strong jailbreak
attack framework targeting large reasoning models (LRMs). At its core, AutoRAN
leverages a weak, less-aligned reasoning model to simulate the target model's
high-level reasoning structures, generates narrative prompts, and iteratively
refines candidate prompts by incorporating the target model's intermediate
reasoning steps. We evaluate AutoRAN against state-of-the-art LRMs including
GPT-o3/o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash across multiple benchmark datasets
(AdvBench, HarmBench, and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that AutoRAN
achieves remarkable success rates (approaching 100%) within one or a few turns
across different LRMs, even when judged by a robustly aligned external model.
This work reveals that leveraging weak reasoning models can effectively exploit
the critical vulnerabilities of much more capable reasoning models,
highlighting the need for improved safety measures specifically designed for
reasoning-based models. The code for replicating AutoRAN and running records

Abstract: Mixture of experts (MoE) methods are a key component in most large language
model architectures, including the recent series of DeepSeek models. Compared
to other MoE implementations, DeepSeekMoE stands out because of two unique
features: the deployment of a shared expert strategy and of the normalized
sigmoid gating mechanism. Despite the prominent role of DeepSeekMoE in the
success of the DeepSeek series of models, there have been only a few attempts
to justify theoretically the value of the shared expert strategy, while its
normalized sigmoid gating has remained unexplored. To bridge this gap, we
undertake a comprehensive theoretical study of these two features of
DeepSeekMoE from a statistical perspective. We perform a convergence analysis
of the expert estimation task to highlight the gains in sample efficiency for
both the shared expert strategy and the normalized sigmoid gating, offering
useful insights into the design of expert and gating structures. To verify
empirically our theoretical findings, we carry out several experiments on both
synthetic data and real-world datasets for (vision) language modeling tasks.
Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis of the router behaviors,
ranging from router saturation, router change rate, to expert utilization.

Abstract: We investigate the usage of Large Language Model (LLM) in collecting

covers state-actions visited by optimal policies, then later using an RL
algorithm to explore the environment and improve the policy suggested by the
LLM. Our algorithm, LORO, can both converge to an optimal policy and have a
high sample efficiency thanks to the LLM's good starting policy. On multiple
OpenAI Gym environments, such as CartPole and Pendulum, we empirically
demonstrate that LORO outperforms baseline algorithms such as pure LLM-based

Method: SubGCache通过子图嵌入聚类查询，为每个聚类构建代表性子图并预计算其KV缓存，从而在查询时重用缓存以节省计算。

Result: 实验表明，SubGCache在多个LLM和RAG框架上实现了高达6.68倍的TTFT减少，且生成质量相当或更好。

Conclusion: SubGCache是一种高效的方法，能够显著提升基于图的RAG系统的推理效率。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language
models (LLMs) to incorporate structured knowledge via graph retrieval as
contextual input, enhancing more accurate and context-aware reasoning. We
observe that for different queries, it could retrieve similar subgraphs as
prompts, and thus we propose SubGCache, which aims to reduce inference latency
by reusing computation across queries with similar structural prompts (i.e.,
subgraphs). Specifically, SubGCache clusters queries based on subgraph
embeddings, constructs a representative subgraph for each cluster, and
pre-computes the key-value (KV) cache of the representative subgraph. For each
query with its retrieved subgraph within a cluster, it reuses the pre-computed
KV cache of the representative subgraph of the cluster without computing the KV
tensors again for saving computation. Experiments on two new datasets across
multiple LLM backbones and graph-based RAG frameworks demonstrate that
SubGCache consistently reduces inference latency with comparable and even
improved generation quality, achieving up to 6.68$\times$ reduction in
time-to-first-token (TTFT).

Result: 在ALFWorld和WebShop基准测试中，性能分别提升12%和9%，同时保持相同的GPU内存和计算成本。

Conclusion: GiGPO是一种高效且稳定的RL算法，适用于长序列LLM代理训练。

Abstract: Recent advances in group-based reinforcement learning (RL) have driven
frontier large language models (LLMs) in single-turn tasks like mathematical
reasoning. However, their scalability to long-horizon LLM agent training
remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold
over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit
assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this
work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL
algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while
preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory,
and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating
relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative
advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level,
GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively
constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across
trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together,
enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure
effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step
effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We
evaluate GiGPO on two challenging agent benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, using
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers
fine-grained per-step credit signals and achieves performance gains of > 12\%
on ALFWorld and > 9\% on WebShop over the GRPO baseline: all while maintaining
the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no
additional time cost.

Motivation: HyperAttention的均匀残差采样限制了关键键的捕获，导致困惑度较高。本文旨在通过预评分机制优化这一过程。

Result: 在ChatGLM2（131k token上下文）上，困惑度从12降至8.3；在ViT上，与LevAttention相比，特定参数下表现更优。

Conclusion: 预评分机制显著提升了分层注意力机制的效率，为Transformer模型提供了速度与准确性的平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer architectures deeply enhance long-context
language modeling. Among them, HyperAttention achieves competitive efficiency
by combining a single-level LSH-based clustering with uniform residual
sampling. However,such a sampling limits crucial keys' capturing, which in turn
raises the overall perplexity. In this paper, we propose a pre-scoring
mechanism to assist HyperAttention to prioritize significant keys.
Specifically, we introduce three scoring methods: K-means clustering, K-median
clustering, and leverage score-based ranking (inspired by LevAttention) to
filter keys effectively. We further replace HyperAttention's original uniform
residual sampling entirely, relying exclusively on our pre-scoring mechanism.
Experiments on ChatGLM2 (131k token context) reduce perplexity from 12 to 8.3,
which outperforms standard HyperAttention. Moreover, when running on the
Vision-Transformer (ViT), our method shows that it can guarantee similar
accuracy compared with LevAttention, and will surpass LevAttention given
specific parameters. Although this method introduces computational overhead,
its combination with HyperAttention remains 20 times faster than
FlashAttention, providing a balanced trade-off between speed and modeling
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating pre-scoring
into hierarchical attention mechanisms, significantly improving Transformer's
efficiency.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的计算和存储需求日益增长，二值量化方法通过用二进制矩阵替换权重矩阵并减少乘法运算来提升效率，但传统方法在严重量化约束下会导致精度显著下降。

Method: DBF将稠密权重矩阵分解为两个二进制矩阵及其缩放向量的乘积，通过调整分解的中间维度实现细粒度的压缩比控制，并基于通道剪枝标准估计非均匀层间压缩比。

Result: 在1比特/权重范围内，DBF优于现有二值化方法；在2比特/权重范围内，与QuIP#和QTIP等最佳量化方法竞争。

Conclusion: DBF在保持高效性的同时，提供了灵活的压缩比控制，为LLMs的量化压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Binary quantization approaches, which replace weight matrices with binary
matrices and substitute costly multiplications with cheaper additions, offer a
computationally efficient approach to address the increasing computational and
storage requirements of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the severe
quantization constraint ($\pm1$) can lead to significant accuracy degradation.
In this paper, we propose Double Binary Factorization (DBF), a novel method
that factorizes dense weight matrices into products of two binary (sign)
matrices, each accompanied by scaling vectors. DBF preserves the efficiency
advantages of binary representations while achieving compression rates that are
competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, in a
1-bit per weight range, DBF is better than existing binarization approaches. In
a 2-bit per weight range, DBF is competitive with the best quantization methods
like QuIP\# and QTIP. Unlike most existing compression techniques, which offer
limited compression level choices, DBF allows fine-grained control over
compression ratios by adjusting the factorization's intermediate dimension.
Based on this advantage, we further introduce an algorithm for estimating
non-uniform layer-wise compression ratios for DBF, based on previously
developed channel pruning criteria.

Conclusion: 新架构显著提升了POMDPs中的样本效率和性能，适用于实际RL场景。

Abstract: In real-world reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios, agents often encounter
partial observability, where incomplete or noisy information obscures the true
state of the environment. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
(POMDPs) are commonly used to model these environments, but effective
performance requires memory mechanisms to utilise past observations. While
recurrence networks have traditionally addressed this need, transformer-based
models have recently shown improved sample efficiency in RL tasks. However,
their application to POMDPs remains underdeveloped, and their real-world
deployment is constrained due to the high parameter count. This work introduces
a novel bi-recurrent model architecture that improves sample efficiency and
reduces model parameter count in POMDP scenarios. The architecture replaces the
multiple feed forward layers with a single layer of bi-directional recurrence
unit to better capture and utilize sequential dependencies and contextual
information. This approach improves the model's ability to handle partial
observability and increases sample efficiency, enabling effective learning from
comparatively fewer interactions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
model architecture, experiments were conducted on a total of 23 POMDP
environments. The proposed model architecture outperforms existing
transformer-based, attention-based, and recurrence-based methods by a margin
ranging from 87.39% to 482.04% on average across the 23 POMDP environments.

Result: 高斯权重采样具有可扩展性（支持低至FP6的参数和高至9位的噪声）、高效性（A100 GPU上计算开销低至1.40%）和稳定性（在GPT2和Llama2上性能接近或超过BF16基线）。

Conclusion: PQT结合高斯权重采样为低精度浮点参数训练提供了高效、可扩展且稳定的解决方案，适用于大规模LLM训练。

Abstract: Ever-growing scale of large language models (LLMs) is pushing for improved
efficiency, favoring fully quantized training (FQT) over BF16. While FQT
accelerates training, it faces consistency challenges and requires searching
over an exponential number of cases, each needing over 200B tokens to ensure
stability.
  Pseudo-quantization training (PQT) addresses the issues of FQT, although it
is not well-studied. We explore the practical implications of PQT in detail and
propose a noise distribution $R$ that is floating-point (FP)-friendly, with
ideal properties including stochastic precision annealing. As a result, the
proposed method serves as an effective theoretical foundation for low-precision
FP parameters through PQT, utilizing efficient fake quantization via an
addition and subsequent FP casting.
  We demonstrate that Gaussian weight sampling is (1) scalable: supports
low-precision FP parameters down to FP6 and high-precision noise up to 9-bit
with BF16 operator. The proposed method is (2) efficient: incurring
computational overhead as low as 1.40\% on the A100 GPU in terms of Llama2
training tokens per second, and requiring 2 bytes per parameter in GPU memory.
We demonstrate that PQT with Gaussian weight sampling is (3) stable: closely
following or even surpassing performance of the BF16 baseline while
pre-training GPT2 and Llama2 models with up to 1B parameters and 300B tokens.

Abstract: The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is increasingly favored for
scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently, but it depends on
heterogeneous compute and memory resources. These factors jointly affect system
Cost, Accuracy, and Performance (CAP), making trade-offs inevitable. Existing

achieving an optimal balance across CAP is difficult with current hardware; MoE
systems typically optimize two of the three dimensions at the expense of the
third-a dynamic we term the MoE-CAP trade-off. To visualize this, we propose

Result: 在1,440个NVIDIA Hopper GPU上训练352B MoE模型时，吞吐量达到1.41M tokens/s，效率比Megatron-LM提升1.88倍。

Conclusion: MegaScale-MoE为MoE模型的高效训练提供了系统设计经验，有望推动未来MoE系统的研究。

Abstract: We present MegaScale-MoE, a production system tailored for the efficient
training of large-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. MoE emerges as a
promising architecture to scale large language models (LLMs) to unprecedented
sizes, thereby enhancing model performance. However, existing MoE training
systems experience a degradation in training efficiency, exacerbated by the
escalating scale of MoE models and the continuous evolution of hardware.
  Recognizing the pivotal role of efficient communication in enhancing MoE
training, MegaScale-MoE customizes communication-efficient parallelism
strategies for attention and FFNs in each MoE layer and adopts a holistic
approach to overlap communication with computation at both inter- and
intra-operator levels. Additionally, MegaScale-MoE applies communication
compression with adjusted communication patterns to lower precision, further
improving training efficiency. When training a 352B MoE model on 1,440 NVIDIA
Hopper GPUs, MegaScale-MoE achieves a training throughput of 1.41M tokens/s,
improving the efficiency by 1.88$\times$ compared to Megatron-LM. We share our
operational experience in accelerating MoE training and hope that by offering
our insights in system design, this work will motivate future research in MoE
systems.

Result: 框架能更准确地连接评估证据与模型能力声明，提升评估的实用性和决策效果。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI系统评估提供了更科学的方法，适用于多利益相关方的评估需求。

Abstract: While the capabilities and utility of AI systems have advanced, rigorous
norms for evaluating these systems have lagged. Grand claims, such as models
achieving general reasoning capabilities, are supported with model performance
on narrow benchmarks, like performance on graduate-level exam questions, which
provide a limited and potentially misleading assessment. We provide a
structured approach for reasoning about the types of evaluative claims that can
be made given the available evidence. For instance, our framework helps
determine whether performance on a mathematical benchmark is an indication of
the ability to solve problems on math tests or instead indicates a broader
ability to reason. Our framework is well-suited for the contemporary paradigm
in machine learning, where various stakeholders provide measurements and
evaluations that downstream users use to validate their claims and decisions.
At the same time, our framework also informs the construction of evaluations
designed to speak to the validity of the relevant claims. By leveraging
psychometrics' breakdown of validity, evaluations can prioritize the most
critical facets for a given claim, improving empirical utility and
decision-making efficacy. We illustrate our framework through detailed case
studies of vision and language model evaluations, highlighting how explicitly
considering validity strengthens the connection between evaluation evidence and
the claims being made.

TL;DR: TokenWeave提出了一种Token-Splitting技术，通过将推理批次中的令牌分成两个子集并重叠计算与通信，优化了大型语言模型的分布式推理性能。结合层归一化计算的顺序优化和新型融合AllReduce-RMSNorm内核，显著降低了通信开销，实现了高达29%的延迟和26%的吞吐量提升。


<details>

Motivation: 分布式推理大型语言模型（LLMs）时，即使使用高速互连（如NVLINK），通信开销仍高达20%。现有技术通过细粒度任务分解和通信重叠来缓解，但会引入额外开销。TokenWeave旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 1. Token-Splitting技术将令牌分成两个子集，重叠计算与通信。2. 优化层归一化计算顺序。3. 实现融合AllReduce-RMSNorm内核，利用NVIDIA Hopper GPU的Multimem指令支持，仅需2-8个SMs。

Result: 实验显示，TokenWeave在多种模型和工作负载下，实现了高达29%的延迟降低和26%的吞吐量提升，某些情况下甚至优于无通信的等效模型。

Conclusion: TokenWeave通过创新的令牌分割和内核优化，显著提升了LLM分布式推理的效率，为高性能推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Distributed inference of large language models (LLMs) can introduce overheads
of up to 20% even over GPUs connected via high-speed interconnects such as
NVLINK. Multiple techniques have been proposed to mitigate these overheads by
decomposing computations into finer-grained tasks and overlapping communication
with sub-tasks as they complete. However, fine-grained decomposition of a large
computation into many smaller computations on GPUs results in overheads.
Further, the communication itself uses many streaming multiprocessors (SMs),
adding to the overhead.
  We present TokenWeave to address these challenges. TokenWeave proposes a
Token-Splitting technique that divides the tokens in the inference batch into
two approximately equal subsets in a wave-aware manner. The computation of one
subset is then overlapped with the communication of the other. In addition,
TokenWeave optimizes the order of the layer normalization computation with
respect to communication operations and implements a novel fused
AllReduce-RMSNorm kernel carefully leveraging Multimem instruction support
available on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs. These optimizations allow TokenWeave to
perform communication and RMSNorm using only 2-8 SMs. Moreover, our kernel
enables the memory bound RMSNorm to be overlapped with the other batch's
computation, providing additional gains. Our evaluations demonstrate up to 29%
latency gains and up to 26% throughput gains across multiple models and
workloads. In several settings, TokenWeave results in better performance
compared to an equivalent model with all communication removed.

Result: 实验表明CAPTime在多模态时间序列预测任务中表现优越，尤其在数据稀缺情况下具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CAPTime成功解决了文本与时间序列融合的挑战，同时保留了LLM的分布建模能力。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is important for applications spanning energy
markets, climate analysis, and traffic management. However, existing methods
struggle to effectively integrate exogenous texts and align them with the
probabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs). Current approaches either
employ shallow text-time series fusion via basic prompts or rely on
deterministic numerical decoding that conflict with LLMs' token-generation
paradigm, which limits contextual awareness and distribution modeling. To
address these limitations, we propose CAPTime, a context-aware probabilistic
multimodal time series forecasting method that leverages text-informed
abstraction and autoregressive LLM decoding. Our method first encodes temporal
patterns using a pretrained time series encoder, then aligns them with textual
contexts via learnable interactions to produce joint multimodal
representations. By combining a mixture of distribution experts with frozen
LLMs, we enable context-aware probabilistic forecasting while preserving LLMs'
inherent distribution modeling capabilities. Experiments on diverse time series
forecasting tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization of
CAPTime, particularly in multimodal scenarios. Additional analysis highlights
its robustness in data-scarce scenarios through hybrid probabilistic decoding.

Conclusion: Logo-LLM通过充分利用LLM的层次化表示，显著提升了时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical across multiple domains, where time
series data exhibits both local patterns and global dependencies. While
Transformer-based methods effectively capture global dependencies, they often
overlook short-term local variations in time series. Recent methods that adapt
large language models (LLMs) into time series forecasting inherit this
limitation by treating LLMs as black-box encoders, relying solely on the
final-layer output and underutilizing hierarchical representations. To address
this limitation, we propose Logo-LLM, a novel LLM-based framework that
explicitly extracts and models multi-scale temporal features from different
layers of a pre-trained LLM. Through empirical analysis, we show that shallow
layers of LLMs capture local dynamics in time series, while deeper layers
encode global trends. Moreover, Logo-LLM introduces lightweight Local-Mixer and
Global-Mixer modules to align and integrate features with the temporal input
across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Logo-LLM achieves
superior performance across diverse benchmarks, with strong generalization in
few-shot and zero-shot settings while maintaining low computational overhead.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) as foundation models have significantly
enhanced performance across a wide range of visual and textual tasks, without
requiring large-scale training from scratch for downstream tasks. However,
these deterministic VLMs fail to capture the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty
in natural language and visual data. Recent probabilistic post-hoc adaptation
methods address this by mapping deterministic embeddings onto probability
distributions; however, existing approaches do not account for the asymmetric
uncertainty structure of the modalities, and the constraint that meaningful
deterministic embeddings reside on a unit hypersphere, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we address the asymmetric uncertainty
structure inherent in textual and visual data, and propose AsymVLM to build
probabilistic embeddings from pre-trained VLMs on the unit hypersphere,
enabling uncertainty quantification. We validate the effectiveness of the
probabilistic embeddings on established benchmarks, and present comprehensive
ablation studies demonstrating the inherent nature of asymmetry in the
uncertainty structure of textual and visual data.

Conclusion: RDD成功统一了两种探索方法，在高维空间中保持了预测误差方法的优势，同时实现了类似伪计数方法的探索衰减。

Abstract: Exploration remains a critical challenge in online reinforcement learning, as
an agent must effectively explore unknown environments to achieve high returns.
Currently, the main exploration algorithms are primarily count-based methods
and curiosity-based methods, with prediction-error methods being a prominent
example. In this paper, we propose a novel method called \textbf{R}andom
\textbf{D}istribution \textbf{D}istillation (RDD), which samples the output of
a target network from a normal distribution. RDD facilitates a more extensive
exploration by explicitly treating the difference between the prediction
network and the target network as an intrinsic reward. Furthermore, by
introducing randomness into the output of the target network for a given state
and modeling it as a sample from a normal distribution, intrinsic rewards are
bounded by two key components: a pseudo-count term ensuring proper exploration
decay and a discrepancy term accounting for predictor convergence. We
demonstrate that RDD effectively unifies both count-based and prediction-error
approaches. It retains the advantages of prediction-error methods in
high-dimensional spaces, while also implementing an intrinsic reward decay mode
akin to the pseudo-count method. In the experimental section, RDD is compared
with more advanced methods in a series of environments. Both theoretical
analysis and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach in
improving online exploration for reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is critical, particularly in
high-stakes domains where biased decisions can lead to serious societal
consequences. Existing preprocessing approaches generally lack transparent
mechanisms for identifying which features or instances are responsible for
unfairness. This obscures the rationale behind data modifications. We introduce
FairSHAP, a novel pre-processing framework that leverages Shapley value
attribution to improve both individual and group fairness. FairSHAP identifies
fairness-critical instances in the training data using an interpretable measure
of feature importance, and systematically modifies them through instance-level
matching across sensitive groups. This process reduces discriminative risk - an
individual fairness metric - while preserving data integrity and model
accuracy. We demonstrate that FairSHAP significantly improves demographic
parity and equality of opportunity across diverse tabular datasets, achieving
fairness gains with minimal data perturbation and, in some cases, improved
predictive performance. As a model-agnostic and transparent method, FairSHAP
integrates seamlessly into existing machine learning pipelines and provides

Conclusion: 视觉规划是一种可行且有前景的替代方案，为图像推理任务开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have substantially enhanced machine reasoning across diverse
tasks. However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for
both expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is
present. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most
natural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving
spatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new
paradigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual
representations, independent of text. In this paradigm, planning is executed
via sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual
domain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a
novel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement
Learning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models,
leading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of
representative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our
visual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct
reasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a
viable and promising alternative to language-based reasoning, opening new

Abstract: From a multi-model compression perspective, model merging enables
memory-efficient serving of multiple models fine-tuned from the same base, but
suffers from degraded performance due to interference among their task-specific
parameter adjustments (i.e., deltas). In this paper, we reformulate model
merging as a compress-and-retrieve scheme, revealing that the task interference
arises from the summation of irrelevant deltas during model retrieval. To
address this issue, we use random orthogonal transformations to decorrelate
these vectors into self-cancellation. We show that this approach drastically
reduces interference, improving performance across both vision and language
tasks. Since these transformations are fully defined by random seeds, adding
new models requires no extra memory. Further, their data- and model-agnostic
nature enables easy addition or removal of models with minimal compute
overhead, supporting efficient and flexible multi-model serving.

Abstract: Recent research highlights the potential of multimodal foundation models in
tackling complex decision-making challenges. However, their large parameters
make real-world deployment resource-intensive and often impractical for
constrained systems. Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for
task-specific agents but suffers from high sample complexity, limiting
practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce LVLM to
Policy (LVLM2P), a novel framework that distills knowledge from large
vision-language models (LVLM) into more efficient RL agents. Our approach
leverages the LVLM as a teacher, providing instructional actions based on
trajectories collected by the RL agent, which helps reduce less meaningful
exploration in the early stages of learning, thereby significantly accelerating
the agent's learning progress. Additionally, by leveraging the LVLM to suggest
actions directly from visual observations, we eliminate the need for manual
textual descriptors of the environment, enhancing applicability across diverse
tasks. Experiments show that LVLM2P significantly enhances the sample
efficiency of baseline RL algorithms.

Abstract: Driven by the relentless growth in model parameters, which renders full
fine-tuning prohibitively expensive for large-scale deployment,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for
rapidly adapting large models to a wide range of downstream tasks. Among the
PEFT family, orthogonal fine-tuning and its variants have demonstrated
remarkable performance by preserving hyperspherical energy, which encodes
pairwise angular similarity between neurons. However, these methods are
inherently memory-inefficient due to the need to store intermediate activations
from multiple full-dimensional sparse matrices. To address this limitation, we
propose Memory-efficient Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (MOFT) with principal subspace
adaptation. Specifically, we first establish a theoretical condition under
which orthogonal transformations within a low-rank subspace preserve
hyperspherical energy. Based on this insight, we constrain orthogonal
fine-tuning to the principal subspace defined by the top-r components obtained
through singular value decomposition and impose an additional constraint on the
projection matrix to satisfy the preservation condition. To enhance MOFT's
flexibility across tasks, we relax strict orthogonality by introducing two
learnable scaling vectors. Extensive experiments on 37 diverse tasks and four
models across NLP and CV demonstrate that MOFT consistently outperforms key
baselines while significantly reducing the memory footprint of orthogonal
fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 'grokking'的远非平衡性质为优化器设计提供了新思路，同时否定了仅归因于权重范数演化的理论。

Abstract: Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central
question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where
NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a
near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying
mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for
grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a
physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is
the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of
liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later
generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration.
This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density)
landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in
transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in
the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous
theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a
high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking
entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's
far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on
Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any
constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides
strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to
weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new
potential ways for optimizer design.

Abstract: We study the problem of certifying the stability of closed-loop systems under
control policies derived from optimal control or reinforcement learning (RL).
Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict step-wise decrease in the Lyapunov
function but such a certificate is difficult to construct for a learned control
policy. The value function associated with an RL policy is a natural Lyapunov
function candidate but it is not clear how it should be modified. To gain
intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make
two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value
function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the
system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease
requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only
decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider
the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov
functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms.
Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on
Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly
train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov
loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of
attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our
formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with
learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging
classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.

Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习中智能体面对未见合作者时的泛化问题，现有自对弈方法局限于内部空间泛化。

Result: 在合作、竞争和社会困境任务中表现出显著的泛化能力，并显著扩展了策略分布空间。

Conclusion: BiDist是一种简洁高效的解决方案，无需复杂的历史策略存储，理论和实验均验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Population-population generalization is a challenging problem in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly when agents encounter unseen
co-players. However, existing self-play-based methods are constrained by the
limitation of inside-space generalization. In this study, we propose
Bidirectional Distillation (BiDist), a novel mixed-play framework, to overcome
this limitation in MARL. BiDist leverages knowledge distillation in two
alternating directions: forward distillation, which emulates the historical
policies' space and creates an implicit self-play, and reverse distillation,
which systematically drives agents towards novel distributions outside the
known policy space in a non-self-play manner. In addition, BiDist operates as a
concise and efficient solution without the need for the complex and costly
storage of past policies. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical
evidence to support BiDist's effectiveness. Our results highlight its
remarkable generalization ability across a variety of cooperative, competitive,
and social dilemma tasks, and reveal that BiDist significantly diversifies the
policy distribution space. We also present comprehensive ablation studies to
reinforce BiDist's effectiveness and key success factors. Source codes are
available in the supplementary material.

Motivation: 抑制变量可能在不依赖目标结果的情况下影响模型预测，导致XAI方法的特征归因出现假阳性，降低了解释的实用性。现有方法主要针对线性模型，对非线性模型和实例解释的扩展有限。

Result: 在XAI-TRIS基准测试中，PatternLocal在超参数优化中表现优于其他XAI方法，显著减少了非线性任务中的假阳性归因。

Conclusion: PatternLocal提供了一种更可靠和可操作的XAI方法，适用于非线性模型和实例解释。

Abstract: Suppressor variables can influence model predictions without being dependent
on the target outcome and they pose a significant challenge for Explainable AI
(XAI) methods. These variables may cause false-positive feature attributions,
undermining the utility of explanations. Although effective remedies exist for
linear models, their extension to non-linear models and to instance-based
explanations has remained limited. We introduce PatternLocal, a novel XAI
technique that addresses this gap. PatternLocal begins with a locally linear
surrogate, e.g. LIME, KernelSHAP, or gradient-based methods, and transforms the
resulting discriminative model weights into a generative representation,
thereby suppressing the influence of suppressor variables while preserving
local fidelity. In extensive hyperparameter optimization on the XAI-TRIS
benchmark, PatternLocal consistently outperformed other XAI methods and reduced
false-positive attributions when explaining non-linear tasks, thereby enabling
more reliable and actionable insights.

Conclusion: Ready2Unlearn为机器学习模型提供了一种主动的遗忘准备策略，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces Ready2Unlearn, a learning-time optimization approach
designed to facilitate future unlearning processes. Unlike the majority of
existing unlearning efforts that focus on designing unlearning algorithms,
which are typically implemented reactively when an unlearning request is made
during the model deployment phase, Ready2Unlearn shifts the focus to the
training phase, adopting a "forward-looking" perspective. Building upon
well-established meta-learning principles, Ready2Unlearn proactively trains
machine learning models with unlearning readiness, such that they are well
prepared and can handle future unlearning requests in a more efficient and
principled manner. Ready2Unlearn is model-agnostic and compatible with any
gradient ascent-based machine unlearning algorithms. We evaluate the method on
both vision and language tasks under various unlearning settings, including
class-wise unlearning and random data unlearning. Experimental results show
that by incorporating such preparedness at training time, Ready2Unlearn
produces an unlearning-ready model state, which offers several key advantages
when future unlearning is required, including reduced unlearning time, improved
retention of overall model capability, and enhanced resistance to the
inadvertent recovery of forgotten data. We hope this work could inspire future
efforts to explore more proactive strategies for equipping machine learning
models with built-in readiness towards more reliable and principled machine
unlearning.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained prominence in offline reinforcement
learning due to their ability to effectively learn high-performing,
generalizable policies from static datasets. Diffusion-based planners
facilitate long-horizon decision-making by generating high-quality trajectories
through iterative denoising, guided by return-maximizing objectives. However,
existing guided sampling strategies such as Classifier Guidance,
Classifier-Free Guidance, and Monte Carlo Sample Selection either produce
suboptimal multi-modal actions, struggle with distributional drift, or incur
prohibitive inference-time costs. To address these challenges, we propose Prior
Guidance (PG), a novel guided sampling framework that replaces the standard
Gaussian prior of a behavior-cloned diffusion model with a learnable
distribution, optimized via a behavior-regularized objective. PG directly
generates high-value trajectories without costly reward optimization of the
diffusion model itself, and eliminates the need to sample multiple candidates
at inference for sample selection. We present an efficient training strategy
that applies behavior regularization in latent space, and empirically
demonstrate that PG outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies and
planners across diverse long-horizon offline RL benchmarks.

Abstract: Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is a promising approach for building
state-of-the-art predictive models on multi-table relational data by
representing it as a heterogeneous temporal graph. However, commonly used Graph
Neural Network models suffer from fundamental limitations in capturing complex
structural patterns and long-range dependencies that are inherent in relational
data. While Graph Transformers have emerged as powerful alternatives to GNNs on
general graphs, applying them to relational entity graphs presents unique
challenges: (i) Traditional positional encodings fail to generalize to massive,
heterogeneous graphs; (ii) existing architectures cannot model the temporal
dynamics and schema constraints of relational data; (iii) existing tokenization
schemes lose critical structural information. Here we introduce the Relational
Graph Transformer (RelGT), the first graph transformer architecture designed
specifically for relational tables. RelGT employs a novel multi-element
tokenization strategy that decomposes each node into five components (features,
type, hop distance, time, and local structure), enabling efficient encoding of
heterogeneity, temporality, and topology without expensive precomputation. Our
architecture combines local attention over sampled subgraphs with global
attention to learnable centroids, incorporating both local and database-wide
representations. Across 21 tasks from the RelBench benchmark, RelGT
consistently matches or outperforms GNN baselines by up to 18%, establishing
Graph Transformers as a powerful architecture for Relational Deep Learning.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly employed in real-world applications
like medicine or economics, thus, potentially affecting large populations.
However, ML models often do not perform homogeneously across such populations
resulting in subgroups of the population (e.g., sex=female AND
marital_status=married) where the model underperforms or, conversely, is
particularly accurate. Identifying and describing such subgroups can support
practical decisions on which subpopulation a model is safe to deploy or where
more training data is required. The potential of identifying and analyzing such
subgroups has been recognized, however, an efficient and coherent framework for
effective search is missing. Consequently, we introduce SubROC, an open-source,
easy-to-use framework based on Exceptional Model Mining for reliably and
efficiently finding strengths and weaknesses of classification models in the
form of interpretable population subgroups. SubROC incorporates common
evaluation measures (ROC and PR AUC), efficient search space pruning for fast
exhaustive subgroup search, control for class imbalance, adjustment for
redundant patterns, and significance testing. We illustrate the practical
benefits of SubROC in case studies as well as in comparative analyses across

Abstract: Normalization layers, such as Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization,
are central components in modern neural networks, widely adopted to improve
training stability and generalization. While their practical effectiveness is
well documented, a detailed theoretical understanding of how normalization
affects model behavior, starting from initialization, remains an important open
question. In this work, we investigate how both the presence and placement of
normalization within hidden layers influence the statistical properties of
network predictions before training begins. In particular, we study how these
choices shape the distribution of class predictions at initialization, which
can range from unbiased (Neutral) to highly concentrated (Prejudiced) toward a
subset of classes. Our analysis shows that normalization placement induces
systematic differences in the initial prediction behavior of neural networks,
which in turn shape the dynamics of learning. By linking architectural choices
to prediction statistics at initialization, our work provides a principled
understanding of how normalization can influence early training behavior and
offers guidance for more controlled and interpretable network design.

Abstract: Recently-developed time series foundation models for scientific machine
learning exhibit emergent abilities to predict physical systems. These
abilities include zero-shot forecasting, in which a model forecasts future
states of a system given only a short trajectory as context. Here, we show that
foundation models applied to physical systems can give accurate predictions,
but that they fail to develop meaningful representations of the underlying
physics. Instead, foundation models often forecast by context parroting, a
simple zero-shot forecasting strategy that copies directly from the context. As
a result, a naive direct context parroting model scores higher than
state-of-the-art time-series foundation models on predicting a diverse range of
dynamical systems, at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. We draw a
parallel between context parroting and induction heads, which explains why
large language models trained on text can be repurposed for time series
forecasting. Our dynamical systems perspective also ties the scaling between
forecast accuracy and context length to the fractal dimension of the attractor,
providing insight into the previously observed in-context neural scaling laws.
Context parroting thus serves as a simple but tough-to-beat baseline for future
time-series foundation models and can help identify in-context learning
strategies beyond parroting.

Abstract: End-to-end learning has become a widely applicable and studied problem in
training predictive ML models to be aware of their impact on downstream
decision-making tasks. These end-to-end models often outperform traditional
methods that separate training from the optimization and only myopically focus
on prediction error. However, the computational complexity of end-to-end
frameworks poses a significant challenge, particularly for large-scale
problems. While training an ML model using gradient descent, each time we need
to compute a gradient we must solve an expensive optimization problem. We
present a meta-optimization method that learns efficient algorithms to
approximate optimization problems, dramatically reducing computational overhead
of solving the decision problem in general, an aspect we leverage in the
training within the end-to-end framework. Our approach introduces a neural
network architecture that near-optimally solves optimization problems while
ensuring feasibility constraints through alternate projections. We prove
exponential convergence, approximation guarantees, and generalization bounds
for our learning method. This method offers superior computational efficiency,
producing high-quality approximations faster and scaling better with problem
size compared to existing techniques. Our approach applies to a wide range of
optimization problems including deterministic, single-stage as well as
two-stage stochastic optimization problems. We illustrate how our proposed
method applies to (1) an electricity generation problem using real data from an
electricity routing company coordinating the movement of electricity throughout
13 states, (2) a shortest path problem with a computer vision task of
predicting edge costs from terrain maps, (3) a two-stage multi-warehouse
cross-fulfillment newsvendor problem, as well as a variety of other

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of Bayesian recovery for solving inverse
problems with general prior, forward operator and noise distributions. We
consider posterior sampling according to an approximate prior $\mathcal{P}$,
and establish sufficient conditions for stable and accurate recovery with high
probability. Our main result is a non-asymptotic bound that shows that the
sample complexity depends on (i) the intrinsic complexity of $\mathcal{P}$,
quantified by its so-called approximate covering number, and (ii) concentration
bounds for the forward operator and noise distributions. As a key application,
we specialize to generative priors, where $\mathcal{P}$ is the pushforward of a
latent distribution via a Deep Neural Network (DNN). We show that the sample
complexity scales log-linearly with the latent dimension $k$, thus establishing
the efficacy of DNN-based priors. Generalizing existing results on
deterministic (i.e., non-Bayesian) recovery for the important problem of random
sampling with an orthogonal matrix $U$, we show how the sample complexity is
determined by the coherence of $U$ with respect to the support of
$\mathcal{P}$. Hence, we establish that coherence plays a fundamental role in
Bayesian recovery as well. Overall, our framework unifies and extends prior
work, providing rigorous guarantees for the sample complexity of solving
Bayesian inverse problems with arbitrary distributions.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of machine-learning models that
operate on graph-structured data. Their expressive power is intimately related
to logics that are invariant under graded bisimilarity. Current proposals for
recurrent GNNs either assume that the graph size is given to the model, or
suffer from a lack of termination guarantees. In this paper, we propose a
halting mechanism for recurrent GNNs. We prove that our halting model can
express all node classifiers definable in graded modal mu-calculus, even for
the standard GNN variant that is oblivious to the graph size. A recent
breakthrough in the study of the expressivity of graded modal mu-calculus in
the finite suggests that conversely, restricted to node classifiers definable
in monadic second-order logic, recurrent GNNs can express only node classifiers
definable in graded modal mu-calculus. To prove our main result, we develop a
new approximate semantics for graded mu-calculus, which we believe to be of
independent interest. We leverage this new semantics into a new model-checking
algorithm, called the counting algorithm, which is oblivious to the graph size.
In a final step we show that the counting algorithm can be implemented on a
halting recurrent GNN.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have re-defined how we model and predict on network
data but there lacks a consensus on choosing the correct underlying graph
structure on which to model signals. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNN) address
this issue by using the sample covariance matrix as a Graph Shift Operator
(GSO). Here, we improve on the performance of VNNs by constructing a Density
Matrix where we consider the sample Covariance matrix as a quasi-Hamiltonian of
the system in the space of random variables. Crucially, using this density
matrix as the GSO allows components of the data to be extracted at different
scales, allowing enhanced discriminability and performance. We show that this
approach allows explicit control of the stability-discriminability trade-off of
the network, provides enhanced robustness to noise compared to VNNs, and
outperforms them in useful real-life applications where the underlying
covariance matrix is informative. In particular, we show that our model can
achieve strong performance in subject-independent Brain Computer Interface EEG
motor imagery classification, outperforming EEGnet while being faster. This
shows how covariance density neural networks provide a basis for the
notoriously difficult task of transferability of BCIs when evaluated on unseen
individuals.

Conclusion: 该方法为无线通信和雷达网络中的其他问题提供了可扩展的去中心化MARL框架。

Abstract: Classic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods require that agents
enjoy global state observability, preventing development of decentralized
algorithms and limiting scalability. Recent work has shown that, under
assumptions on decaying inter-agent influence, global observability can be
replaced by local neighborhood observability at each agent, enabling
decentralization and scalability. Real-world applications enjoying such decay
properties remain underexplored, however, despite the fact that signal power
decay, or signal attenuation, due to path loss is an intrinsic feature of many
problems in wireless communications and radar networks. In this paper, we show
that signal attenuation enables decentralization in MARL by considering the
illustrative special case of performing power allocation for target detection
in a radar network. To achieve this, we propose two new constrained multi-agent
Markov decision process formulations of this power allocation problem, derive
local neighborhood approximations for global value function and gradient
estimates and establish corresponding error bounds, and develop decentralized
saddle point policy gradient algorithms for solving the proposed problems. Our
approach, though oriented towards the specific radar network problem we
consider, provides a useful model for future extensions to additional problems
in wireless communications and radar networks.

Abstract: Recent neural codec language models have made great progress in the field of
text-to-speech (TTS), but controllable emotional TTS still faces many
challenges. Traditional methods rely on predefined discrete emotion labels to
control emotion categories and intensities, which can't capture the complexity
and continuity of human emotional perception and expression. The lack of
large-scale emotional speech datasets with balanced emotion distributions and
fine-grained emotion annotations often causes overfitting in synthesis models
and impedes effective emotion control. To address these issues, we propose
UDDETTS, a neural codec language model unifying discrete and dimensional
emotions for controllable emotional TTS. This model introduces the
interpretable Arousal-Dominance-Valence (ADV) space for dimensional emotion
description and supports emotion control driven by either discrete emotion
labels or nonlinearly quantified ADV values. Furthermore, a semi-supervised
training strategy is designed to comprehensively utilize diverse speech
datasets with different types of emotion annotations to train the UDDETTS.
Experiments show that UDDETTS achieves linear emotion control along the three
dimensions of ADV space, and exhibits superior end-to-end emotional speech
synthesis capabilities.

sensing applications such as human activity recognition and air quality
prediction. Recent efforts in hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS)
automate architecture discovery for specific platforms; however, none focus on
general time-series analysis with edge deployment. Leveraging the
problem-solving and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM), we
propose MONAQ, a novel framework that reformulates NAS into Multi-Objective
Neural Architecture Querying tasks. MONAQ is equipped with multimodal query
generation for processing multimodal time-series inputs and hardware
constraints, alongside an LLM agent-based multi-objective search to achieve
deployment-ready models via code generation. By integrating numerical data,
time-series images, and textual descriptions, MONAQ improves an LLM's
understanding of time-series data. Experiments on fifteen datasets demonstrate
that MONAQ-discovered models outperform both handcrafted models and NAS
baselines while being more efficient.

Relevance: 40.0

TL;DR: 论文提出FRET方法，通过消除特征冗余提升测试时适应（TTA）性能，包括简单版本S-FRET和基于图卷积网络的G-FRET，后者在多种任务中表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决测试数据分布偏移时特征冗余问题，提升模型适应能力，适用于隐私敏感场景。

Method: 提出S-FRET直接优化特征冗余分数，G-FRET结合GCN和对比学习增强特征区分性。

Result: 实验证明G-FRET在多种架构和任务中达到最优性能，提取非冗余且高区分性特征。

Conclusion: G-FRET通过减少冗余和增强区分性，实现了更鲁棒的测试时适应。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to enhance the generalization of deep
learning models when faced with test data that exhibits distribution shifts
from the training data. In this context, only a pre-trained model and unlabeled
test data are available, making it particularly relevant for privacy-sensitive
applications. In practice, we observe that feature redundancy in embeddings
tends to increase as domain shifts intensify in TTA. However, existing TTA
methods often overlook this redundancy, which can hinder the model's
adaptability to new data. To address this issue, we introduce Feature
Redundancy Elimination for Test-time Adaptation (FRET), a novel perspective for
TTA. A straightforward approach (S-FRET) is to directly minimize the feature
redundancy score as an optimization objective to improve adaptation. Despite
its simplicity and effectiveness, S-FRET struggles with label shifts, limiting
its robustness in real-world scenarios. To mitigate this limitation, we further
propose Graph-based FRET (G-FRET), which integrates a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) with contrastive learning. This design not only reduces feature
redundancy but also enhances feature discriminability in both the
representation and prediction layers. Extensive experiments across multiple
model architectures, tasks, and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
S-FRET and show that G-FRET achieves state-of-the-art performance. Further
analysis reveals that G-FRET enables the model to extract non-redundant and
highly discriminative features during inference, thereby facilitating more
robust test-time adaptation.

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和性能上均有显著提升，适用于复杂视觉控制任务。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for visual
policy learning that leverages differentiable simulation and first-order
analytical policy gradients. Our approach decouple the rendering process from
the computation graph, enabling seamless integration with existing
differentiable simulation ecosystems without the need for specialized
differentiable rendering software. This decoupling not only reduces
computational and memory overhead but also effectively attenuates the policy
gradient norm, leading to more stable and smoother optimization. We evaluate
our method on standard visual control benchmarks using modern GPU-accelerated
simulation. Experiments show that our approach significantly reduces wall-clock
training time and consistently outperforms all baseline methods in terms of
final returns. Notably, on complex tasks such as humanoid locomotion, our
method achieves a $4\times$ improvement in final return, and successfully
learns a humanoid running policy within 4 hours on a single GPU.

suitability for real-world applications. Experimental results on four benchmark

previous tasks, validating the reliability and interpretability of the proposed
metric. Our results highlight the potential of CPCF as a robust and effective
tool for assessing and understanding CF in dynamic learning environments.

Abstract: We study the problem of Gaussian bandits with general side information, as
first introduced by Wu, Szepesvari, and Gyorgy. In this setting, the play of an
arm reveals information about other arms, according to an arbitrary a priori
known side information matrix: each element of this matrix encodes the fidelity
of the information that the ``row'' arm reveals about the ``column'' arm. In
the case of Gaussian noise, this model subsumes standard bandits,
full-feedback, and graph-structured feedback as special cases. In this work, we
first construct an LP-based asymptotic instance-dependent lower bound on the
regret. The LP optimizes the cost (regret) required to reliably estimate the
suboptimality gap of each arm. This LP lower bound motivates our main
contribution: the first known asymptotically optimal algorithm for this general
setting.

Abstract: Deep Symbolic Optimization (DSO) is a novel computational framework that
enables symbolic optimization for scientific discovery, particularly in
applications involving the search for intricate symbolic structures. One
notable example is equation discovery, which aims to automatically derive
mathematical models expressed in symbolic form. In DSO, the discovery process
is formulated as a sequential decision-making task. A generative neural network
learns a probabilistic model over a vast space of candidate symbolic
expressions, while reinforcement learning strategies guide the search toward
the most promising regions. This approach integrates gradient-based
optimization with evolutionary and local search techniques, and it incorporates
in-situ constraints, domain-specific priors, and advanced policy optimization
methods. The result is a robust framework capable of efficiently exploring
extensive search spaces to identify interpretable and physically meaningful
models. Extensive evaluations on benchmark problems have demonstrated that DSO
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and interpretability. In
this chapter, we provide a comprehensive overview of the DSO framework and
illustrate its transformative potential for automating symbolic optimization in
scientific discovery.

Abstract: We address the problem of recovering multiple structures of different classes
in a dataset contaminated by noise and outliers. In particular, we consider
geometric structures defined by a mixture of underlying parametric models (e.g.
planes and cylinders, homographies and fundamental matrices), and we tackle the
robust fitting problem by preference analysis and clustering. We present a new
algorithm, termed MultiLink, that simultaneously deals with multiple classes of
models. MultiLink combines on-the-fly model fitting and model selection in a
novel linkage scheme that determines whether two clusters are to be merged. The
resulting method features many practical advantages with respect to methods
based on preference analysis, being faster, less sensitive to the inlier
threshold, and able to compensate limitations deriving from hypotheses
sampling. Experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that Multi-Link
favourably compares with state of the art alternatives, both in multi-class and
single-class problems. Code is publicly made available for download.

Abstract: This paper studies the approximation and generalization abilities of
score-based neural network generative models (SGMs) in estimating an unknown
distribution $P_0$ from $n$ i.i.d. observations in $d$ dimensions. Assuming
merely that $P_0$ is $\alpha$-sub-Gaussian, we prove that for any time step $t
\in [t_0, n^{O(1)}]$, where $t_0 \geq O(\alpha^2n^{-2/d}\log n)$, there exists
a deep ReLU neural network with width $\leq O(\log^3n)$ and depth $\leq
O(n^{3/d}\log_2n)$ that can approximate the scores with $\tilde{O}(n^{-1})$
mean square error and achieve a nearly optimal rate of
$\tilde{O}(n^{-1}t_0^{-d/2})$ for score estimation, as measured by the score
matching loss. Our framework is universal and can be used to establish
convergence rates for SGMs under milder assumptions than previous work. For
example, assuming further that the target density function $p_0$ lies in
Sobolev or Besov classes, with an appropriately early stopping strategy, we
demonstrate that neural network-based SGMs can attain nearly minimax
convergence rates up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis removes several
crucial assumptions, such as Lipschitz continuity of the score function or a
strictly positive lower bound on the target density.

Conclusion: POI-QA是一个有效的时空推理基准，揭示了LLMs在时空推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal relationships are critical in data science, as many prediction
and reasoning tasks require analysis across both spatial and temporal
dimensions--for instance, navigating an unfamiliar city involves planning
itineraries that sequence locations and timing cultural experiences. However,
existing Question-Answering (QA) datasets lack sufficient
spatiotemporal-sensitive questions, making them inadequate benchmarks for
evaluating models' spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce POI-QA, a novel spatiotemporal-sensitive QA dataset centered on
Point of Interest (POI), constructed through three key steps: mining and
aligning open-source vehicle trajectory data from GAIA with high-precision
geographic POI data, rigorous manual validation of noisy spatiotemporal facts,
and generating bilingual (Chinese/English) QA pairs that reflect
human-understandable spatiotemporal reasoning tasks. Our dataset challenges
models to parse complex spatiotemporal dependencies, and evaluations of
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B) reveal stark
limitations: even the top-performing model (Qwen2.5-7B fine-tuned with
RAG+LoRA) achieves a top 10 Hit Ratio (HR@10) of only 0.41 on the easiest task,
far below human performance at 0.56. This underscores persistent weaknesses in
LLMs' ability to perform consistent spatiotemporal reasoning, while
highlighting POI-QA as a robust benchmark to advance algorithms sensitive to
spatiotemporal dynamics. The dataset is publicly available at

Conclusion: PITA通过自监督学习有效解决了自回归模型的误差累积问题，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Auto-regressive partial differential equation (PDE) foundation models have
shown great potential in handling time-dependent data. However, these models
suffer from the shortcut problem deeply rooted in auto-regressive prediction,
causing error accumulation. The challenge becomes particularly evident for
out-of-distribution data, as the pretraining performance may approach random
model initialization for downstream tasks with long-term dynamics. To deal with
this problem, we propose physics-informed temporal alignment (PITA), a
self-supervised learning framework inspired by inverse problem solving.
Specifically, PITA aligns the physical dynamics discovered at different time
steps on each given PDE trajectory by integrating physics-informed constraints
into the self-supervision signal. The alignment is derived from observation
data without relying on known physics priors, indicating strong generalization
ability to the out-of-distribution data. Extensive experiments show that PITA
significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of existing foundation
models on diverse time-dependent PDE data. The code is available at

Abstract: Lifelong learning algorithms enable models to incrementally acquire new
knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. Contrarily, the
field of machine unlearning focuses on explicitly forgetting certain previous
knowledge from pretrained models when requested, in order to comply with data
privacy regulations on the right-to-be-forgotten. Enabling efficient lifelong
learning with the capability to selectively unlearn sensitive information from
models presents a critical and largely unaddressed challenge with contradicting
objectives. We address this problem from the perspective of simultaneously
preventing catastrophic forgetting and allowing forward knowledge transfer
during task-incremental learning, while ensuring exact task unlearning and
minimizing memory requirements, based on a single neural network model to be
adapted. Our proposed solution, privacy-aware lifelong learning (PALL),
involves optimization of task-specific sparse subnetworks with parameter
sharing within a single architecture. We additionally utilize an episodic
memory rehearsal mechanism to facilitate exact unlearning without performance
degradations. We empirically demonstrate the scalability of PALL across various
architectures in image classification, and provide a state-of-the-art solution
that uniquely integrates lifelong learning and privacy-aware unlearning
mechanisms for responsible AI applications.

Diffusion, or SD$^2$, a plug-and-play generative steganography method that
combines bit-position locking with diffusion sampling injection to enable
controllable information embedding within the generative trajectory. SD$^2$
leverages the expressive power of diffusion models to synthesize diverse
carrier images while maintaining full message recovery with $100\%$ accuracy.
Our method achieves a favorable balance between randomness and constraint,
enhancing robustness against steganalysis without compromising image fidelity.
Extensive experiments show that SD$^2$ substantially outperforms prior methods

Abstract: Preferential Bayesian optimization (PBO) is a variant of Bayesian
optimization that observes relative preferences (e.g., pairwise comparisons)
instead of direct objective values, making it especially suitable for
human-in-the-loop scenarios. However, real-world optimization tasks often
involve inequality constraints, which existing PBO methods have not yet
addressed. To fill this gap, we propose constrained preferential Bayesian
optimization (CPBO), an extension of PBO that incorporates inequality
constraints for the first time. Specifically, we present a novel acquisition
function for this purpose. Our technical evaluation shows that our CPBO method
successfully identifies optimal solutions by focusing on exploring feasible
regions. As a practical application, we also present a designer-in-the-loop
system for banner ad design using CPBO, where the objective is the designer's
subjective preference, and the constraint ensures a target predicted
click-through rate. We conducted a user study with professional ad designers,
demonstrating the potential benefits of our approach in guiding creative design
under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) pose critical challenges for intelligent
management due to the diverse user requirements and time-varying wireless
conditions. These factors introduce significant decision complexity, which
limits the adaptability of existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods.
In many DRL algorithms, especially those involving value-based or actor-critic
structures, the critic component plays a key role in guiding policy learning by
estimating value functions. However, conventional critic models often use
shallow architectures that map observations directly to scalar estimates,
limiting their ability to handle multi-task complexity. In contrast, recent
progress in inference-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown
that generating intermediate reasoning steps can significantly improve decision
quality. Motivated by this, we propose ReaCritic, a large reasoning
transformer-based criticmodel scaling scheme that brings reasoning ability into
DRL. ReaCritic performs horizontal reasoning over parallel state-action inputs
and vertical reasoning through deep transformer stacks. It is compatible with a
broad range of value-based and actor-critic DRL algorithms and enhances
generalization in dynamic wireless environments. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ReaCritic improves convergence speed and final performance
across various HetNet settings and standard OpenAI Gym control tasks.

Conclusion: BK的有效利用需要模型设计与BK特性的匹配，但具有显著性能提升潜力。

Abstract: In complex and low-data domains such as biomedical research, incorporating
background knowledge (BK) graphs, such as protein-protein interaction (PPI)
networks, into graph-based machine learning pipelines is a promising research
direction. However, while BK is often assumed to improve model performance, its
actual contribution and the impact of imperfect knowledge remain poorly
understood. In this work, we investigate the role of BK in an important
real-world task: cancer subtype classification. Surprisingly, we find that (i)
state-of-the-art GNNs using BK perform no better than uninformed models like
linear regression, and (ii) their performance remains largely unchanged even
when the BK graph is heavily perturbed. To understand these unexpected results,
we introduce an evaluation framework, which employs (i) a synthetic setting
where the BK is clearly informative and (ii) a set of perturbations that
simulate various imperfections in BK graphs. With this, we test the robustness
of BK-aware models in both synthetic and real-world biomedical settings. Our
findings reveal that careful alignment of GNN architectures and BK
characteristics is necessary but holds the potential for significant
performance improvements.

Abstract: We introduce NeuralSurv, the first deep survival model to incorporate
Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our non-parametric, architecture-agnostic
framework flexibly captures time-varying covariate-risk relationships in
continuous time via a novel two-stage data-augmentation scheme, for which we
establish theoretical guarantees. For efficient posterior inference, we
introduce a mean-field variational algorithm with coordinate-ascent updates
that scale linearly in model size. By locally linearizing the Bayesian neural
network, we obtain full conjugacy and derive all coordinate updates in closed
form. In experiments, NeuralSurv delivers superior calibration compared to
state-of-the-art deep survival models, while matching or exceeding their
discriminative performance across both synthetic benchmarks and real-world

data-scarce regimes by enhancing model calibration and providing robust,
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for the survival function.

Abstract: Kernel-based conditional independence (KCI) testing is a powerful
nonparametric method commonly employed in causal discovery tasks. Despite its
flexibility and statistical reliability, cubic computational complexity limits
its application to large datasets. To address this computational bottleneck, we
propose \textit{FastKCI}, a scalable and parallelizable kernel-based
conditional independence test that utilizes a mixture-of-experts approach
inspired by embarrassingly parallel inference techniques for Gaussian
processes. By partitioning the dataset based on a Gaussian mixture model over
the conditioning variables, FastKCI conducts local KCI tests in parallel,
aggregating the results using an importance-weighted sampling scheme.
Experiments on synthetic datasets and benchmarks on real-world production data
validate that FastKCI maintains the statistical power of the original KCI test
while achieving substantial computational speedups. FastKCI thus represents a
practical and efficient solution for conditional independence testing in causal
inference on large-scale data.

Conclusion: FedDuA在不增加客户端通信或计算成本的情况下，显著提升了联邦学习的收敛速度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed learning framework where clients
collaboratively train a global model without sharing their raw data. FedAvg is
a popular algorithm for federated learning, but it often suffers from slow
convergence due to the heterogeneity of local datasets and anisotropy in the
parameter space. In this work, we formalize the central server optimization
procedure through the lens of mirror descent and propose a novel framework,
called FedDuA, which adaptively selects the global learning rate based on both
inter-client and coordinate-wise heterogeneity in the local updates. We prove
that our proposed doubly adaptive step-size rule is minimax optimal and provide
a convergence analysis for convex objectives. Although the proposed method does
not require additional communication or computational cost on clients,
extensive numerical experiments show that our proposed framework outperforms
baselines in various settings and is robust to the choice of hyperparameters.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated their remarkable
ability to capture complex image distributions, but the geometric properties of
the learned data manifold remain poorly understood. We address this gap by
introducing a score-based Riemannian metric that leverages the Stein score
function from diffusion models to characterize the intrinsic geometry of the
data manifold without requiring explicit parameterization. Our approach defines
a metric tensor in the ambient space that stretches distances perpendicular to
the manifold while preserving them along tangential directions, effectively
creating a geometry where geodesics naturally follow the manifold's contours.
We develop efficient algorithms for computing these geodesics and demonstrate
their utility for both interpolation between data points and extrapolation
beyond the observed data distribution. Through experiments on synthetic data
with known geometry, Rotated MNIST, and complex natural images via Stable
Diffusion, we show that our score-based geodesics capture meaningful
transformations that respect the underlying data distribution. Our method
consistently outperforms baseline approaches on perceptual metrics (LPIPS) and
distribution-level metrics (FID, KID), producing smoother, more realistic image
transitions. These results reveal the implicit geometric structure learned by
diffusion models and provide a principled way to navigate the manifold of
natural images through the lens of Riemannian geometry.

Result: 实验表明，FairAD在检测准确性和公平性之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: FairAD为无监督异常检测中的公平性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is a critical task in many high-social-impact
applications such as finance, healthcare, social media, and cybersecurity,
where demographics involving age, gender, race, disease, etc, are used
frequently. In these scenarios, possible bias from anomaly detection systems
can lead to unfair treatment for different groups and even exacerbate social
bias. In this work, first, we thoroughly analyze the feasibility and necessary
assumptions for ensuring group fairness in unsupervised anomaly detection.
Second, we propose a novel fairness-aware anomaly detection method FairAD. From
the normal training data, FairAD learns a projection to map data of different
demographic groups to a common target distribution that is simple and compact,
and hence provides a reliable base to estimate the density of the data. The
density can be directly used to identify anomalies while the common target
distribution ensures fairness between different groups. Furthermore, we propose
a threshold-free fairness metric that provides a global view for model's
fairness, eliminating dependence on manual threshold selection. Experiments on
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves an improved
trade-off between detection accuracy and fairness under both balanced and
skewed data across different groups.

Abstract: We introduce a generalized attention mechanism for spherical domains,
enabling Transformer architectures to natively process data defined on the
two-dimensional sphere - a critical need in fields such as atmospheric physics,
cosmology, and robotics, where preserving spherical symmetries and topology is
essential for physical accuracy. By integrating numerical quadrature weights
into the attention mechanism, we obtain a geometrically faithful spherical
attention that is approximately rotationally equivariant, providing strong
inductive biases and leading to better performance than Cartesian approaches.
To further enhance both scalability and model performance, we propose
neighborhood attention on the sphere, which confines interactions to geodesic
neighborhoods. This approach reduces computational complexity and introduces
the additional inductive bias for locality, while retaining the symmetry
properties of our method. We provide optimized CUDA kernels and
memory-efficient implementations to ensure practical applicability. The method
is validated on three diverse tasks: simulating shallow water equations on the
rotating sphere, spherical image segmentation, and spherical depth estimation.
Across all tasks, our spherical Transformers consistently outperform their
planar counterparts, highlighting the advantage of geometric priors for
learning on spherical domains.

Conclusion: Set-Sequence模型高效灵活，适用于金融预测问题。

Abstract: In many financial prediction problems, the behavior of individual units (such
as loans, bonds, or stocks) is influenced by observable unit-level factors and
macroeconomic variables, as well as by latent cross-sectional effects.
Traditional approaches attempt to capture these latent effects via handcrafted
summary features. We propose a Set-Sequence model that eliminates the need for
handcrafted features. The Set model first learns a shared cross-sectional
summary at each period. The Sequence model then ingests the summary-augmented
time series for each unit independently to predict its outcome. Both components
are learned jointly over arbitrary sets sampled during training. Our approach
harnesses the set nature of the cross-section and is computationally efficient,
generating set summaries in linear time relative to the number of units. It is
also flexible, allowing the use of existing sequence models and accommodating a
variable number of units at inference. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
our Set-Sequence model significantly outperforms benchmarks on stock return
prediction and mortgage behavior tasks. Code will be released.

Abstract: The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is crucial in
key areas such as healthcare, biomechanics, climate science, and astronomy.
However, achieving accurate and practical predictions is challenging due to two
main factors. First, the inherent irregularity and data missingness in
irregular time series make modeling difficult. Second, most existing methods
are typically complex and resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a
general framework called APN to address these challenges. Specifically, we
design a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that achieves
adaptive patching. By learning dynamically adjustable patch boundaries and a
time-aware weighted averaging strategy, TAPA transforms the original irregular
sequences into high-quality, regularized representations in a
channel-independent manner. Additionally, we use a simple query module to
effectively integrate historical information while maintaining the model's
efficiency. Finally, predictions are made by a shallow MLP. Experimental
results on multiple real-world datasets show that APN outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: FLoST为时空数据重建提供了更高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Tensor completion is crucial in many scientific domains with missing data
problems. Traditional low-rank tensor models, including CP, Tucker, and
Tensor-Train, exploit low-dimensional structures to recover missing data.
However, these methods often treat all tensor modes symmetrically, failing to
capture the unique spatiotemporal patterns inherent in scientific data, where
the temporal component exhibits both low-frequency stability and high-frequency
variations. To address this, we propose a novel model, \underline{F}ourier
\underline{Lo}w-rank and \underline{S}parse \underline{T}ensor (FLoST), which
decomposes the tensor along the temporal dimension using a Fourier transform.
This approach captures low-frequency components with low-rank matrices and
high-frequency fluctuations with sparsity, resulting in a hybrid structure that
efficiently models both smooth and localized variations. Compared to the
well-known tubal-rank model, which assumes low-rankness across all frequency
components, FLoST requires significantly fewer parameters, making it
computationally more efficient, particularly when the time dimension is large.
Through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, we demonstrate that
FLoST outperforms existing tensor completion models in terms of both accuracy
and computational efficiency, offering a more interpretable solution for
spatiotemporal data reconstruction.

Conclusion: 该框架为多类分类提供了更灵活的优化手段，扩展了二分类中的阈值优化优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a threshold-based framework for multiclass
classification that generalizes the standard argmax rule. This is done by
replacing the probabilistic interpretation of softmax outputs with a geometric
one on the multidimensional simplex, where the classification depends on a
multidimensional threshold. This change of perspective enables for any trained
classification network an a posteriori optimization of the classification score
by means of threshold tuning, as usually carried out in the binary setting.
This allows a further refinement of the prediction capability of any network.
Moreover, this multidimensional threshold-based setting makes it possible to
define score-oriented losses, which are based on the interpretation of the
threshold as a random variable. Our experiments show that the multidimensional
threshold tuning yields consistent performance improvements across various
networks and datasets, and that the proposed multiclass score-oriented losses
are competitive with standard loss functions, resembling the advantages
observed in the binary case.

Conclusion: BIF显著提升了H-GP模型的效率和性能，适用于具有层次结构的问题。

Abstract: Hierarchical Gaussian Process (H-GP) models divide problems into different
subtasks, allowing for different models to address each part, making them
well-suited for problems with inherent hierarchical structure. However, typical
H-GP models do not fully take advantage of this structure, only sending
information up or down the hierarchy. This one-way coupling limits sample
efficiency and slows convergence. We propose Bidirectional Information Flow
(BIF), an efficient H-GP framework that establishes bidirectional information
exchange between parent and child models in H-GPs for online training. BIF
retains the modular structure of hierarchical models - the parent combines
subtask knowledge from children GPs - while introducing top-down feedback to
continually refine children models during online learning. This mutual exchange
improves sample efficiency, enables robust training, and allows modular reuse
of learned subtask models. BIF outperforms conventional H-GP Bayesian
Optimization methods, achieving up to 85% and 5x higher $R^2$ scores for the
parent and children respectively, on synthetic and real-world neurostimulation
optimization tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning on structured
data, yet the relationship between their expressivity and predictive
performance remains unclear. We introduce a family of premetrics that capture
different degrees of structural similarity between graphs and relate these
similarities to generalization, and consequently, the performance of expressive
GNNs. By considering a setting where graph labels are correlated with
structural features, we derive generalization bounds that depend on the
distance between training and test graphs, model complexity, and training set
size. These bounds reveal that more expressive GNNs may generalize worse unless
their increased complexity is balanced by a sufficiently large training set or
reduced distance between training and test graphs. Our findings relate
expressivity and generalization, offering theoretical insights supported by
empirical results.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) commonly involves clients with diverse communication
and computational capabilities. Such heterogeneity can significantly distort
the optimization dynamics and lead to objective inconsistency, where the global
model converges to an incorrect stationary point potentially far from the
pursued optimum. Despite its critical impact, the joint effect of communication
and computation heterogeneity has remained largely unexplored, due to the
intrinsic complexity of their interaction. In this paper, we reveal the
fundamentally distinct mechanisms through which heterogeneous communication and
computation drive inconsistency in FL. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first unified theoretical analysis of general heterogeneous FL, offering a
principled understanding of how these two forms of heterogeneity jointly
distort the optimization trajectory under arbitrary choices of local solvers.
Motivated by these insights, we propose Federated Heterogeneity-Aware Client
Sampling, FedACS, a universal method to eliminate all types of objective
inconsistency. We theoretically prove that FedACS converges to the correct
optimum at a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{R})$, even in dynamic heterogeneous
environments. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show that FedACS
outperforms state-of-the-art and category-specific baselines by 4.3%-36%, while
reducing communication costs by 22%-89% and computation loads by 14%-105%,
respectively.

Conclusion: FALDA通过概率学习和傅里叶分解，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: We propose the Fourier Adaptive Lite Diffusion Architecture (FALDA), a novel
probabilistic framework for time series forecasting. First, we introduce the
Diffusion Model for Residual Regression (DMRR) framework, which unifies
diffusion-based probabilistic regression methods. Within this framework, FALDA
leverages Fourier-based decomposition to incorporate a component-specific
architecture, enabling tailored modeling of individual temporal components. A
conditional diffusion model is utilized to estimate the future noise term,
while our proposed lightweight denoiser, DEMA (Decomposition MLP with AdaLN),
conditions on the historical noise term to enhance denoising performance.
Through mathematical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that
FALDA effectively reduces epistemic uncertainty, allowing probabilistic
learning to primarily focus on aleatoric uncertainty. Experiments on six
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that FALDA consistently outperforms existing
probabilistic forecasting approaches across most datasets for long-term time
series forecasting while achieving enhanced computational efficiency without
compromising accuracy. Notably, FALDA also achieves superior overall
performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) point forecasting approaches,
with improvements of up to 9%.

Abstract: Diffusion learning is a framework that endows edge devices with advanced
intelligence. By processing and analyzing data locally and allowing each agent
to communicate with its immediate neighbors, diffusion effectively protects the
privacy of edge devices, enables real-time response, and reduces reliance on
central servers. However, traditional diffusion learning relies on
communication at every iteration, leading to communication overhead, especially
with large learning models. Furthermore, the inherent volatility of edge
devices, stemming from power outages or signal loss, poses challenges to
reliable communication between neighboring agents. To mitigate these issues,
this paper investigates an enhanced diffusion learning approach incorporating
local updates and partial agent participation. Local updates will curtail
communication frequency, while partial agent participation will allow for the
inclusion of agents based on their availability. We prove that the resulting
algorithm is stable in the mean-square error sense and provide a tight analysis
of its Mean-Square-Deviation (MSD) performance. Various numerical experiments
are conducted to illustrate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) describe phenomena ranging from
turbulence and epidemics to quantum mechanics and financial markets. Despite
recent advances in computational science, solving such PDEs for real-world
applications remains prohibitively expensive because of the necessity of
resolving a broad range of spatiotemporal scales. In turn, practitioners often
rely on coarse-grained approximations of the original PDEs, trading off
accuracy for reduced computational resources. To mitigate the loss of detail
inherent in such approximations, closure models are employed to represent
unresolved spatiotemporal interactions. We present a framework for developing
closure models for PDEs using synthetic data acquired through the method of
manufactured solutions. These data are used in conjunction with reinforcement
learning to provide closures for coarse-grained PDEs. We illustrate the
efficacy of our method using the one-dimensional and two-dimensional Burgers'
equations and the two-dimensional advection equation. Moreover, we demonstrate
that closure models trained for inhomogeneous PDEs can be effectively
generalized to homogeneous PDEs. The results demonstrate the potential for
developing accurate and computationally efficient closure models for systems
with scarce data.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness on
graph-based tasks. However, their predictive confidence is often miscalibrated,
typically exhibiting under-confidence, which harms the reliability of their
decisions. Existing calibration methods for GNNs normally introduce additional
calibration components, which fail to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the model and the prediction confidence, resulting in limited
theoretical guarantees and increased computational overhead. To address this
issue, we propose a simple yet efficient graph calibration method. We establish
a unified theoretical framework revealing that model confidence is jointly
governed by class-centroid-level and node-level calibration at the final layer.
Based on this insight, we theoretically show that reducing the weight decay of
the final-layer parameters alleviates GNN under-confidence by acting on the
class-centroid level, while node-level calibration acts as a finer-grained
complement to class-centroid level calibration, which encourages each test node
to be closer to its predicted class centroid at the final-layer
representations. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method.

Abstract: Optimization proxies - machine learning models trained to approximate the
solution mapping of parametric optimization problems in a single forward pass -
offer dramatic reductions in inference time compared to traditional iterative
solvers. This work investigates the integration of solver sensitivities into
such end to end proxies via a Sobolev training paradigm and does so in two
distinct settings: (i) fully supervised proxies, where exact solver outputs and
sensitivities are available, and (ii) self supervised proxies that rely only on
the objective and constraint structure of the underlying optimization problem.
By augmenting the standard training loss with directional derivative
information extracted from the solver, the proxy aligns both its predicted
solutions and local derivatives with those of the optimizer. Under Lipschitz
continuity assumptions on the true solution mapping, matching first order
sensitivities is shown to yield uniform approximation error proportional to the
training set covering radius. Empirically, different impacts are observed in
each studied setting. On three large Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow
benchmarks, supervised Sobolev training cuts mean squared error by up to 56
percent and the median worst case constraint violation by up to 400 percent
while keeping the optimality gap below 0.22 percent. For a mean variance
portfolio task trained without labeled solutions, self supervised Sobolev
training halves the average optimality gap in the medium risk region (standard
deviation above 10 percent of budget) and matches the baseline elsewhere.
Together, these results highlight Sobolev training whether supervised or self
supervised as a path to fast reliable surrogates for safety critical large
scale optimization workloads.

Motivation: 传统DNN训练通过梯度下降隐式学习NTK，但显式优化NTK可能在某些场景下表现更优，挑战DNN的传统优势。

Result: 实验显示显式训练的NTK性能优于原始DNN及其诱导的NTK。

Conclusion: 显式训练NTK是一种过参数化特征学习形式，可能在某些场景下超越传统DNN优化。

Abstract: The performance of the data-dependent neural tangent kernel (NTK; Jacot et
al. (2018)) associated with a trained deep neural network (DNN) often matches
or exceeds that of the full network. This implies that DNN training via
gradient descent implicitly performs kernel learning by optimizing the NTK. In
this paper, we propose instead to optimize the NTK explicitly. Rather than
minimizing empirical risk, we train the NTK to minimize its generalization
error using the recently developed Kernel Alignment Risk Estimator (KARE; Jacot
et al. (2020)). Our simulations and real data experiments show that NTKs
trained with KARE consistently match or significantly outperform the original
DNN and the DNN- induced NTK (the after-kernel). These results suggest that
explicitly trained kernels can outperform traditional end-to-end DNN
optimization in certain settings, challenging the conventional dominance of
DNNs. We argue that explicit training of NTK is a form of over-parametrized
feature learning.

Conclusion: FractalGCL通过分形理论显著提升了图对比学习的性能与效率。

Abstract: While Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has attracted considerable attention
in the field of graph self-supervised learning, its performance heavily relies
on data augmentations that are expected to generate semantically consistent
positive pairs. Existing strategies typically resort to random perturbations or
local structure preservation, yet lack explicit control over global structural
consistency between augmented views. To address this limitation, we propose
Fractal Graph Contrastive Learning (FractalGCL), a theory-driven framework that
leverages fractal self-similarity to enforce global topological coherence.
FractalGCL introduces two key innovations: a renormalisation-based augmentation
that generates structurally aligned positive views via box coverings; and a
fractal-dimension-aware contrastive loss that aligns graph embeddings according
to their fractal dimensions. While combining the two innovations markedly
boosts graph-representation quality, it also adds non-trivial computational
overhead. To mitigate the computational overhead of fractal dimension
estimation, we derive a one-shot estimator by proving that the dimension
discrepancy between original and renormalised graphs converges weakly to a
centred Gaussian distribution. This theoretical insight enables a reduction in
dimension computation cost by an order of magnitude, cutting overall training
time by approximately 61%. The experiments show that FractalGCL not only
delivers state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks but also outperforms
traditional baselines on traffic networks by an average margin of about
remarkably 7%. Codes are available at

Abstract: One explanation for the strong generalization ability of neural networks is
implicit bias. Yet, the definition and mechanism of implicit bias in non-linear
contexts remains little understood. In this work, we propose to characterize
implicit bias by the count of connected regions in the input space with the
same predicted label. Compared with parameter-dependent metrics (e.g., norm or
normalized margin), region count can be better adapted to nonlinear,
overparameterized models, because it is determined by the function mapping and
is invariant to reparametrization. Empirically, we found that small region
counts align with geometrically simple decision boundaries and correlate well
with good generalization performance. We also observe that good hyper-parameter
choices such as larger learning rates and smaller batch sizes can induce small
region counts. We further establish the theoretical connections and explain how
larger learning rate can induce small region counts in neural networks.

Abstract: When the distribution of the data used to train a classifier differs from
that of the test data, i.e., under dataset shift, well-established routines for
calibrating the decision scores of the classifier, estimating the proportion of
positives in a test sample, or estimating the accuracy of the classifier,
become particularly challenging. This paper investigates the interconnections
among three fundamental problems, calibration, quantification, and classifier
accuracy prediction, under dataset shift conditions. Specifically, we prove
their equivalence through mutual reduction, i.e., we show that access to an
oracle for any one of these tasks enables the resolution of the other two.
Based on these proofs, we propose new methods for each problem based on direct
adaptations of well-established methods borrowed from the other disciplines.
Our results show such methods are often competitive, and sometimes even surpass
the performance of dedicated approaches from each discipline. The main goal of
this paper is to fostering cross-fertilization among these research areas,
encouraging the development of unified approaches and promoting synergies
across the fields.

Abstract: Accurate electricity load forecasting is essential for grid stability,
resource optimization, and renewable energy integration. While
transformer-based deep learning models like TimeGPT have gained traction in
time-series forecasting, their effectiveness in long-term electricity load
prediction remains uncertain. This study evaluates forecasting models ranging
from classical regression techniques to advanced deep learning architectures
using data from the ESD 2025 competition. The dataset includes two years of
historical electricity load data, alongside temperature and global horizontal
irradiance (GHI) across five sites, with a one-day-ahead forecasting horizon.
Since actual test set load values remain undisclosed, leveraging predicted
values would accumulate errors, making this a long-term forecasting challenge.
We employ (i) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
and (ii) frame the task as a regression problem, using temperature and GHI as
covariates to predict load for each hour, (iii) ultimately stacking 24 models
to generate yearly forecasts.
  Our results reveal that deep learning models, including TimeGPT, fail to
consistently outperform simpler statistical and machine learning approaches due
to the limited availability of training data and exogenous variables. In
contrast, XGBoost, with minimal feature engineering, delivers the lowest error
rates across all test cases while maintaining computational efficiency. This
highlights the limitations of deep learning in long-term electricity
forecasting and reinforces the importance of model selection based on dataset
characteristics rather than complexity. Our study provides insights into
practical forecasting applications and contributes to the ongoing discussion on
the trade-offs between traditional and modern forecasting methods.

Abstract: Counterfactual learning is emerging as an important paradigm, rooted in
causality, which promises to alleviate common issues of graph neural networks
(GNNs), such as fairness and interpretability. However, as in many real-world
application domains where conducting randomized controlled trials is
impractical, one has to rely on available observational (factual) data to
detect counterfactuals. In this paper, we introduce and tackle the problem of
searching for counterfactual evidences for the GNN-based node classification
task. A counterfactual evidence is a pair of nodes such that, regardless they
exhibit great similarity both in the features and in their neighborhood
subgraph structures, they are classified differently by the GNN. We develop
effective and efficient search algorithms and a novel indexing solution that
leverages both node features and structural information to identify
counterfactual evidences, and generalizes beyond any specific GNN. Through
various downstream applications, we demonstrate the potential of counterfactual
evidences to enhance fairness and accuracy of GNNs.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals encode information about relative changes
in blood volume that can be used to assess various aspects of cardiac health
non-invasively, e.g.\ to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) or predict blood
pressure (BP). Deep networks are well-equipped to handle the large quantities
of data acquired from wearable measurement devices. However, they lack
interpretability and are prone to overfitting, leaving considerable risk for
poor performance on unseen data and misdiagnosis. Here, we describe the use of
two scalable uncertainty quantification techniques: Monte Carlo Dropout and the
recently proposed Improved Variational Online Newton. These techniques are used
to assess the trustworthiness of models trained to perform AF classification
and BP regression from raw PPG time series. We find that the choice of
hyperparameters has a considerable effect on the predictive performance of the
models and on the quality and composition of predicted uncertainties. E.g. the
stochasticity of the model parameter sampling determines the proportion of the
total uncertainty that is aleatoric, and has varying effects on predictive
performance and calibration quality dependent on the chosen uncertainty
quantification technique and the chosen expression of uncertainty. We find
significant discrepancy in the quality of uncertainties over the predicted
classes, emphasising the need for a thorough evaluation protocol that assesses
local and adaptive calibration. This work suggests that the choice of
hyperparameters must be carefully tuned to balance predictive performance and
calibration quality, and that the optimal parameterisation may vary depending
on the chosen expression of uncertainty.

Abstract: Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data is a
central challenge in causal inference, largely due to covariate imbalance and
confounding bias from non-randomized treatment assignment. While inverse
probability weighting (IPW) is a well-established solution to this problem, its
integration into modern deep learning frameworks remains limited. In this work,
we propose Importance-Weighted Diffusion Distillation (IWDD), a novel
generative framework that combines the pretraining of diffusion models with
importance-weighted score distillation to enable accurate and fast causal
estimation-including potential outcome prediction and treatment effect
estimation. We demonstrate how IPW can be naturally incorporated into the
distillation of pretrained diffusion models, and further introduce a
randomization-based adjustment that eliminates the need to compute IPW
explicitly-thereby simplifying computation and, more importantly, provably
reducing the variance of gradient estimates. Empirical results show that IWDD
achieves state-of-the-art out-of-sample prediction performance, with the
highest win rates compared to other baselines, significantly improving causal
estimation and supporting the development of individualized treatment
strategies. We will release our PyTorch code for reproducibility and future
research.

Conclusion: msf-CNN为系统设计者提供了更大的灵活性，适用于资源受限的MCU环境。

Abstract: AI spans from large language models to tiny models running on
microcontrollers (MCUs). Extremely memory-efficient model architectures are
decisive to fit within an MCU's tiny memory budget e.g., 128kB of RAM. However,
inference latency must remain small to fit real-time constraints. An approach
to tackle this is patch-based fusion, which aims to optimize data flows across
neural network layers. In this paper, we introduce msf-CNN, a novel technique
that efficiently finds optimal fusion settings for convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) by walking through the fusion solution space represented as a
directed acyclic graph. Compared to previous work on CNN fusion for MCUs,
msf-CNN identifies a wider set of solutions. We published an implementation of
msf-CNN running on various microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP32). We
show that msf-CNN can achieve inference using 50% less RAM compared to the
prior art (MCUNetV2 and StreamNet). We thus demonstrate how msf-CNN offers

Conclusion: 该方法在保持跟踪误差和控制努力的同时，显著提升了系统动态识别的性能。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly used in control applications due
to their powerful function approximation capabilities. However, many existing
formulations focus primarily on tracking error convergence, often neglecting
the challenge of identifying the system dynamics using the DNN. This paper
presents the first result on simultaneous trajectory tracking and online system
identification using a DNN-based controller, without requiring persistent
excitation. Two new concurrent learning adaptation laws are constructed for the
weights of all the layers of the DNN, achieving convergence of the DNN's
parameter estimates to a neighborhood of their ideal values, provided the DNN's
Jacobian satisfies a finite-time excitation condition. A Lyapunov-based
stability analysis is conducted to ensure convergence of the tracking error,
weight estimation errors, and observer errors to a neighborhood of the origin.
Simulations performed on a range of systems and trajectories, with the same
initial and operating conditions, demonstrated 40.5% to 73.6% improvement in
function approximation performance compared to the baseline, while maintaining
a similar tracking error and control effort. Simulations evaluating function
approximation capabilities on data points outside of the trajectory resulted in
58.88% and 74.75% improvement in function approximation compared to the
baseline.

TL;DR: DRArmor是一种针对联邦学习中数据重构攻击（DRA）的新型防御机制，通过可解释AI和针对性检测与缓解策略保护用户数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）易受数据重构攻击（如LoKI和Robbing the Fed）威胁，需要一种高效防御机制。

Method: DRArmor通过分析恶意层对输出的贡献和梯度不一致性，识别并针对性防御（如噪声注入、像素化和剪枝），而非全模型防御。

Result: 在200客户端的FL设置中，DRArmor对LoKI攻击有效，真阳性率0.910，真阴性率0.890，平均准确率87%，数据泄漏率降低62.5%。

Conclusion: DRArmor在保护隐私的同时保持模型性能，优于现有防御机制。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative
model training while keeping client data decentralized and private. However, it
is vulnerable to Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA) such as "LoKI" and "Robbing
the Fed", where malicious models sent from the server to the client can
reconstruct sensitive user data. To counter this, we introduce DRArmor, a novel
defense mechanism that integrates Explainable AI with targeted detection and
mitigation strategies for DRA. Unlike existing defenses that focus on the
entire model, DRArmor identifies and addresses the root cause (i.e., malicious
layers within the model that send gradients with malicious intent) by analyzing
their contribution to the output and detecting inconsistencies in gradient
values. Once these malicious layers are identified, DRArmor applies defense
techniques such as noise injection, pixelation, and pruning to these layers
rather than the whole model, minimizing the attack surface and preserving
client data privacy. We evaluate DRArmor's performance against the advanced
LoKI attack across diverse datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
ImageNet, in a 200-client FL setup. Our results demonstrate DRArmor's
effectiveness in mitigating data leakage, achieving high True Positive and True
Negative Rates of 0.910 and 0.890, respectively. Additionally, DRArmor
maintains an average accuracy of 87%, effectively protecting client privacy
without compromising model performance. Compared to existing defense
mechanisms, DRArmor reduces the data leakage rate by 62.5% with datasets
containing 500 samples per client.

Abstract: Sparse linear regression is a fundamental tool in data analysis. However,
traditional approaches often fall short when covariates exhibit structure or
arise from heterogeneous sources. In biomedical applications, covariates may
stem from distinct modalities or be structured according to an underlying
graph. We introduce Neural Adaptive Shrinkage (Nash), a unified framework that
integrates covariate-specific side information into sparse regression via
neural networks. Nash adaptively modulates penalties on a per-covariate basis,
learning to tailor regularization without cross-validation. We develop a
variational inference algorithm for efficient training and establish
connections to empirical Bayes regression. Experiments on real data demonstrate
that Nash can improve accuracy and adaptability over existing methods.

Conclusion: CDGLT为高效准确的多模态隐喻理解提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Metaphorical imagination, the ability to connect seemingly unrelated
concepts, is fundamental to human cognition and communication. While
understanding linguistic metaphors has advanced significantly, grasping
multimodal metaphors, such as those found in internet memes, presents unique
challenges due to their unconventional expressions and implied meanings.
Existing methods for multimodal metaphor identification often struggle to
bridge the gap between literal and figurative interpretations. Additionally,
generative approaches that utilize large language models or text-to-image
models, while promising, suffer from high computational costs. This paper
introduces \textbf{C}oncept \textbf{D}rift \textbf{G}uided \textbf{L}ayerNorm
\textbf{T}uning (\textbf{CDGLT}), a novel and training-efficient framework for
multimodal metaphor identification. CDGLT incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Concept Drift, a mechanism that leverages Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP) of cross-modal embeddings from a CLIP encoder to generate a new,
divergent concept embedding. This drifted concept helps to alleviate the gap
between literal features and the figurative task. (2) A prompt construction
strategy, that adapts the method of feature extraction and fusion using
pre-trained language models for the multimodal metaphor identification task.
CDGLT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MET-Meme benchmark while
significantly reducing training costs compared to existing generative methods.
Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of both Concept Drift and our
adapted LN Tuning approach. Our method represents a significant step towards
efficient and accurate multimodal metaphor understanding. The code is

Result: 在合成和真实高维基准测试中表现优于传统REMBO和其他低秩BO方法。

Conclusion: SA-REMBO为复杂结构化设计空间中的可扩展贝叶斯优化提供了灵活且强大的扩展。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) in high-dimensional spaces remains fundamentally
limited by the curse of dimensionality and the rigidity of global
low-dimensional assumptions. While Random EMbedding Bayesian Optimization
(REMBO) mitigates this via linear projections into low-dimensional subspaces,
it typically assumes a single global embedding and a stationary objective. In
this work, we introduce Self-Adaptive embedding REMBO (SA-REMBO), a novel
framework that generalizes REMBO to support multiple random Gaussian
embeddings, each capturing a different local subspace structure of the
high-dimensional objective. An index variable governs the embedding choice and
is jointly modeled with the latent optimization variable via a product kernel
in a Gaussian Process surrogate. This enables the optimizer to adaptively
select embeddings conditioned on location, effectively capturing locally
varying effective dimensionality, nonstationarity, and heteroscedasticity in
the objective landscape. We theoretically analyze the expressiveness and
stability of the index-conditioned product kernel and empirically demonstrate
the advantage of our method across synthetic and real-world high-dimensional
benchmarks, where traditional REMBO and other low-rank BO methods fail. Our
results establish SA-REMBO as a powerful and flexible extension for scalable BO
in complex, structured design spaces.

Motivation: 权重衰减在CF模型训练中的重要性未被充分理解，但其调优对模型性能至关重要。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析揭示权重衰减的作用，并提出PRISM方法预编码流行度信息。

Result: PRISM将性能提升4.77%，训练时间减少38.48%，并能有效缓解流行度偏差。

Conclusion: PRISM是一种简单有效的方法，可替代权重衰减，提升CF模型的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Collaborative filtering (CF) enables large-scale recommendation systems by
encoding information from historical user-item interactions into dense
ID-embedding tables. However, as embedding tables grow, closed-form solutions
become impractical, often necessitating the use of mini-batch gradient descent
for training. Despite extensive work on designing loss functions to train CF
models, we argue that one core component of these pipelines is heavily
overlooked: weight decay. Attaining high-performing models typically requires
careful tuning of weight decay, regardless of loss, yet its necessity is not
well understood. In this work, we question why weight decay is crucial in CF
pipelines and how it impacts training. Through theoretical and empirical
analysis, we surprisingly uncover that weight decay's primary function is to
encode popularity information into the magnitudes of the embedding vectors.
Moreover, we find that tuning weight decay acts as a coarse, non-linear knob to
influence preference towards popular or unpopular items. Based on these
findings, we propose PRISM (Popularity-awaRe Initialization Strategy for
embedding Magnitudes), a straightforward yet effective solution to simplify the
training of high-performing CF models. PRISM pre-encodes the popularity
information typically learned through weight decay, eliminating its necessity.
Our experiments show that PRISM improves performance by up to 4.77% and reduces
training times by 38.48%, compared to state-of-the-art training strategies.
Additionally, we parameterize PRISM to modulate the initialization strength,
offering a cost-effective and meaningful strategy to mitigate popularity bias.

Result: 在大规模数据上实现了高效且准确的深度GP训练。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了深度GP在大规模数据上的训练效率和准确性。

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) have gained popularity as flexible machine learning
models for regression and function approximation with an in-built method for
uncertainty quantification. However, GPs suffer when the amount of training
data is large or when the underlying function contains multi-scale features
that are difficult to represent by a stationary kernel. To address the former,
training of GPs with large-scale data is often performed through inducing point
approximations (also known as sparse GP regression (GPR)), where the size of
the covariance matrices in GPR is reduced considerably through a greedy search
on the data set. To aid the latter, deep GPs have gained traction as
hierarchical models that resolve multi-scale features by combining multiple
GPs. Posterior inference in deep GPs requires a sampling or, more usual, a
variational approximation. Variational approximations lead to large-scale
stochastic, non-convex optimisation problems and the resulting approximation
tends to represent uncertainty incorrectly. In this work, we combine
variational learning with MCMC to develop a particle-based
expectation-maximisation method to simultaneously find inducing points within
the large-scale data (variationally) and accurately train the GPs
(sampling-based). The result is a highly efficient and accurate methodology for
deep GP training on large-scale data. We test our method on standard benchmark
problems.

Abstract: Current invasive assistive technologies are designed to infer
high-dimensional motor control signals from severely paralyzed patients.
However, they face significant challenges, including public acceptance, limited
longevity, and barriers to commercialization. Meanwhile, noninvasive
alternatives often rely on artifact-prone signals, require lengthy user
training, and struggle to deliver robust high-dimensional control for dexterous
tasks. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel human-centered
multimodal AI approach as intelligent compensatory mechanisms for lost motor
functions that could potentially enable patients with severe paralysis to
control high-dimensional assistive devices, such as dexterous robotic arms,
using limited and noninvasive inputs. In contrast to the current
state-of-the-art (SoTA) noninvasive approaches, our context-aware, multimodal
shared-autonomy framework integrates deep reinforcement learning algorithms to
blend limited low-dimensional user input with real-time environmental
perception, enabling adaptive, dynamic, and intelligent interpretation of human

of the proposed closed-loop human-in-the-loop paradigm, outperforming the SoTA
shared autonomy algorithms. Following a zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, ARAS

intent detection and smooth, stable 3D trajectory control for dexterous
pick-and-place tasks. ARAS user study achieved a high task success rate of

Abstract: Due to the rapid growth in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) networks,
the cyber risk has increased exponentially, and therefore, we have to develop
effective IDS that can work well with highly imbalanced datasets. A high rate
of missed threats can be the result, as traditional machine learning models
tend to struggle in identifying attacks when normal data volume is much higher
than the volume of attacks. For example, the dataset used in this study reveals
a strong class imbalance with 94,659 instances of the majority class and only
28 instances of the minority class, making it quite challenging to determine
rare attacks accurately. The challenges presented in this research are
addressed by hybrid sampling techniques designed to improve data imbalance
detection accuracy in IoT domains. After applying these techniques, we evaluate
the performance of several machine learning models such as Random Forest, Soft
Voting, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP), and Logistic Regression with respect to the classification of
cyber-attacks. The obtained results indicate that the Random Forest model
achieved the best performance with a Kappa score of 0.9903, test accuracy of
0.9961, and AUC of 0.9994. Strong performance is also shown by the Soft Voting
model, with an accuracy of 0.9952 and AUC of 0.9997, indicating the benefits of
combining model predictions. Overall, this work demonstrates the value of
hybrid sampling combined with robust model and feature selection for
significantly improving IoT security against cyber-attacks, especially in

Abstract: The rapid decline of Arctic sea ice resulting from anthropogenic climate

precise seasonal sea ice forecasts. While dynamical models perform well for
short-term forecasts, they encounter limitations in long-term forecasts and are
computationally intensive. Deep learning models, while more computationally

when dealing with complex sea ice dynamics. In this research, we introduce
IceMamba, a deep learning architecture that integrates sophisticated attention
mechanisms within the state space model. Through comparative analysis of 25
renowned forecast models, including dynamical, statistical, and deep learning

seasonal forecasting capabilities for Pan-Arctic sea ice concentration.
Specifically, IceMamba outperforms all tested models regarding average RMSE and

Abstract: Clustering tabular data remains a significant open challenge in data analysis
and machine learning. Unlike for image data, similarity between tabular records
often varies across datasets, making the definition of clusters highly
dataset-dependent. Furthermore, the absence of supervised signals complicates
hyperparameter tuning in deep learning clustering methods, frequently resulting
in unstable performance. To address these issues and reduce the need for
per-dataset tuning, we adopt an emerging approach in deep learning: zero-shot
learning. We propose ZEUS, a self-contained model capable of clustering new
datasets without any additional training or fine-tuning. It operates by
decomposing complex datasets into meaningful components that can then be
clustered effectively. Thanks to pre-training on synthetic datasets generated
from a latent-variable prior, it generalizes across various datasets without
requiring user intervention. To the best of our knowledge, ZEUS is the first
zero-shot method capable of generating embeddings for tabular data in a fully
unsupervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that it performs on par
with or better than traditional clustering algorithms and recent deep
learning-based methods, while being significantly faster and more
user-friendly.

features from the PCAWG, PID, and COSMIC-CGC repositories.
  Our design enables fair comparisons among diverse GNN architectures including
GAT, GAT3H, GCN, GCN2, GIN, GTN, HGCN, PHGCN, and GraphSAGE and a baseline
Logistic Regression (LR) model. All GNNs were configured as standardised
two-layer models and trained with uniform hyperparameters (dropout = 0.2; Adam
optimiser with learning rate = 0.01; and an adjusted binary cross-entropy loss
to address class imbalance) over an 80/20 train-test split for 300 epochs. Each
model was evaluated over 10 independent runs with different random seeds to
yield statistically robust performance metrics, with balanced accuracy (BACC)
as the primary measure. Notably, GCN2 achieved the highest BACC (0.807 +/-
0.035) on a STRING-based network, although all GNN types outperformed the LR
baseline, highlighting the advantage of network-based learning over
feature-only approaches.
  Our results show that a common framework for implementing and evaluating GNN
architectures aids in identifying not only the best model but also the most
effective means of incorporating complementary data. By making GNN-Suite
publicly available, we aim to foster reproducible research and promote improved
benchmarking standards in computational biology. Future work will explore

Abstract: Healthcare data frequently contain a substantial proportion of missing
values, necessitating effective time series imputation to support downstream
disease diagnosis tasks. However, existing imputation methods focus on discrete
data points and are unable to effectively model sparse data, resulting in
particularly poor performance for imputing substantial missing values. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach, ImputeINR, for time series imputation by
employing implicit neural representations (INR) to learn continuous functions
for time series. ImputeINR leverages the merits of INR in that the continuous
functions are not coupled to sampling frequency and have infinite sampling
frequency, allowing ImputeINR to generate fine-grained imputations even on
extremely sparse observed values. Extensive experiments conducted on eight
datasets with five ratios of masked values show the superior imputation
performance of ImputeINR, especially for high missing ratios in time series
data. Furthermore, we validate that applying ImputeINR to impute missing values
in healthcare data enhances the performance of downstream disease diagnosis
tasks. Codes are available.

Abstract: We focus on the problem of identifying samples in a set that do not conform

way to solve this problem is to embed data in a high dimensional space, called
Preference Space, where anomalies can be identified as the most isolated
points. In this work, we employ Locality Sensitive Hashing to avoid explicit
computation of distances in high dimensions and thus improve Anomaly Detection
efficiency. Specifically, we present an isolation-based anomaly detection

general solution, $ii$) RuzHash-iForest, that avoids explicit computation of
distances via Local Sensitive Hashing, and $iii$) Sliding-PIF, that leverages a
locality prior to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Predicting the labels of graph-structured data is crucial in scientific
applications and is often achieved using graph neural networks (GNNs). However,
when data is scarce, GNNs suffer from overfitting, leading to poor performance.
Recently, Gaussian processes (GPs) with graph-level inputs have been proposed
as an alternative. In this work, we extend the Gaussian process framework to
simplicial complexes (SCs), enabling the handling of edge-level attributes and
attributes supported on higher-order simplices. We further augment the
resulting SC representations by considering their Hodge decompositions,
allowing us to account for homological information, such as the number of
holes, in the SC. We demonstrate that our framework enhances the predictions
across various applications, paving the way for GPs to be more widely used for
graph and SC-level predictions.

Motivation: 传统PCA方法在高维空间中计算成本高，而子空间跟踪算法如Oja算法虽高效但通常需要全维度观测。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用压缩采样变体的Oja算法，每次迭代仅采集两个压缩测量：一个沿当前估计方向，一个沿随机正交方向。

Conclusion: 该工作首次为噪声环境下的自适应感知子空间跟踪提供了收敛保证，适用于全维度采样困难或昂贵的场景。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of efficient principal component analysis
(PCA) in high-dimensional spaces by analyzing a compressively sampled variant
of Oja's algorithm with adaptive sensing. Traditional PCA methods incur
substantial computational costs that scale poorly with data dimensionality,
whereas subspace tracking algorithms like Oja's offer more efficient
alternatives but typically require full-dimensional observations. We analyze a
variant where, at each iteration, only two compressed measurements are taken:
one in the direction of the current estimate and one in a random orthogonal
direction. We prove that this adaptive sensing approach achieves global
convergence in the presence of noise when tracking the leading eigenvector of a
datastream with eigengap $\Delta=\lambda_1-\lambda_2$. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that the algorithm experiences two phases: (1) a warmup phase
requiring $O(\lambda_1\lambda_2d^2/\Delta^2)$ iterations to achieve a
constant-level alignment with the true eigenvector, followed by (2) a local
convergence phase where the sine alignment error decays at a rate of
$O(\lambda_1\lambda_2d^2/\Delta^2 t)$ for iterations $t$. The guarantee aligns
with existing minimax lower bounds with an added factor of $d$ due to the
compressive sampling. This work provides the first convergence guarantees in
adaptive sensing for subspace tracking with noise. Our proof technique is also
considerably simpler than those in prior works. The results have important
implications for applications where acquiring full-dimensional samples is
challenging or costly.

Result: FP32导致优化过早收敛，FP64成功解决了PDE问题。

Conclusion: 算术精度是PINNs可靠解决PDE的关键因素。

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) often exhibit failure modes in which
the PDE residual loss converges while the solution error stays large, a
phenomenon traditionally blamed on local optima separated from the true
solution by steep loss barriers. We challenge this understanding by demonstrate
that the real culprit is insufficient arithmetic precision: with standard FP32,
the LBFGS optimizer prematurely satisfies its convergence test, freezing the
network in a spurious failure phase. Simply upgrading to FP64 rescues
optimization, enabling vanilla PINNs to solve PDEs without any failure modes.
These results reframe PINN failure modes as precision induced stalls rather
than inescapable local minima and expose a three stage training dynamic
unconverged, failure, success whose boundaries shift with numerical precision.
Our findings emphasize that rigorous arithmetic precision is the key to
dependable PDE solving with neural networks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has attracted significant attention for enabling
collaborative learning without exposing private data. Among the primary
variants of FL, vertical federated learning (VFL) addresses feature-partitioned
data held by multiple institutions, each holding complementary information for
the same set of users. However, existing VFL methods often impose restrictive
assumptions such as a small number of participating parties, fully aligned
data, or only using labeled data. In this work, we reinterpret alignment gaps
in VFL as missing data problems and propose a unified framework that
accommodates both training and inference under arbitrary alignment and labeling
scenarios, while supporting diverse missingness mechanisms. In the experiments
on 168 configurations spanning four benchmark datasets, six training-time
missingness patterns, and seven testing-time missingness patterns, our method
outperforms all baselines in 160 cases with an average gap of 9.6 percentage
points over the next-best competitors. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first VFL framework to jointly handle arbitrary data alignment, unlabeled

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing is a next-generation computing paradigm that
promises fast, parallel, and energy-efficient deep learning training and
transfer learning (TL). However, achieving this promise has remained elusive
due to a lack of suitable training algorithms. Analog memory devices exhibit
asymmetric and non-linear switching behavior in addition to device-to-device
variation, meaning that most, if not all, of the current off-the-shelf training
algorithms cannot achieve good training outcomes. Also, recently introduced
algorithms have enjoyed limited attention, as they require bi-directionally
switching devices of unrealistically high symmetry and precision and are highly
sensitive. A new algorithm chopped TTv2 (c-TTv2), has been introduced, which
leverages the chopped technique to address many of the challenges mentioned
above. In this paper, we assess the performance of the c-TTv2 algorithm for
analog TL using a Swin-ViT model on a subset of the CIFAR100 dataset. We also
investigate the robustness of our algorithm to changes in some device
specifications, including weight transfer noise, symmetry point skew, and
symmetry point variability

Abstract: Deep learning methods have shown promising performance in fault diagnosis for
multimode process. Most existing studies assume that the collected health state
categories from different operating modes are identical. However, in real
industrial scenarios, these categories typically exhibit only partial overlap.
The incompleteness of the available data and the large distributional
differences between the operating modes pose a significant challenge to
existing fault diagnosis methods. To address this problem, a novel fault
diagnosis model named self-adaptive temporal-spatial attention network
(TSA-SAN) is proposed. First, inter-mode mappings are constructed using healthy
category data to generate multimode samples. To enrich the diversity of the
fault data, interpolation is performed between healthy and fault samples.
Subsequently, the fault diagnosis model is trained using real and generated
data. The self-adaptive instance normalization is established to suppress
irrelevant information while retaining essential statistical features for
diagnosis. In addition, a temporal-spatial attention mechanism is constructed
to focus on the key features, thus enhancing the generalization ability of the
model. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The code will be
available on Github at https://github.com/GuangqiangLi/TSA-SAN.

Abstract: Finding the most similar subsequences between two multidimensional time
series has many applications: e.g. capturing dependency in stock market or
discovering coordinated movement of baboons. Considering one pattern occurring
in one time series, we might be wondering whether the same pattern occurs in
another time series with some distortion that might have a different length.
Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no efficient framework

provides the exact solution of finding the most similar multidimensional
subsequences between time series where there is a difference in length both
between time series and between subsequences. The algorithm is built based on
theoretical guarantee of correctness and efficiency. The result in simulation
datasets illustrated that our approach not just only provided correct solution,
but it also utilized running time only quarter of time compared against the
baseline approaches. In real-world datasets, it extracted the most similar
subsequences even faster (up to 20 times faster against baseline methods) and

Abstract: Event cameras deliver visual data with high temporal resolution, low latency,
and minimal redundancy, yet their asynchronous, sparse sequential nature
challenges standard tensor-based machine learning (ML). While the recent
asynchronous-to-synchronous (A2S) paradigm aims to bridge this gap by
asynchronously encoding events into learned representations for ML pipelines,
existing A2S approaches often sacrifice representation expressivity and
generalizability compared to dense, synchronous methods. This paper introduces
EVA (EVent Asynchronous representation learning), a novel A2S framework to
generate highly expressive and generalizable event-by-event representations.
Inspired by the analogy between events and language, EVA uniquely adapts
advances from language modeling in linear attention and self-supervised
learning for its construction. In demonstration, EVA outperforms prior A2S
methods on recognition tasks (DVS128-Gesture and N-Cars), and represents the
first A2S framework to successfully master demanding detection tasks, achieving
a remarkable 47.7 mAP on the Gen1 dataset. These results underscore EVA's

Conclusion: DB-PINN通过动态权重调整有效解决了PINN中的多目标优化问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a new learning
paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by enforcing the
constraints of physical equations, boundary conditions (BCs), and initial
conditions (ICs) into the loss function. Despite their successes, vanilla PINNs
still suffer from poor accuracy and slow convergence due to the intractable
multi-objective optimization issue. In this paper, we propose a novel
Dual-Balanced PINN (DB-PINN), which dynamically adjusts loss weights by
integrating inter-balancing and intra-balancing to alleviate two imbalance
issues in PINNs. Inter-balancing aims to mitigate the gradient imbalance
between PDE residual loss and condition-fitting losses by determining an
aggregated weight that offsets their gradient distribution discrepancies.
Intra-balancing acts on condition-fitting losses to tackle the imbalance in
fitting difficulty across diverse conditions. By evaluating the fitting
difficulty based on the loss records, intra-balancing can allocate the
aggregated weight proportionally to each condition loss according to its
fitting difficulty levels. We further introduce a robust weight update strategy
to prevent abrupt spikes and arithmetic overflow in instantaneous weight values
caused by large loss variances, enabling smooth weight updating and stable
training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DB-PINN achieves significantly
superior performance than those popular gradient-based weighting methods in
terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy. Our code and supplementary
material are available at https://github.com/chenhong-zhou/DualBalanced-PINNs.

Result: DEP不仅缓解了SNNs对异构数据污染的脆弱性，还显著提升了整体鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DEP为SNNs的安全可靠部署提供了支持。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) process information via discrete spikes,
enabling them to operate at remarkably low energy levels. However, our
experimental observations reveal a striking vulnerability when SNNs are trained
using the mainstream method--direct encoding combined with backpropagation
through time (BPTT): even a single backward pass on data drawn from a slightly
different distribution can lead to catastrophic network collapse. Our
theoretical analysis attributes this vulnerability to the repeated inputs
inherent in direct encoding and the gradient accumulation characteristic of
BPTT, which together produce an exceptional large Hessian spectral radius. To
address this challenge, we develop a hyperparameter-free method called Dominant
Eigencomponent Projection (DEP). By orthogonally projecting gradients to
precisely remove their dominant components, DEP effectively reduces the Hessian
spectral radius, thereby preventing SNNs from settling into sharp minima.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DEP not only mitigates the vulnerability
of SNNs to heterogeneous data poisoning, but also significantly enhances
overall robustness compared to key baselines, providing strong support for
safer and more reliable SNN deployment.

Abstract: The intrinsic complexity of human biology presents ongoing challenges to
scientific understanding. Researchers collaborate across disciplines to expand
our knowledge of the biological interactions that define human life. AI
methodologies have emerged as powerful tools across scientific domains,
particularly in computational biology, where graph data structures effectively
model biological entities such as protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks
and gene functional networks. Those networks are used as datasets for paramount
network medicine tasks, such as gene-disease association prediction, drug
repurposing, and polypharmacy side effect studies. Reliable predictions from
machine learning models require high-quality foundational data. In this work,
we present a comprehensive multi-purpose biological knowledge graph constructed
by integrating and refining multiple publicly available datasets. Building upon
the Drug Repurposing Knowledge Graph (DRKG), we define a pipeline tasked with
a) cleaning inconsistencies and redundancies present in DRKG, b) coalescing
information from the main available public data sources, and c) enriching the
graph nodes with expressive feature vectors such as molecular fingerprints and
gene ontologies. Biologically and chemically relevant features improve the
capacity of machine learning models to generate accurate and well-structured
embedding spaces. The resulting resource represents a coherent and reliable
biological knowledge graph that serves as a state-of-the-art platform to
advance research in computational biology and precision medicine. Moreover, it
offers the opportunity to benchmark graph-based machine learning and network
medicine models on relevant tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed dataset by benchmarking it against the task of drug repurposing, PPI
prediction, and side-effect prediction, modeled as link prediction problems.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics from sparsely time-resolved snapshot data is crucial
for understanding complex cellular processes and behavior. Existing methods
leverage optimal transport, Schr\"odinger bridge theory, or their variants to
simultaneously infer stochastic, unbalanced dynamics from snapshot data.
However, these approaches remain limited in their ability to account for
cell-cell interactions. This integration is essential in real-world scenarios
since intercellular communications are fundamental life processes and can
influence cell state-transition dynamics. To address this challenge, we
formulate the Unbalanced Mean-Field Schr\"odinger Bridge (UMFSB) framework to
model unbalanced stochastic interaction dynamics from snapshot data. Inspired
by this framework, we further propose CytoBridge, a deep learning algorithm
designed to approximate the UMFSB problem. By explicitly modeling cellular
transitions, proliferation, and interactions through neural networks,
CytoBridge offers the flexibility to learn these processes directly from data.
The effectiveness of our method has been extensively validated using both
synthetic gene regulatory data and real scRNA-seq datasets. Compared to
existing methods, CytoBridge identifies growth, transition, and interaction
patterns, eliminates false transitions, and reconstructs the developmental
landscape with greater accuracy.

Abstract: The Traffic Assignment Problem is a fundamental, yet computationally

equilibrium, making real-time or large-scale scenario analysis challenging. In
this paper, we propose a learning-based approach using Message-Passing Neural
Networks as a metamodel to approximate the equilibrium flow of the Stochastic
User Equilibrium assignment. Our model is designed to mimic the algorithmic
structure used in conventional traffic simulators allowing it to better capture
the underlying process rather than just the data. We benchmark it against other
conventional deep learning techniques and evaluate the model's robustness by
testing its ability to predict traffic flows on input data outside the domain
on which it was trained. This approach offers a promising solution for
accelerating out-of-distribution scenario assessments, reducing computational
costs in large-scale transportation planning, and enabling real-time

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决POI推荐领域对老旧数据集（2012-2013）的依赖和缺乏全球多样性数据集的问题。

Method: 构建了Massive-STEPS数据集，覆盖12个多样化城市，包含2017-2018年的24个月数据，并评估了监督和零样本推荐模型。

Result: 提供了大规模、公开可用的数据集和基准测试代码，支持可重复和公平的研究。

Conclusion: Massive-STEPS有助于推动人类移动性和POI推荐领域的研究。

Abstract: Understanding human mobility through Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation
is increasingly important for applications such as urban planning, personalized
services, and generative agent simulation. However, progress in this field is
hindered by two key challenges: the over-reliance on older datasets from
2012-2013 and the lack of reproducible, city-level check-in datasets that
reflect diverse global regions. To address these gaps, we present Massive-STEPS
(Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins), a large-scale,
publicly available benchmark dataset built upon the Semantic Trails dataset and
enriched with semantic POI metadata. Massive-STEPS spans 12 geographically and
culturally diverse cities and features more recent (2017-2018) and
longer-duration (24 months) check-in data than prior datasets. We benchmarked a
wide range of POI recommendation models on Massive-STEPS using both supervised
and zero-shot approaches, and evaluated their performance across multiple urban
contexts. By releasing Massive-STEPS, we aim to facilitate reproducible and
equitable research in human mobility and POI recommendation. The dataset and
benchmarking code are available at:

Conclusion: RWPNN在非平稳环境中表现出色，能够适应不同数据集的变化率，无需强分布假设。

Abstract: In this paper, an unsupervised Recurrent Wavelet Probabilistic Neural Network
(RWPNN) is proposed, which aims at detecting anomalies in non-stationary
environments by modelling the temporal features using a nonparametric density
estimation network. The novel framework consists of two components, a Stacked
Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (SREnc-Dec) module that captures temporal features in
a latent space, and a Multi-Receptive-field Wavelet Probabilistic Network
(MRWPN) that creates an ensemble probabilistic model to characterise the latent
space. This formulation extends the standard wavelet probabilistic networks to
wavelet deep probabilistic networks, which can handle higher data
dimensionality. The MRWPN module can adapt to different rates of data variation
in different datasets without imposing strong distribution assumptions,
resulting in a more robust and accurate detection for Time Series Anomaly
Detection (TSAD) tasks in the non-stationary environment. We carry out the
assessment on 45 real-world time series datasets from various domains, verify
the performance of RWPNN in TSAD tasks with several constraints, and show its
ability to provide early warnings for anomalous events.

Motivation: 现有的图神经网络（GNNs）通常在单输入单输出（SISO）情况下近似图卷积，而实际应用多为多输入多输出（MIMO）场景，因此需要直接针对MIMO情况的优化方法。

Method: 通过卷积定理推导MIMO图卷积，并提出局部化MIMO图卷积（LMGC）作为近似方法，证明了其在多计算图下的表示能力。

Result: 实验证明LMGC能够结合多种方法的优势，并在多计算图下生成线性独立的表示。

Conclusion: LMGC为MIMO图卷积提供了一种有效的局部化近似方法，具有广泛的适用性和理论保证。

Abstract: Most graph neural networks (GNNs) utilize approximations of the general graph
convolution derived in the graph Fourier domain. While GNNs are typically
applied in the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) case, the approximations are
performed in the single-input single-output (SISO) case. In this work, we first
derive the MIMO graph convolution through the convolution theorem and
approximate it directly in the MIMO case. We find the key MIMO-specific
property of the graph convolution to be operating on multiple computational
graphs, or equivalently, applying distinct feature transformations for each
pair of nodes. As a localized approximation, we introduce localized MIMO graph
convolutions (LMGCs), which generalize many linear message-passing neural
networks. For almost every choice of edge weights, we prove that LMGCs with a
single computational graph are injective on multisets, and the resulting
representations are linearly independent when more than one computational graph
is used. Our experimental results confirm that an LMGC can combine the benefits
of various methods.

Method: 通过扰动训练模型并分析Hessian矩阵的主特征向量，评估损失值，研究ML和物理梯度的对齐条件。

Result: 物理残差不直接阻碍优化，但梯度的对齐是关键。高阶模型（如ARZ）的误差下限更大，且CFL条件是数据集适用性的重要指标。

Conclusion: PIML的成功依赖于ML和物理梯度的合理对齐，且需注意数据质量和模型阶数的影响。

Abstract: This study critically examines the performance of physics-informed machine
learning (PIML) approaches for traffic flow modeling, defining the failure of a
PIML model as the scenario where it underperforms both its purely data-driven
and purely physics-based counterparts. We analyze the loss landscape by
perturbing trained models along the principal eigenvectors of the Hessian
matrix and evaluating corresponding loss values. Our results suggest that
physics residuals in PIML do not inherently hinder optimization, contrary to a
commonly assumed failure cause. Instead, successful parameter updates require
both ML and physics gradients to form acute angles with the quasi-true gradient
and lie within a conical region. Given inaccuracies in both the physics models
and the training data, satisfying this condition is often difficult.
Experiments reveal that physical residuals can degrade the performance of LWR-
and ARZ-based PIML models, especially under highly physics-driven settings.
Moreover, sparse sampling and the use of temporally averaged traffic data can
produce misleadingly small physics residuals that fail to capture actual
physical dynamics, contributing to model failure. We also identify the
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition as a key indicator of dataset
suitability for PIML, where successful applications consistently adhere to this
criterion. Lastly, we observe that higher-order models like ARZ tend to have
larger error lower bounds than lower-order models like LWR, which is consistent
with the experimental findings of existing studies.

Motivation: 传统EMA方法在随机动态系统中的收敛性较弱，因为其赋予最新观测值的权重恒定，导致噪声无法完全消除。本文旨在改进EMA，提出$p$-EMA，以提升收敛性。

Method: 提出$p$-EMA方法，通过使最新观测值的权重以次谐波速率递减为零，改进EMA的收敛性。理论分析基于随机动态系统的自相关假设。

Result: 在温和的自相关假设下，$p$-EMA具有更强的随机收敛性。

Conclusion: $p$-EMA在随机动态系统中表现优于传统EMA，尤其适用于SGD的自适应步长控制。

Abstract: Averaging, or smoothing, is a fundamental approach to obtain stable,
de-noised estimates from noisy observations. In certain scenarios, observations
made along trajectories of random dynamical systems are of particular interest.
One popular smoothing technique for such a scenario is exponential moving
averaging (EMA), which assigns observations a weight that decreases
exponentially in their age, thus giving younger observations a larger weight.
However, EMA fails to enjoy strong stochastic convergence properties, which
stems from the fact that the weight assigned to the youngest observation is
constant over time, preventing the noise in the averaged quantity from
decreasing to zero. In this work, we consider an adaptation to EMA, which we
call $p$-EMA, where the weights assigned to the last observations decrease to
zero at a subharmonic rate. We provide stochastic convergence guarantees for
this kind of averaging under mild assumptions on the autocorrelations of the
underlying random dynamical system. We further discuss the implications of our
results for a recently introduced adaptive step size control for Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD), which uses $p$-EMA for averaging noisy observations.

Conclusion: 在几何边界条件下，分类问题可以实现接近理论最优的学习速率。

Abstract: We study classification problems using binary estimators where the decision
boundary is described by horizon functions and where the data distribution
satisfies a geometric margin condition. We establish upper and lower bounds for
the minimax learning rate over broad function classes with bounded Kolmogorov
entropy in Lebesgue norms. A key novelty of our work is the derivation of lower
bounds on the worst-case learning rates under a geometric margin condition -- a
setting that is almost universally satisfied in practice but remains
theoretically challenging. Moreover, our results deal with the noiseless
setting, where lower bounds are particularly hard to establish. We apply our
general results to classification problems with decision boundaries belonging
to several function classes: for Barron-regular functions, and for
H\"older-continuous functions with strong margins, we identify optimal rates
close to the fast learning rates of $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1})$ for $n \in
\mathbb{N}$ samples. Also for merely convex decision boundaries, in a strong
margin case optimal rates near $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ can be achieved.

Abstract: As climate change increases the threat of weather-related disasters, research
on weather control is gaining importance. The objective of weather control is
to mitigate disaster risks by administering interventions with optimal timing,
location, and intensity. However, the optimization process is highly
challenging due to the vast scale and complexity of weather phenomena, which
introduces two major challenges. First, obtaining accurate gradient information
for optimization is difficult. In addition, numerical weather prediction (NWP)
models demand enormous computational resources, necessitating parameter
optimization with minimal function evaluations. To address these challenges,
this study proposes a method for designing weather interventions based on
black-box optimization, which enables efficient exploration without requiring
gradient information. The proposed method is evaluated in two distinct control
scenarios: one-shot initial value intervention and sequential intervention
based on model predictive control. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is
conducted among four representative black-box optimization methods in terms of
total rainfall reduction. Experimental results show that Bayesian optimization
achieves higher control effectiveness than the others, particularly in
high-dimensional search spaces. These findings suggest that Bayesian
optimization is a highly effective approach for weather intervention
computation.

Abstract: Speaker diarization, the process of identifying "who spoke when" in audio
recordings, is essential for understanding classroom dynamics. However,
classroom settings present distinct challenges, including poor recording
quality, high levels of background noise, overlapping speech, and the
difficulty of accurately capturing children's voices. This study investigates
the effectiveness of multi-stage diarization models using Nvidia's NeMo
diarization pipeline. We assess the impact of denoising on diarization accuracy
and compare various voice activity detection (VAD) models, including
self-supervised transformer-based frame-wise VAD models. We also explore a
hybrid VAD approach that integrates Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
word-level timestamps with frame-level VAD predictions. We conduct experiments
using two datasets from English speaking classrooms to separate teacher vs.
student speech and to separate all speakers. Our results show that denoising
significantly improves the Diarization Error Rate (DER) by reducing the rate of
missed speech. Additionally, training on both denoised and noisy datasets leads
to substantial performance gains in noisy conditions. The hybrid VAD model
leads to further improvements in speech detection, achieving a DER as low as
17% in teacher-student experiments and 45% in all-speaker experiments. However,
we also identified trade-offs between voice activity detection and speaker
confusion. Overall, our study highlights the effectiveness of multi-stage
diarization models and integrating ASR-based information for enhancing speaker
diarization in noisy classroom environments.

Abstract: Fluid thermodynamics underpins atmospheric dynamics, climate science,

this, we present a novel physics-informed spatio-temporal surrogate model for
Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC), a canonical example of convective fluid
flow. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks for spatial feature
extraction with an innovative recurrent architecture inspired by large language
models, comprising a context builder and a sequence generator to capture
temporal dynamics. Inference is penalized with respect to the governing partial
differential equations to ensure physical interpretability. Given the
sensitivity of turbulent convection to initial conditions, we quantify
uncertainty using a conformal prediction framework. This model replicates key
features of RBC dynamics while significantly reducing computational cost,
offering a scalable alternative to DNS for long-term simulations.

Abstract: Data integration approaches are increasingly used to enhance the efficiency
and generalizability of studies. However, a key limitation of these methods is
the assumption that outcome measures are identical across datasets -- an
assumption that often does not hold in practice. Consider the following opioid
use disorder (OUD) studies: the XBOT trial and the POAT study, both evaluating
the effect of medications for OUD on withdrawal symptom severity (not the
primary outcome of either trial). While XBOT measures withdrawal severity using
the subjective opiate withdrawal scale, POAT uses the clinical opiate
withdrawal scale. We analyze this realistic yet challenging setting where
outcome measures differ across studies and where neither study records both
types of outcomes. Our paper studies whether and when integrating studies with
disparate outcome measures leads to efficiency gains. We introduce three sets
of assumptions -- with varying degrees of strength -- linking both outcome
measures. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight a cautionary tale:
integration can improve asymptotic efficiency only under the strongest
assumption linking the outcomes. However, misspecification of this assumption
leads to bias. In contrast, a milder assumption may yield finite-sample
efficiency gains, yet these benefits diminish as sample size increases. We
illustrate these trade-offs via a case study integrating the XBOT and POAT
datasets to estimate the comparative effect of two medications for opioid use
disorder on withdrawal symptoms. By systematically varying the assumptions
linking the SOW and COW scales, we show potential efficiency gains and the
risks of bias. Our findings emphasize the need for careful assumption selection
when fusing datasets with differing outcome measures, offering guidance for
researchers navigating this common challenge in modern data integration.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a score-based Integer Programming (IP) approach
for solving the Bayesian Network Structure Learning (BNSL) problem.
State-of-the-art BNSL IP formulations suffer from the exponentially large
number of variables and constraints. A standard approach in IP to address such
challenges is to employ row and column generation techniques, which dynamically
generate rows and columns, while the complex pricing problem remains a
computational bottleneck for BNSL. For the general class of $\ell_0$-penalized
likelihood scores, we show how the pricing problem can be reformulated as a
difference of submodular optimization problem, and how the Difference of Convex
Algorithm (DCA) can be applied as an inexact method to efficiently solve the
pricing problems. Empirically, we show that, for continuous Gaussian data, our
row and column generation approach yields solutions with higher quality than
state-of-the-art score-based approaches, especially when the graph density
increases, and achieves comparable performance against benchmark
constraint-based and hybrid approaches, even when the graph size increases.

Abstract: The spreading dynamics in social networks are often studied under the
assumption that individuals' statuses, whether informed or infected, are fully

unobservable, which is crucial for determining an individual's potential to
further spread the infection. While this final status is hidden, intermediate
indicators such as symptoms of infection are observable and provide important
insights into the spread process. We propose a partial observability-aware
Machine Learning framework to learn the characteristics of the spreading model.
We term the method Distribution Classification, which utilizes the power of
classifiers to infer the underlying transmission dynamics. We evaluate our
method on two types of synthetic networks and extend the study to a real-world
insider trading network. Results show that the method performs well, especially
on complex networks with high cyclic connectivity, supporting its utility in
analyzing real-world spreading phenomena where direct observation of individual

Abstract: Style Transfer with Inference-Time Optimisation (ST-ITO) is a recent approach
for transferring the applied effects of a reference audio to a raw audio track.
It optimises the effect parameters to minimise the distance between the style
embeddings of the processed audio and the reference. However, this method
treats all possible configurations equally and relies solely on the embedding
space, which can lead to unrealistic or biased results. We address this pitfall
by introducing a Gaussian prior derived from a vocal preset dataset, DiffVox,
over the parameter space. The resulting optimisation is equivalent to
maximum-a-posteriori estimation. Evaluations on vocal effects transfer on the
MedleyDB dataset show significant improvements across metrics compared to
baselines, including a blind audio effects estimator, nearest-neighbour
approaches, and uncalibrated ST-ITO. The proposed calibration reduces parameter
mean squared error by up to 33% and matches the reference style better.
Subjective evaluations with 16 participants confirm our method's superiority,
especially in limited data regimes. This work demonstrates how incorporating
prior knowledge in inference time enhances audio effects transfer, paving the
way for more effective and realistic audio processing systems.

Abstract: Constrained Bayesian optimization (CBO) methods have seen significant success
in black-box optimization with constraints, and one of the most commonly used
CBO methods is the constrained expected improvement (CEI) algorithm. CEI is a
natural extension of the expected improvement (EI) when constraints are
incorporated. However, the theoretical convergence rate of CEI has not been
established. In this work, we study the convergence rate of CEI by analyzing
its simple regret upper bound. First, we show that when the objective function
$f$ and constraint function $c$ are assumed to each lie in a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS), CEI achieves the convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}
\left(t^{-\frac{1}{2}}\log^{\frac{d+1}{2}}(t) \right) \ \text{and }\
\mathcal{O}\left(t^{\frac{-\nu}{2\nu+d}} \log^{\frac{\nu}{2\nu+d}}(t)\right)$
for the commonly used squared exponential and Mat\'{e}rn kernels, respectively.
Second, we show that when $f$ and $c$ are assumed to be sampled from Gaussian
processes (GPs), CEI achieves the same convergence rates with a high
probability. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the theoretical
analysis.

Abstract: In this paper, we take a fresh look at stochastic approximation (SA) and
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We derive new sufficient conditions for the
convergence of SA. In particular, the "noise" or measurement error need not
have a finite second moment, and under suitable conditions, not even a finite
mean. By adapting this method of proof, we also derive sufficient conditions
for the convergence of zero-order SGD, wherein the stochastic gradient is

Abstract: Neural networks have become ubiquitous with guitar distortion effects
modelling in recent years. Despite their ability to yield perceptually
convincing models, they are susceptible to frequency aliasing when driven by
high frequency and high gain inputs. Nonlinear activation functions create both
the desired harmonic distortion and unwanted aliasing distortion as the
bandwidth of the signal is expanded beyond the Nyquist frequency. Here, we
present a method for reducing aliasing in neural models via a teacher-student
fine tuning approach, where the teacher is a pre-trained model with its weights
frozen, and the student is a copy of this with learnable parameters. The
student is fine-tuned against an aliasing-free dataset generated by passing
sinusoids through the original model and removing non-harmonic components from
the output spectra. Our results show that this method significantly suppresses
aliasing for both long-short-term-memory networks (LSTM) and temporal
convolutional networks (TCN). In the majority of our case studies, the
reduction in aliasing was greater than that achieved by two times oversampling.
One side-effect of the proposed method is that harmonic distortion components
are also affected. This adverse effect was found to be model-dependent, with
the LSTM models giving the best balance between anti-aliasing and preserving
the perceived similarity to an analog reference device.

Abstract: As the number of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) installations increases,
aggregators and system operators are required to monitor and analyze these
systems, raising the challenge of integration and management of large,
spatially distributed time-series data that are both high-dimensional and
affected by missing values. In this work, a probabilistic entity
embedding-based clustering framework is proposed to address these problems.
This method encodes each PV system's characteristic power generation patterns
and uncertainty as a probability distribution, then groups systems by their
statistical distances and agglomerative clustering. Applied to a multi-year
residential PV dataset, it produces concise, uncertainty-aware cluster profiles
that outperform a physics-based baseline in representativeness and robustness,
and support reliable missing-value imputation. A systematic hyperparameter
study further offers practical guidance for balancing model performance and
robustness.

Abstract: Polymers are large macromolecules composed of repeating structural units
known as monomers and are widely applied in fields such as energy storage,
construction, medicine, and aerospace. However, existing graph neural network
methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of
polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true
polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we
introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer
representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their
graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree
alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We
provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and
data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal
augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer
benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that
generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry is the dominant technology in the field of proteomics,
enabling high-throughput analysis of the protein content of complex biological
samples. Due to the complexity of the instrumentation and resulting data,
sophisticated computational methods are required for the processing and
interpretation of acquired mass spectra. Machine learning has shown great
promise to improve the analysis of mass spectrometry data, with numerous
purpose-built methods for improving specific steps in the data acquisition and
analysis pipeline reaching widespread adoption. Here, we propose unifying
various spectrum prediction tasks under a single foundation model for mass
spectra. To this end, we pre-train a spectrum encoder using de novo sequencing
as a pre-training task. We then show that using these pre-trained spectrum
representations improves our performance on the four downstream tasks of
spectrum quality prediction, chimericity prediction, phosphorylation
prediction, and glycosylation status prediction. Finally, we perform multi-task
fine-tuning and find that this approach improves the performance on each task
individually. Overall, our work demonstrates that a foundation model for tandem
mass spectrometry proteomics trained on de novo sequencing learns generalizable
representations of spectra, improves performance on downstream tasks where
training data is limited, and can ultimately enhance data acquisition and
analysis in proteomics experiments.

Conclusion: LGBQPC显著提升了GBDPC在复杂数据上的表现。

Abstract: The density peaks clustering (DPC) algorithm has attracted considerable
attention for its ability to detect arbitrarily shaped clusters based on a
simple yet effective assumption. Recent advancements integrating granular-ball
(GB) computing with DPC have led to the GB-based DPC (GBDPC) algorithm, which
improves computational efficiency. However, GBDPC demonstrates limitations when
handling complex clustering tasks, particularly those involving data with
complex manifold structures or non-uniform density distributions. To overcome
these challenges, this paper proposes the local GB quality peaks clustering
(LGBQPC) algorithm, which offers comprehensive improvements to GBDPC in both GB
generation and clustering processes based on the principle of justifiable
granularity (POJG). Firstly, an improved GB generation method, termed GB-POJG+,
is developed, which systematically refines the original GB-POJG in four key
aspects: the objective function, termination criterion for GB division,
definition of abnormal GB, and granularity level adaptation strategy. GB-POJG+
simplifies parameter configuration by requiring only a single penalty
coefficient and ensures high-quality GB generation while maintaining the number
of generated GBs within an acceptable range. In the clustering phase, two key
innovations are introduced based on the GB k-nearest neighbor graph: relative
GB quality for density estimation and geodesic distance for GB distance metric.
These modifications substantially improve the performance of GBDPC on datasets
with complex manifold structures or non-uniform density distributions.
Extensive numerical experiments on 40 benchmark datasets, including both
synthetic and publicly available datasets, validate the superior performance of
the proposed LGBQPC algorithm.

Conclusion: 研究为优化算法提供了物理基础，解释了现有算法（如矩阵乘法权重更新）的高效性。

Abstract: In quantum thermodynamics, a system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list
of non-commuting charges representing conserved quantities like particle number
or electric charge, and an important goal is to determine the system's minimum
energy in the presence of these conserved charges. In optimization theory, a
semi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over
the cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space.
These problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization
communities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are
essentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by
quantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the
aforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant
solution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is
concave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard
(stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these
parameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low
temperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for
the minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent
approach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid
quantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it
can be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the
algorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum
thermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why
algorithms published fifty years after Jaynes' seminal work, including the
matrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient
update method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at
solving SDPs.

Abstract: Surface information derived from exospheric measurements at planetary bodies
complements surface mapping provided by dedicated imagers, offering critical
insights into surface release processes, interactions within the planetary
environment, space weathering, and planetary evolution. This study explores the
feasibility of deriving Mercury's regolith elemental composition from in-situ
measurements of its neutral exosphere using deep neural networks (DNNs). We
present a supervised feed-forward DNN architecture - a multilayer perceptron
(MLP) - that, starting from exospheric densities and proton precipitation
fluxes, predicts the chemical elements of the surface regolith below. It serves
as an estimator for the surface-exosphere interaction and the processes leading
to exosphere formation. Because the DNN requires a comprehensive exospheric
dataset not available from previous missions, this study uses simulated
exosphere components and simulated drivers. Extensive training and testing
campaigns demonstrate the MLP's ability to accurately predict and reconstruct
surface composition maps from these simulated measurements. Although this
initial version does not aim to reproduce Mercury's actual surface composition,
it provides a proof of concept, showcasing the algorithm's robustness and
capacity for handling complex datasets to create estimators for exospheric
generation models. Moreover, our tests reveal substantial potential for further
development, suggesting that this method could significantly enhance the
analysis of complex surface-exosphere interactions and complement planetary
exosphere models. This work anticipates applying the approach to data from the
BepiColombo mission, specifically the SERENA package, whose nominal phase

Abstract: The implementation of thermally sprayed components in steel manufacturing

management. Two essential components--the data aggregator and the quality
predictor--are designed through continuous process monitoring and the
application of data-driven methodologies to meet the dynamic demands of the

effective multiple kernel learning strategy with the goal of realizing
predictive quality. The data aggregator, designed with sensors, flow meters,

prediction of coating quality based on the collected data but also proactive

Abstract: For singers of all experience levels, one of the most daunting challenges in
learning technical repertoire is navigating placement and vocal register in and
around the passagio (passage between chest voice and head voice registers).
Particularly in pop music, where a single artist may use a variety of timbre's
and textures to achieve a desired quality, it can be difficult to identify what
vocal register within the vocal range a singer is using. This paper presents
two methods for classifying vocal registers in an audio signal of male pop
music through the analysis of textural features of mel-spectrogram images.
Additionally, we will discuss the practical integration of these models for
vocal analysis tools, and introduce a concurrently developed software called
AVRA which stands for Automatic Vocal Register Analysis. Our proposed methods
achieved consistent classification of vocal register through both Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, which
supports the promise of more robust classification possibilities across more
voice types and genres of singing.

Abstract: The success of unsupervised learning raises the question of whether also
supervised models can be trained without using the information in the output
$y$. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is indeed possible. The key step
is to formulate the model as a smoother, i.e. on the form $\hat{f}=Sy$, and to
construct the smoother matrix $S$ independently of $y$, e.g. by training on
random labels. We present a simple model selection criterion based on the
distribution of the out-of-sample predictions and show that, in contrast to
cross-validation, this criterion can be used also without access to $y$. We
demonstrate on real and synthetic data that $y$-free trained versions of linear
and kernel ridge regression, smoothing splines, and neural networks perform
similarly to their standard, $y$-based, versions and, most importantly,
significantly better than random guessing.
