TL;DR: R2-Reasoner是一个动态路由框架，通过异构LLMs协作推理，优化任务分解和子任务分配，显著降低API成本同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步推理提升LLMs问题解决能力，但扩展推理链会增加token使用成本。许多简单子任务可由更高效的小规模语言模型处理，因此需要异构模型协作。

Method: 提出R2-Reasoner框架，包含任务分解器和子任务分配器，通过强化学习训练动态路由子任务到不同规模的模型。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，R2-Reasoner减少86.85%的API成本，同时保持或超越基线准确性。

Conclusion: R2-Reasoner为LLMs推理提供了更经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning has proven essential for enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into
intermediate steps, either explicitly or implicitly. Extending the reasoning
chain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can
furthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the
explosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and
can be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This
motivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying
capacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task
decomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To
address this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables
collaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing
sub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a
Reinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator.
The task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered
subtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most
appropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing
accuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline
that combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group
Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement
through iterative reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across four
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 86.85%
while maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy. Our framework paves the way
for more cost-effective and adaptive LLM reasoning. The code is open-source at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种异构的Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)方法，通过动态整合不同结构的PEFT适配器专家，解决了现有同质MoE-LoRA方法中的表示崩溃和专家负载不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有同质MoE-LoRA方法存在表示崩溃和专家负载不平衡问题，限制了LLM的潜力。

Method: 提出异构MoA方法，支持Soft MoA（加权融合所有专家输出）和Sparse MoA（稀疏激活专家）。

Result: 实验表明，异构MoA在性能和参数效率上均优于同质MoE-LoRA方法。

Conclusion: 异构MoA方法有效提升了预训练知识在下游任务中的迁移效果。

Abstract: Recent studies integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) to further enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Existing methods
employ \emph{homogeneous} MoE-LoRA architectures composed of LoRA experts with
either similar or identical structures and capacities. However, these
approaches often suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance,
which negatively impact the potential of LLMs. To address these challenges, we
propose a \emph{heterogeneous} \textbf{Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)} approach.
This method dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse
structures, leveraging their complementary representational capabilities to
foster expert specialization, thereby enhancing the effective transfer of
pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants:
\textbf{(i)} \textit{Soft MoA} achieves fine-grained integration by performing
a weighted fusion of all expert outputs; \textbf{(ii)} \textit{Sparse MoA}
activates adapter experts sparsely based on their contribution, achieving this
with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that
heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance
and parameter efficiency. Our project is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AvR（Alignment via Refinement）的新方法，通过长链思维（CoT）增强LLMs的递归推理能力，显著优于传统偏好优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的递归推理能力有限，尤其是在缺乏专家数据蒸馏的情况下，需要一种新方法来提升其性能。

Method: AvR通过引入一个结合批评和改进动作的细化过程，利用可微分学习技术优化细化感知奖励，生成多轮数据以支持测试时扩展。

Result: 实验表明，仅用3k合成样本，AvR将LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct模型在AlpacaEval 2.0上的胜率提升了20%以上。

Conclusion: AvR为LLMs的递归推理能力提供了一种有效的解决方案，具有显著性能提升。

Abstract: The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain
of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive
thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited,
particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel
method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through
long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism
and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to
optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized
multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further
enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly
outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k
synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct
model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Our code is available at

Result: 实验表明，ASTS在多个基准测试（如故事生成和摘要生成）中表现优于现有采样技术，减少了重复，提升了语义对齐和流畅性。

Conclusion: ASTS是一种高效且有效的解码策略，适用于需要高质量文本生成的任务。

Abstract: This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language
models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS)
algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling,
often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation.
To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS)
is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy
thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS
ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining
computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using
metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results
demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing
repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了电子商务中未充分探索的性别偏见维度，补充了现有AI危害框架的理解。

Abstract: While gender bias in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively
studied in many domains, uses of LLMs in e-commerce remain largely unexamined
and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates
this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the
context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to
existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated
product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require
specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively
analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for
this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these
forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,
under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing
size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and
differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our
understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:
exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for
the context of e-commerce.

Motivation: 扩展LLM的上下文长度是重要研究方向，但注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了效率。KV缓存压缩是解决这一问题的关键方法，但现有方法忽视了键和值的不对称性。

Method: 提出AsymKV框架，结合基于同质性的键合并和数学证明的无损值压缩。

Result: 在LLaMA3.1-8B等模型上，AsymKV在LongBench上平均得分43.95，显著优于现有方法（如H$_2$O的38.89）。

Conclusion: AsymKV通过有效利用KV缓存的不对称性，显著提升了长上下文建模的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical
importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of
attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context
modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this
challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet
previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive
similar attention weights (local homogeneity), adjacent values demonstrate
distinct heterogeneous distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a
critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values
uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression
framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a
mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods
across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV
achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like
H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.

Conclusion: 该方法具有潜力，未来可通过引入更多模式或规则挖掘作为代理等方式进一步优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are achieving significant progress almost every
moment now. Many advanced techniques have been introduced and widely accepted,
like retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG), agents, and tools. Tools can
query the database to answer questions from structured data files or perform
groupings or other statistics. This unlocks huge opportunities, such as it can
answer any question, but also poses threats, such as safety, because there is
no control over the commands that are created. We would like to discuss whether
we can create a new method that improves answers based on dataset/database via
some interpretable ML methods, namely enhanced association rules. The advantage
would be if the method can be also used in some safe technique like RAG.
Association rules have a sound history. Since the introduction of CN2 and
aproiri, many enhancements have been made. In parallel, enhanced association
rules have been introduced and evolved over the last 40 years. The general
problem is typically that there are too many rules. There are some techniques
for handling it, but when LLM emerged, it turned out to be the best use case
for the RAG technique for LLMs. We proposed a method that generates a ruleset
based on defined knowledge patterns, then converts rules into text form via a
rule-to-text converter, and includes the result as an RAG into LLM. We compared
this method with ChatGPT (even with using agents) and we have discovered a
significant improvement in answering questions based on the dataset. We have
also tried several strategies how much rules to generate. We found this
improvement interesting. Moreover, it can also be improved in many ways as
future work, like incorporating other patterns, the use of rule mining as an
agent, and many others.

Result: 在Chatbot Arena上，SynthesizeMe提示使个性化LLM评判准确性提升4.4%。结合奖励模型后，在PersonalRewardBench上表现最佳。

Conclusion: SynthesizeMe提供了一种无需额外身份信息的个性化奖励建模方法，显著提升LLM的评判性能。

Abstract: Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs)
encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work
on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information,
such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To
this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user
personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe
first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then
induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to
informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for
a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves
personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining
SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on
PersonalRewardBench: a new curation of user-stratified interactions with
chatbots collected from 854 users of Chatbot Arena and PRISM.

Conclusion: OPERA为LLM模拟个性化数字孪生提供了重要工具和基准。

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a
specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating
``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user
behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality,
publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the
internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce
OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected
from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the
first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser
observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time
rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser
plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the
first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's
next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action,
rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into
LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

generates soft prompts based on the input tokens and attends different tokens
with varying importance. Our method is simple and efficient, keeping the number

Abstract: When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge
about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.
At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve
interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well
known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their
training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models
memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to
specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact
memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of
synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well
as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments
showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing
apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in
effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. It
leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts,
enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate
reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG
frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a
critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do
graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this,
we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual
reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of
increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual
summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the
entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final
generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the
conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons
for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application. All related

Result: 实验表明POCL能稳定提升学生模型性能，适用于多种KD方法和模型家族。

Conclusion: 排序训练样本能显著提升KD的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，当前评估策略高估了遗忘效果，新框架提供了更真实和严格的评估。

Conclusion: 该框架为知识遗忘提供了更准确的评估方法，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in
large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus
on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential
dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs.
Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through
correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge
unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit
structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as
knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an
inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these
judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning
success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated
against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability.
Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our
framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning
performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies
tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: Temporal tabular question answering presents a significant challenge for

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升了7B规模模型的长文本写作性能，并展现出对长输入推理任务的良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: Writing-RL为长文本生成和长上下文训练提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled strong
performance in long-form writing, yet existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
approaches suffer from limitations such as data saturation and restricted
learning capacity bounded by teacher signals. In this work, we present
Writing-RL: an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework to advance
long-form writing capabilities beyond SFT. The framework consists of three key
components: Margin-aware Data Selection strategy that prioritizes samples with
high learning potential, Pairwise Comparison Reward mechanism that provides
discriminative learning signals in the absence of verifiable rewards, and
Dynamic Reference Scheduling approach, which plays a particularly critical role
by adaptively adjusting task difficulty based on evolving model performance.
Experiments on 7B-scale writer models show that our RL framework largely
improves long-form writing performance over strong SFT baselines. Furthermore,
we observe that models trained with long-output RL generalize surprisingly well
to long-input reasoning tasks, potentially offering a promising perspective for
rethinking long-context training.

Abstract: Table-based question answering requires complex reasoning capabilities that
current LLMs struggle to achieve with single-pass inference. Existing

error detection mechanisms and discard problem-solving experiences, contrasting
sharply with how humans tackle such problems. In this paper, we propose MAPLE

mimics human problem-solving through specialized cognitive agents working in a
feedback-driven loop. MAPLE integrates 4 key components: (1) a Solver using the
ReAct paradigm for reasoning, (2) a Checker for answer verification, (3) a
Reflector for error diagnosis and strategy correction, and (4) an Archiver
managing long-term memory for experience reuse and evolution. Experiments on
WiKiTQ and TabFact demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple LLM backbones.

Method: 使用Group-Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）在GSM8K和SimpleRL-Zoo数据集的中文、韩文和乌克兰语版本上微调模型，监控任务准确性和语言一致性。

Result: 发现GRPO会迅速放大预训练语言不平衡，语言一致性奖励可缓解偏移但牺牲准确性，且语言崩溃难以逆转。

Conclusion: 不同语言在推理任务中的训练效果不平等，奖励设计、数据难度和预训练先验对多语言推理有重要影响。

Abstract: We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the
chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant
pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different
language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by
exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is
not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual
LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of
the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,
Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and
language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading
to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates;
(ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the
expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting
language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent
fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original
target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a
remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for
reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping,
data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.

dual-process framework of fast and slow thinking into a tri-mode thinking
system involving a normal thinking mode to preserve the intrinsic capabilities
of LLM; (2) proposing the Thinking Density metric, which aligns computational
resource allocation with problem complexity; and (3) developing the Thinking
Mode Capacity (TMC) dataset and a lightweight Mind Router to predict the
optimal thinking mode. Extensive experiments across diverse mathematical,
commonsense, and scientific QA benchmarks demonstrate that DynamicMind achieves
superior ZSQA capabilities while establishing an effective trade-off between

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the

However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the
underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work,
we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability
distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning.
Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token
probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By
combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we
introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct
answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by
transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our
indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and
Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high
accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying
mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了代理设计的性能和效率。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities
across diverse domains. However, designing high-performing agentic systems
remains challenging. Existing agent search methods suffer from three major
limitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while
under-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and
tool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be
fully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search
space. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these
challenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models
agentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic
system designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a
predictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system
and task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the
search process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on
seven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our
method achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\% over state-of-the-art
baselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement

Abstract: Large language models frequently encounter conflicts between their parametric
knowledge and contextual input, often resulting in factual inconsistencies or
hallucinations. We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability
(SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence
with an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic,
deprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a
judge model evaluates the debate and determines the context's reliability. The
final answer is selected by combining the verdict with model confidence.
Experiments on the ClashEval benchmark demonstrate that SR-DCR consistently
enhances robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy on
trustworthy inputs, outperforming both classical debate and confidence-only
baselines with minimal computational overhead. The code is available at

Conclusion: FEEDER高效且兼容多种下游演示选择策略。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) delivers strong
few-shot performance by choosing few-shot demonstrations from the entire
training data. However, existing ICL methods, which rely on similarity or
diversity scores to choose demonstrations, incur high computational costs due
to repeatedly retrieval from large-scale datasets for each query. To this end,
we propose FEEDER (FEw yet Essential Demonstration prE-selectoR), a novel
pre-selection framework that identifies a representative subset of
demonstrations containing the most representative examples in the training
data, tailored to specific LLMs. To construct this subset, we introduce the
"sufficiency" and "necessity" metrics in the pre-selection stage and design a
tree-based algorithm to identify representative examples efficiently. Once
pre-selected, this representative subset can effectively replace the full
training data, improving efficiency while maintaining comparable performance in
ICL. Additionally, our pre-selected subset also benefits fine-tuning LLMs,
where we introduce a bi-level optimization method that enhances training
efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experiments with LLMs ranging from
300M to 8B parameters show that FEEDER can reduce training data size by over
20% while maintaining performance and seamlessly integrating with various
downstream demonstration selection strategies in ICL.

Conclusion: CatShift为保护专有数据提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
by excelling at interpreting, reasoning about, and generating human language.
However, their reliance on large-scale, often proprietary datasets poses a
critical challenge: unauthorized usage of such data can lead to copyright
infringement and significant financial harm. Existing dataset-inference methods
typically depend on log probabilities to detect suspicious training material,
yet many leading LLMs have begun withholding or obfuscating these signals. This
reality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of
identifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.
  We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference
framework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM
to overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data. If a
suspicious dataset was previously seen by the model, fine-tuning on a portion
of it triggers a pronounced post-tuning shift in the model's outputs;
conversely, truly novel data elicits more modest changes. By comparing the
model's output shifts for a suspicious dataset against those for a known
non-member validation set, we statistically determine whether the suspicious
set is likely to have been part of the model's original training corpus.
Extensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs validate
CatShift's effectiveness in logit-inaccessible settings, offering a robust and
practical solution for safeguarding proprietary data.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of large language models (FedLLMs) presents a promising
approach for achieving strong model performance while preserving data privacy
in sensitive domains. However, the inherent memorization ability of LLMs makes
them vulnerable to training data extraction attacks. To investigate this risk,
we introduce simple yet effective extraction attack algorithms specifically
designed for FedLLMs. In contrast to prior "verbatim" extraction attacks, which
assume access to fragments from all training data, our approach operates under
a more realistic threat model, where the attacker only has access to a single
client's data and aims to extract previously unseen personally identifiable
information (PII) from other clients. This requires leveraging contextual
prefixes held by the attacker to generalize across clients. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approaches, we propose two rigorous metrics-coverage rate
and efficiency-and extend a real-world legal dataset with PII annotations
aligned with CPIS, GDPR, and CCPA standards, achieving 89.9% human-verified
precision. Experimental results show that our method can extract up to 56.57%
of victim-exclusive PII, with "Address," "Birthday," and "Name" being the most
vulnerable categories. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust
defense strategies and contribute a new benchmark and evaluation framework for

Abstract: Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge
with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.
We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving
zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the
corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when
evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is
little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However,
conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with
natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional
distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach
that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and
then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning
(ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method
relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator
LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world
applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art
results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages,
including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of
task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary

Conclusion: MIRIAD为医疗领域的LLM应用提供了更可靠的知识基础，支持多种下游任务。

Abstract: LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and
flexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate
medical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have
been equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical
knowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and
integrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw,
unstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs
to effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to
best surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs,
each rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical
literature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering,
grounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on
unstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an
operationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval.
Experiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with
MIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with
the same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover,
MIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to
37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive
map of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to
visually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to
unlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information
retrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces,
which ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of code generation with a large language
model (LLM), with a focus on generating SQL queries from natural language
questions. We ask: Instead of using supervised fine tuning with text-code
pairs, can we tune a model by having it interact with a database engine? We
frame this problem as a reinforcement learning problem where the model receives
execution-based feedback from the environment in the form of scalar rewards.
These rewards penalize execution failures and assign positive values when a
query returns a correct answer. We use the rewards within the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework. We use a tabular reasoning benchmark to
test and evaluate our findings. We find that with only weak supervision in the
form of question-answer pairs, RL-tuning improves the accuracy of model
generated SQL code from 31.49 to 49.83 while reducing error percentage from
25.43% to 14.71%. This improvement allowed the model nearly match the
performance performance to the larger SQLCoder-70B model. Our work demonstrates

capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on NLP
classification tasks. However, they typically rely on aggregated labels-often
via majority voting-which can obscure the human disagreement inherent in
subjective annotations. This study examines whether LLMs can capture multiple
perspectives and reflect annotator disagreement in subjective tasks such as
hate speech and offensive language detection. We use in-context learning (ICL)
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, evaluating four open-source LLMs across
three label modeling strategies: aggregated hard labels, and disaggregated hard
and soft labels. In few-shot prompting, we assess demonstration selection
methods based on textual similarity (BM25, PLM-based), annotation disagreement
(entropy), a combined ranking, and example ordering strategies (random vs.
curriculum-based). Results show that multi-perspective generation is viable in
zero-shot settings, while few-shot setups often fail to capture the full
spectrum of human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection notably
affect performance, though example ordering has limited impact. These findings
highlight the challenges of modeling subjectivity with LLMs and the importance
of building more perspective-aware, socially intelligent models.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在生成可执行图表代码时的高错误率问题，探索是否源于模型限制或单提示设计。

Method: 采用多代理流程（起草、执行、修复、判断），仅使用现成的GPT-4o-mini模型，在Text2Chart31和ChartX基准测试中验证。

Result: 执行错误率降至4.5%-4.6%，优于基线近5个百分点，但发现图表存在幻觉和可访问性问题。

Conclusion: 未来工作应转向提升图表美观性、语义保真度和可访问性，而非仅关注执行可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models can translate natural-language chart descriptions into
runnable code, yet approximately 15\% of the generated scripts still fail to
execute, even after supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We
investigate whether this persistent error rate stems from model limitations or
from reliance on a single-prompt design. To explore this, we propose a
lightweight multi-agent pipeline that separates drafting, execution, repair,
and judgment, using only an off-the-shelf GPT-4o-mini model. On the
\textsc{Text2Chart31} benchmark, our system reduces execution errors to 4.5\%
within three repair iterations, outperforming the strongest fine-tuned baseline
by nearly 5 percentage points while requiring significantly less compute.
Similar performance is observed on the \textsc{ChartX} benchmark, with an error
rate of 4.6\%, demonstrating strong generalization. Under current benchmarks,
execution success appears largely solved. However, manual review reveals that 6
out of 100 sampled charts contain hallucinations, and an LLM-based
accessibility audit shows that only 33.3\% (\textsc{Text2Chart31}) and 7.2\%
(\textsc{ChartX}) of generated charts satisfy basic colorblindness guidelines.
These findings suggest that future work should shift focus from execution
reliability toward improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and
accessibility.

Result: 实验表明DSSP-RAG能有效解决冲突，提升双流知识互补性，优于基线。

Conclusion: DSSP-RAG为LLMs知识冲突提供有效解决方案，提升生成稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a cost-effective approach to mitigate
the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating the
retrieved external knowledge into the generation process. However, external
knowledge may conflict with the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Furthermore,
current LLMs lack inherent mechanisms for resolving such knowledge conflicts,
making traditional RAG methods suffer from degraded performance and stability.
Thus, we propose a Dual-Stream Knowledge-Augmented Framework for Shared-Private
Semantic Synergy (DSSP-RAG). Central to the framework is a novel approach that
refines self-attention into a mixed-attention, distinguishing shared and
private semantics for a controlled internal-external knowledge integration. To
effectively facilitate DSSP in RAG, we further introduce an unsupervised
hallucination detection method based on cognitive uncertainty, ensuring the
necessity of introducing knowledge, and an Energy Quotient (EQ) based on
attention difference matrices to reduce noise in the retrieved external
knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DSSP-RAG can
effectively resolve conflicts and enhance the complementarity of dual-stream
knowledge, leading to superior performance over strong baselines.

Result: Cartridge在性能上与ICL相当，但内存消耗减少38.6倍，吞吐量提升26.4倍，且能扩展有效上下文长度。

Conclusion: Cartridge结合self-study是一种高效且经济的替代方案，适用于长上下文任务。

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications.
However, these systems often inherit associative and framing biases from
pre-training data, leading to inappropriate or unfair outputs in downstream
tasks. In this work, we present AdvSumm (Adversarial Summarization), a
domain-agnostic training framework designed to mitigate bias in text
summarization through improved generalization. Inspired by adversarial
robustness, AdvSumm introduces a novel Perturber component that applies
gradient-guided perturbations at the embedding level of Sequence-to-Sequence
models, enhancing the model's robustness to input variations. We empirically
demonstrate that AdvSumm effectively reduces different types of bias in
summarization-specifically, name-nationality bias and political framing
bias-without compromising summarization quality. Compared to standard
transformers and data augmentation techniques like back-translation, AdvSumm
achieves stronger bias mitigation performance across benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
demonstrating impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, deploying
these models introduces critical risks related to intellectual property
violations and potential misuse, particularly as adversaries can imitate these
models to steal services or generate misleading outputs. We specifically focus
on model stealing attacks, as they are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and
pose a serious threat to their security, revenue, and ethical deployment. While
various watermarking techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, it
remains unclear how far the community and industry have progressed in
developing and deploying watermarks in LLMs.
  To bridge this gap, we aim to develop a comprehensive systematization for
watermarks in LLMs by 1) presenting a detailed taxonomy for watermarks in LLMs,
2) proposing a novel intellectual property classifier to explore the
effectiveness and impacts of watermarks on LLMs under both attack and
attack-free environments, 3) analyzing the limitations of existing watermarks
in LLMs, and 4) discussing practical challenges and potential future directions
for watermarks in LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we show that despite
promising research outcomes and significant attention from leading companies
and community to deploy watermarks, these techniques have yet to reach their
full potential in real-world applications due to their unfavorable impacts on
model utility of LLMs and downstream tasks. Our findings provide an insightful
understanding of watermarks in LLMs, highlighting the need for practical

Abstract: Competitive programming, due to its high reasoning difficulty and precise
correctness feedback, has become a key task for both training and evaluating
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, while a
large amount of public problem data, such as problem statements and solutions,
is available, the test cases of these problems are often difficult to obtain.
Therefore, test case generation is a necessary task for building large-scale
datasets, and the quality of the test cases directly determines the accuracy of
the evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based agent system that
creates high-quality test cases for competitive programming problems. We apply
this system to the CodeContests dataset and propose a new version with improved
test cases, named CodeContests+. We evaluated the quality of test cases in
CodeContestsPlus. First, we used 1.72 million submissions with pass/fail labels
to examine the accuracy of these test cases in evaluation. The results
indicated that CodeContests+ achieves significantly higher accuracy than
CodeContests, particularly with a notably higher True Positive Rate (TPR).
Subsequently, our experiments in LLM Reinforcement Learning (RL) further
confirmed that improvements in test case quality yield considerable advantages
for RL.

Abstract: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a crucial task of natural language processing

achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, they still lag behind
state-of-the-art encoder-decoder (BERT-like) models in SRL. In this work, we
seek to bridge this gap by equipping LLMs for SRL with two mechanisms: (a)
retrieval-augmented generation and (b) self-correction. The first mechanism
enables LLMs to leverage external linguistic knowledge such as predicate and
argument structure descriptions, while the second allows LLMs to identify and
correct inconsistent SRL outputs. We conduct extensive experiments on three
widely-used benchmarks of SRL (CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012). Results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
Chinese and English, marking the first successful application of LLMs to
surpass encoder-decoder approaches in SRL.

Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to automatically produce free-text summaries of

a representative long-form example. While recent large language model
(LLM)-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in
clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from
limited patient information. In this paper, we propose R2AG, the first
reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation based on
pre-admission data. R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve
reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing explicit semantic
guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose Group-Based
Retriever Optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with
group-relative rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the
LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG
outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation
metrics. Further analysis reveals that R2AG fills semantic gaps in sparse input
scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical
misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in
Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range
of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including
their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs --
real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work
studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but
applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To
address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel
temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the
recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information,
converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as
additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link
prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network
(TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively
with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming
popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual
explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in
explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction. The code is

Abstract: As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to
mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate
ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality
evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and
personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first
large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality
expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset
spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to
elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We
evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response
formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with
country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in
Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive,
culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas
surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded
prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior.
By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that
CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally
adaptive LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL)
remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational
links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into
flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical
relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM
context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a
graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational
prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.
Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves
the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to
effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,
the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature
representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal
dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts
using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over
relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and
efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources. Code is

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown great power in improving Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing RAG-based LLMs are dedicated to
retrieving single modality information, mainly text; while for many real-world
problems, such as healthcare, information relevant to queries can manifest in
various modalities such as knowledge graph, text (clinical notes), and complex
molecular structure. Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality
domain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to
generate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present

composed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and
molecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions
that designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over
multimodal KG to answer questions. Our benchmarks indicate that existing LLMs
struggle to answer these questions and do well only when given the necessary
background data, signaling the necessity for strong RAG frameworks.

positing that LLMs can map discrete token counts to continuous wall-clock time,
and validate this through a dialogue duration judgment task. Second, we
demonstrate that LLMs could use this awareness to adapt their response length
while maintaining accuracy when users express urgency in question answering
tasks. Finally, we develop BombRush, an interactive navigation challenge that
examines how LLMs modify behavior under progressive time pressure in dynamic
environments. Our findings indicate that LLMs possess certain awareness of time
passage, enabling them to bridge discrete linguistic tokens and continuous
physical time, though this capability varies with model size and reasoning
abilities. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing
temporal awareness in LLMs for time-sensitive applications.

TL;DR: MisMitiFact是一个高效框架，用于生成基于事实的反驳虚假信息的响应，通过轻量级细粒度批评模型减少LLM幻觉，显著提高吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假信息对社会构成威胁，手动事实核查成本高且不可扩展，LLM在自动化反驳生成中具有潜力但存在幻觉问题。

Method: 提出MisMitiFact框架，利用轻量级批评模型对LLM输出进行细粒度修正，确保响应基于证据。

Result: MisMitiFact生成的反驳质量与LLM自反馈相当，但吞吐量提高约5倍，适合大规模应用。

Conclusion: MisMitiFact为高效、低成本的大规模虚假信息缓解提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Fake news and misinformation poses a significant threat to society, making
efficient mitigation essential. However, manual fact-checking is costly and
lacks scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in automating
counter-response generation to mitigate misinformation, but a critical
challenge lies in their tendency to hallucinate non-factual information.
Existing models mainly rely on LLM self-feedback to reduce hallucination, but
this approach is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose
MisMitiFact, Misinformation Mitigation grounded in Facts, an efficient
framework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses at scale. MisMitiFact
generates simple critique feedback to refine LLM outputs, ensuring responses
are grounded in evidence. We develop lightweight, fine-grained critique models
trained on data sourced from readily available fact-checking sites to identify
and correct errors in key elements such as numerals, entities, and topics in
LLM generations. Experiments show that MisMitiFact generates counter-responses
of comparable quality to LLMs' self-feedback while using significantly smaller
critique models. Importantly, it achieves ~5x increase in feedback generation
throughput, making it highly suitable for cost-effective, large-scale
misinformation mitigation. Code and LLM prompt templates are at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的推理时方法Shoes-of-Others（SoO）前缀，用于提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在心理理论（ToM）任务中的表现，适用于更广泛的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法专注于推断世界状态变化中的信念，但限制了适用范围。SoO前缀方法旨在减少对上下文的假设，提升通用性。

Method: 在LLM输出前添加前缀“Let's put ourselves in A's shoes.”（A为目标角色名），以引导模型生成更符合目标角色心理状态的输出。

Result: 在无需世界状态变化的对话和叙事基准测试中，SoO前缀显著提升了LLMs在五类心理状态上的ToM表现。

Conclusion: SoO前缀通过引导模型生成忠实于目标角色的思考，有效提升了ToM性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models
(LLMs) has not reached human-level performance yet. Since fine-tuning LLMs on
ToM datasets often degrades their generalization, several inference-time
methods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. However, existing
inference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from
contexts involving changes in the world state. In this study, we present a new
inference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes
fewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios. SoO
prefixing simply specifies the beginning of LLM outputs with ``Let's put
ourselves in A's shoes.'', where A denotes the target character's name. We
evaluate SoO prefixing on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and
narrative contexts without changes in the world state and find that it
consistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states. Our analysis
suggests that SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the
ToM performance.

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined
problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks
consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to
discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and
iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,
exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent
progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings
remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a
large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess
step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is
annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive
skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic
analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,
with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise
accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that
fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from
4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near
zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,
are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack
sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release
PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on
building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

Conclusion: 文本微调策略在低资源领域适应中具有潜力，同时避免了灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have combined speech
encoders with large language models (LLMs) through projection, forming Speech
LLMs with strong performance. However, adapting them to new domains remains
challenging, especially in low-resource settings where paired speech-text data
is scarce. We propose a text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs using
unpaired target-domain text without requiring additional audio. To preserve
speech-text alignment, we introduce a real-time evaluation mechanism during
fine-tuning. This enables effective domain adaptation while maintaining
source-domain performance. Experiments on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical
datasets show that our method achieves competitive recognition performance,
with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning. It also
improves generalization to new domains without catastrophic forgetting,
highlighting the potential of text-only fine-tuning for low-resource domain
adaptation of ASR.

and rigorously refining evaluation standards. This enables an accurate
assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly
surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted
functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through
refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o). (3) Challenge:
Models are required to apply multiple financial formulas for precise numerical
reasoning on 238 Hard problems. The best-performing model (i.e., OpenAI o1 with
PoT) achieves 89.1% accuracy, yet LRMs still face challenges in numerical
precision. We demonstrate that combining Reasoner and Programmer models can
effectively enhance LRMs' performance (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 87.8% for
DeepSeek-R1). Our work paves the way for future research on evaluating and

robust, culturally-aware multilingual NLP systems, especially in educational

Abstract: We develop a voice phishing (VP) detector by fine-tuning Llama3, a
representative open-source, small language model (LM). In the prompt, we
provide carefully-designed VP evaluation criteria and apply the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. To evaluate the robustness of LMs and
highlight differences in their performance, we construct an adversarial test
dataset that places the models under challenging conditions. Moreover, to
address the lack of VP transcripts, we create transcripts by referencing
existing or new types of VP techniques. We compare cases where evaluation
criteria are included, the CoT technique is applied, or both are used together.
In the experiment, our results show that the Llama3-8B model, fine-tuned with a
dataset that includes a prompt with VP evaluation criteria, yields the best
performance among small LMs and is comparable to that of a GPT-4-based VP
detector. These findings indicate that incorporating human expert knowledge
into the prompt is more effective than using the CoT technique for small LMs in
VP detection.

Conclusion: MEFA通过任务分解和模糊聚合有效提升ECI性能，减少LLMs的因果幻觉。

Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims to detect causal relationships
between events in textual contexts. Existing ECI models predominantly rely on
supervised methodologies, suffering from dependence on large-scale annotated
data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) enable zero-shot ECI, they are
prone to causal hallucination-erroneously establishing spurious causal links.
To address these challenges, we propose MEFA, a novel zero-shot framework based
on Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation. First, we decompose causality
reasoning into three main tasks (temporality determination, necessity analysis,
and sufficiency verification) complemented by three auxiliary tasks. Second,
leveraging meticulously designed prompts, we guide LLMs to generate uncertain
responses and deterministic outputs. Finally, we quantify LLM's responses of
sub-tasks and employ fuzzy aggregation to integrate these evidence for
causality scoring and causality determination. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate that MEFA outperforms second-best unsupervised baselines
by 6.2% in F1-score and 9.3% in precision, while significantly reducing
hallucination-induced errors. In-depth analysis verify the effectiveness of
task decomposition and the superiority of fuzzy aggregation.

Abstract: Deep transformer models have been used to detect linguistic anomalies in
patient transcripts for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) screening. While
pre-trained neural language models (LMs) fine-tuned on AD transcripts perform
well, little research has explored the effects of the gender of the speakers
represented by these transcripts. This work addresses gender confounding in
dementia detection and proposes two methods: the $\textit{Extended Confounding
Filter}$ and the $\textit{Dual Filter}$, which isolate and ablate weights
associated with gender. We evaluate these methods on dementia datasets with
first-person narratives from patients with cognitive impairment and healthy
controls. Our results show transformer models tend to overfit to training data
distributions. Disrupting gender-related weights results in a deconfounded
dementia classifier, with the trade-off of slightly reduced dementia detection
performance.

Abstract: Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable

potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the
multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the
Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal,
Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this
role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056
multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level
mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in
Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide
range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate
sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of
mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal
proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language
models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH
problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether a
sentence pair represents entailment, contradiction, or a neutral relationship.
While NLI models perform well on many inference tasks, their ability to handle
fine-grained pragmatic inferences, particularly presupposition in conditionals,
remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce CONFER, a novel dataset
designed to evaluate how NLI models process inference in conditional sentences.
We assess the performance of four NLI models, including two pre-trained models,
to examine their generalization to conditional reasoning. Additionally, we
evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, LLaMA, Gemma, and
DeepSeek-R1, in zero-shot and few-shot prompting settings to analyze their
ability to infer presuppositions with and without prior context. Our findings
indicate that NLI models struggle with presuppositional reasoning in
conditionals, and fine-tuning on existing NLI datasets does not necessarily

where we measure the contextual effect of the choice of dative construction
(prepositional or double object) on the semantic interpretation of utterances
(Bresnan, 2007). Specifically, we test whether "London" in "I sent London the
letter." is more likely to be interpreted as an animate referent (e.g., as the
name of a person) than in "I sent the letter to London." To this end, we devise
a dataset of 450 sentence pairs, one in each dative construction, with
recipients being ambiguous with respect to person-hood vs. place-hood. By
applying semantic-features, we show that the contextualized word embeddings of
three masked language models show the expected sensitivities. This leaves us

envision future physics-specialized LLMs that could handle multimodal data,
propose testable hypotheses, and design experiments. Realizing this vision

TL;DR: MLM4HG提出了一种基于掩码语言建模的方法，通过元路径文本序列替代HG令牌，统一不同图任务，提升异构图学习的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将HGNN与LLM结合时，HG令牌的嵌入空间差异会限制LLM对HG的理解，且任务泛化能力不足。

Method: MLM4HG将异构图转换为基于元路径的文本序列，设计统一的任务模板，通过掩码预测范式微调预训练语言模型。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的跨域和多任务实验中，MLM4HG在少样本和零样本场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MLM4HG通过文本化异构图和统一任务范式，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and
semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to
generalize across domains and tasks. Recently, some researchers have turned to
integrating HGNNs with large language models (LLMs) for more generalizable
heterogeneous graph learning. However, these approaches typically extract
structural information via HGNNs as HG tokens, and disparities in embedding
spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension
of HGs. Moreover, as these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks,
the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we
propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called
MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens
to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs
customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent
cloze-style "mask" token prediction paradigm. Specifically, MLM4HG first
converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently
combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover,
the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained
target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target
HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world
datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of MLM4HG over
state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Our code is
available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/MLM4HG.

Abstract: The fundamental process of evidence extraction and synthesis in
evidence-based medicine involves extracting PICO (Population, Intervention,
Comparison, and Outcome) elements from biomedical literature. However,
Outcomes, being the most complex elements, are often neglected or
oversimplified in existing benchmarks. To address this issue, we present
EvidenceOutcomes, a novel, large, annotated corpus of clinically meaningful
outcomes extracted from biomedical literature. We first developed a robust
annotation guideline for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from text
through iteration and discussion with clinicians and Natural Language
Processing experts. Then, three independent annotators annotated the Results
and Conclusions sections of a randomly selected sample of 500 PubMed abstracts
and 140 PubMed abstracts from the existing EBM-NLP corpus. This resulted in
EvidenceOutcomes with high-quality annotations of an inter-rater agreement of
0.76. Additionally, our fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, applied to these 500
PubMed abstracts, achieved an F1-score of 0.69 at the entity level and 0.76 at
the token level on the subset of 140 PubMed abstracts from the EBM-NLP corpus.
EvidenceOutcomes can serve as a shared benchmark to develop and test future
machine learning algorithms to extract clinically meaningful outcomes from
biomedical abstracts.

Conclusion: Auto Review系统通过自动化后处理，在保持高准确性的同时降低了人工成本。

Abstract: Automating benefit verification phone calls saves time in healthcare and
helps patients receive treatment faster. It is critical to obtain highly
accurate information in these phone calls, as it can affect a patient's
healthcare journey. Given the noise in phone call transcripts, we have a
two-stage system that involves a post-call review phase for potentially noisy
fields, where human reviewers manually verify the extracted
data$\unicode{x2013}$a labor-intensive task. To automate this stage, we
introduce Auto Review, which significantly reduces manual effort while
maintaining a high bar for accuracy. This system, being highly reliant on call
transcripts, suffers a performance bottleneck due to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) issues. This problem is further exacerbated by the use of
domain-specific jargon in the calls. In this work, we propose a second-stage
postprocessing pipeline for accurate information extraction. We improve
accuracy by using multiple ASR alternatives and a pseudo-labeling approach that
does not require manually corrected transcripts. Experiments with
general-purpose large language models and feature-based model pipelines
demonstrate substantial improvements in the quality of corrected call
transcripts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of Auto Review.

Result: 发现两个主要集群：高产低SLI和低产高句法复杂性高SLI，支持语言能力的连续模型。

Conclusion: 结果挑战了分类诊断框架，强调无监督学习在优化诊断和干预中的潜力。

Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of
children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive
abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle
developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language
development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised
machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and
targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years
across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic
features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish
linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production
with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic
complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited
intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.
Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity
rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical
diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning
techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

clinician's question, and second, to generate a short, citation-supported
response based on those sentences. We use few-shot prompting, self-consistency,

sentences are essential. We compare several models and find that a smaller 8B

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，提升了情感支持对话的质量。

Conclusion: IntentionESC和ICECoT显著改善了LLM在情感支持任务中的表现，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: In emotional support conversations, unclear intentions can lead supporters to
employ inappropriate strategies, inadvertently imposing their expectations or
solutions on the seeker. Clearly defined intentions are essential for guiding
both the supporter's motivations and the overall emotional support process. In
this paper, we propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation
(IntentionESC) framework, which defines the possible intentions of supporters
in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for
inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generating, they fundamentally
operate as probabilistic models trained on extensive datasets, lacking a true
understanding of human thought processes and intentions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT)
mechanism. ICECoT enables LLMs to mimic human reasoning by analyzing emotional
states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable support strategies,
thereby generating more effective emotional support responses. To train the
model with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge, we design an automated
annotation pipeline that produces high-quality training data. Furthermore, we
develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess emotional support efficacy
and conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Our data and code

Abstract: Mathematics is often perceived as a complex subject by students, leading to
high failure rates in exams. To improve Mathematics skills, it is important to
provide sample questions for students to practice problem-solving. Manually
creating Math Word Problems (MWPs) is time consuming for tutors, because they
have to type in natural language while adhering to grammar and spelling rules
of the language. Existing Deep Learning techniques for MWP generation either
require a tutor to provide the initial portion of the MWP, and/or additional
information such as an equation. In this paper, we present an MWP generation
system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that overcome the need for
additional input - the only input to our system is the number of MWPs needed,
the grade and the type of question (e.g. addition, subtraction). Unlike the
existing LLM-based solutions for MWP generation, we carried out an extensive
set of experiments involving different LLMs, prompting strategies, techniques
to improve the diversity of questions, as well as techniques that employ human
feedback to improve LLM performance. Human and automated evaluations confirmed
that the generated MWPs are high in quality, with minimal spelling and grammar
issues. However, LLMs still struggle to generate questions that adhere to the
specified grade and question type requirements.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are trained using
paired audio-text samples that are expensive to obtain, since high-quality
ground-truth data requires human annotators. Voice search applications, such as
digital media players, leverage ASR to allow users to search by voice as
opposed to an on-screen keyboard. However, recent or infrequent movie titles
may not be sufficiently represented in the E2E ASR system's training data, and
hence, may suffer poor recognition.
  In this paper, we propose a phonetic correction system that consists of (a) a
phonetic search based on the ASR model's output that generates phonetic
alternatives that may not be considered by the E2E system, and (b) a rescorer
component that combines the ASR model recognition and the phonetic
alternatives, and select a final system output.
  We find that our approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6%
relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles over a series of competitive
baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了性别歧视检测中的关键问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The detection of sexism in online content remains an open problem, as harmful
language disproportionately affects women and marginalized groups. While
automated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two
key challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even
in large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism
(EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the
overlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce
substantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting
nuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two
prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation
(DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate
semantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion
(CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with
task-specific semantic features. To further improve reliability in fine-grained
classification, we introduce an ensemble strategy that resolves prediction ties
by aggregating complementary perspectives from multiple language models. Our
experimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance across all tasks, with notable improvements of macro F1 by 1.5
points for binary classification (Task A) and 4.1 points for fine-grained
classification (Task C).

challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in
zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the
intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results
of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's
effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a
large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural

manual optimization.

Conclusion: CO-VADA是一种可扩展且实用的去偏解决方案，适用于提升SER系统的公平性。

Abstract: Bias in speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often stems from spurious

unfair predictions across demographic groups. Many existing debiasing methods
require model-specific changes or demographic annotations, limiting their
practical use. We present CO-VADA, a Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation
Debiasing Approach that mitigates bias without modifying model architecture or
relying on demographic information. CO-VADA identifies training samples that
reflect bias patterns present in the training data and then applies voice
conversion to alter irrelevant attributes and generate samples. These augmented
samples introduce speaker variations that differ from dominant patterns in the

Abstract: Although connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has the label context
independence assumption, it can still implicitly learn a context-dependent
internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we
investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this
end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on
knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we
introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on
Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain
evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs
outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation,
indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD
with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than
13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

Result: 实现了对PSG、DG和CG的统一表示，简化了连续和不连续句子的计算处理。

Conclusion: 统一表示方法为句法分析提供了新视角，并降低了计算复杂性。

Abstract: This paper advances a unified representation of linguistic structure for
three grammar formalisms, namely, Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency
Grammar (DG) and Categorial Grammar (CG) from the perspective of syntactic and
computational complexity considerations. The correspondence principle is
proposed to enable a unified representation of the representational principles
from PSG, DG, and CG. To that end, the paper first illustrates a series of
steps in achieving a unified representation for a discontinuous subordinate
clause from Turkish as an illustrative case. This affords a new way of
approaching discontinuity in natural language from a theoretical point of view
that unites and integrates the basic tenets of PSG, DG, and CG, with
significant consequences for syntactic analysis. Then this paper demonstrates
that a unified representation can simplify computational complexity with
regards to the neurocognitive representation and processing of both continuous
and discontinuous sentences vis-\`a-vis the basic principles of PSG, DG, and
CG.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的两阶段训练框架（Q-Ponder），用于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉质量评估，结合了评分准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将质量评分和推理描述视为独立任务，导致模型在评分和可解释性之间存在权衡。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：冷启动阶段通过教师模型蒸馏数据，强化学习阶段使用GRPO联合优化评分和推理一致性。

Result: Q-Ponder在评分回归基准上达到SOTA性能（SRCC提升6.5%），并在描述准确性和合理性上显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Q-Ponder框架成功解决了评分与可解释性的权衡问题，展示了在多任务中的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization
potential over diverse tasks.

Method: 提出双路径架构CoMemo和新型位置编码机制RoPE-DHR。

Result: 在七个基准测试中表现优于传统大视觉语言模型架构。

Conclusion: CoMemo有效解决了多模态处理中的视觉信息忽视和空间关系维护问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language
Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as
the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce
suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a
bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive
neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional
positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships
when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations,
we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path
with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual
information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional
encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to
maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended
sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context
comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering,
demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM
architectures. Project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御技术通常针对单模态模型或需要调整核心参数，而实际场景中无法修改冻结的视觉编码器或核心LLM参数，且缺乏攻击先验知识。因此，需要一种无需核心权重或攻击先验的防御方法。

Method: 提出Robust Instruction Tuning框架，仅微调适配器和文本嵌入层，结合输入多样性正则化和异常激活正则化，防止模型记忆触发模式。

Result: 在Flickr30k和MSCOCO数据集上对七种攻击的实验中，攻击成功率降至接近零，训练成本增加不到15%。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需核心权重或攻击先验的情况下，有效防御了后门攻击，且计算开销低。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated excellent
instruction-following capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to stealthy backdoor
attacks when finetuned using contaminated data. Existing backdoor defense
techniques are usually developed for single-modal visual or language models
under fully parameter-adjustable settings or rely on supervisory knowledge
during training. However, in real-world scenarios, defenders cannot modify
frozen visual encoders or core LLM parameters, nor possess prior knowledge of
unknown trigger patterns or target responses. Motivated by the empirical
finding that LVLMs readily overfit to fixed, unknown triggers, which can embed
malicious associations during adapter-level tuning, we aim to design a defense
that operates without access to core weights or attack priors. To this end, we
introduce a lightweight, certified-agnostic defense framework, Robust
Instruction Tuning, that finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding
layers under instruction tuning. Our method integrates two complementary
regularizations: (1) Input Diversity Regularization, which perturbs trigger
components across training samples to disrupt consistent spurious cues; and (2)
Anomalous Activation Regularization, which dynamically sparses adapter weights
exhibiting abnormally sharp activations linked to backdoor patterns. These
mechanisms jointly guide the model toward learning semantically grounded
representations rather than memorizing superficial trigger-response mappings.
  Extensive experiments against seven attacks on Flickr30k and MSCOCO
demonstrate that ours
  reduces their attack success rate to nearly zero, with an increase in
training cost of less than 15%.

Result: GPT-4V在零样本设置下达到85%以上的准确率，思维链提示表现最均衡。模型能结合低级视觉特征和上下文知识进行推理。

Conclusion: 尽管GPT-4V不及专用模型，但其通用性、解释性和百科全书式推理能力使其成为图像取证中的灵活工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

Conclusion: 动态模型可以通过监督学习获得，并有效引导世界模型的构建，在图像编辑任务中表现优异。

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

Conclusion: YoursProtoP有效解决了概念不一致问题，提升了模型解释的用户可理解性。

Abstract: Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention
due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based
reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major
limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users
due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are
inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single
concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and
human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how
concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for
incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce
YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of
prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user
needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits
concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's
preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic
FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS
datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual
perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or
non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand
the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually
incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work,
we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a
key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene
text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we
propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising
two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies
potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer
Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers
less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs
for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To
enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over
1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually
curated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic
hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for
scene text spotting and understanding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉Transformer的计算成本高，动态压缩令牌成为研究热点。现有方法存在信息损失大且需后训练的问题，因此需要一种更高效的令牌压缩方法。

Method: 提出了一种多对多的令牌转换框架，将令牌压缩统一为显式的令牌矩阵变换，保留更多信息且无需训练。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更好的计算-性能权衡，显著降低了计算成本和推理时间。

Abstract: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to
heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision
transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay
attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens
are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore
post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper,
we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token
matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special
forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many
Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing
methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free
acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework.
Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with
marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense
prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation,
and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better
computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference
acceleration.

Conclusion: VideoChat-A1通过模仿人类逐步思考过程，显著提升长视频理解能力。

Abstract: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,
while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer
context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been
proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a
long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video
is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long
video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.
Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy
temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To
fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.
Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long
videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it
can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into
these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the
shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking
process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for
thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our
VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long
video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema,
outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and
InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with
7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

Result: 在小型ResNet中替换部分层为FIS层，准确率仅相差0.1%，同时减少了可训练参数和计算量；异常检测模型在MVTec AD数据集上达到97.3%的AUROC。

Conclusion: FIS层是一种高效且通用的张量处理层，适用于多种任务，并能显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

Conclusion: ViT和ResNet结合的方法在公平性和泛化性上表现良好，Swin Transformer效果最好。

Abstract: Biometric face authentication is crucial in computer vision, but ensuring
fairness and generalization across demographic groups remains a big challenge.
Therefore, we investigated whether Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet,
leveraging pre-trained global features, can fairly authenticate different
demographic faces while relying minimally on local features. In this
investigation, we used three pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) ViT foundation
models from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for global features as well as
ResNet-18. We concatenated the features from ViT and ResNet, passed them
through two fully connected layers, and trained on customized face image
datasets to capture the local features. Then, we designed a novel few-shot
prototype network with backbone features embedding. We also developed new
demographic face image support and query datasets for this empirical study. The
network's testing was conducted on this dataset in one-shot, three-shot, and
five-shot scenarios to assess how performance improves as the size of the
support set increases. We observed results across datasets with varying
races/ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The Microsoft Swin Transformer
backbone performed better among the three SOTA ViT for this task. The code and

Motivation: 当前分割模型（如SAM和SAM-HQ）在处理复杂形状物体（如细长结构或精细边界）时表现不佳，需要更灵活的方法。

Result: 在BIG、ThinObject5K和DIS5K基准测试中，Talk2SAM比SAM-HQ提升了5.9% IoU和8.3%边界IoU。

Conclusion: 自然语言指导为复杂物体分割提供了灵活且有效的方法。

Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or
structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation
models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant
SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries,
leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach
that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging
objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text
prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into
the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ,
enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving
segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling
disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input.
We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K.
Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\%
boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural
language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object
segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods

Conclusion: SAVVY为动态3D空间推理设定了新标准，推动了AV-LLMs的发展。

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and

adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where
Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our
analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in
aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically

Conclusion: 未来架构可考虑将更多视觉处理任务分配给语言解码器。

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance

differences between similar text-image pairs. We construct a new dataset of
paired texts and images with similar overall expressions but distinct local
semantics, further introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to
emphasize such fine-grained semantic differences for desired image generation.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing text-to-image

Abstract: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual
intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene
understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a
fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key
challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but
unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work
introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by
expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating
candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and
training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence
(maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond
annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally,
we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21
held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed.
Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving
mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on
these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors
for scalable open-world visual understanding.

Result: 结果表明，LVLMs可能基于先验知识回答问题，而非真正理解视觉错觉。

Conclusion: 结论是LVLMs在视觉理解上存在局限性，数据集可用于进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools
for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision
studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision
language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.
However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished
actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine
cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along
with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies
between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same
actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar
geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and
fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and
apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to
recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,
they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA
questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge
of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available

Conclusion: HMVLM 通过结合视觉语言模型和优化提示策略，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的性能。

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow
architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake
commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates
high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck"
without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective
five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and
(3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and
sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to
achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025
Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown
unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively
integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential
has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work
investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal
prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level
on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot
performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves
few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid
exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full
conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing
pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test
data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this
framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that
alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide
comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs
and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP,
and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency
while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

Motivation: CFG在条件扩散模型中虽能提升样本保真度，但可能损害多样性并导致记忆化。FBG旨在通过动态调整引导强度解决这一问题。

Method: 假设条件分布受无条件分布线性污染，基于预测的反馈动态调整引导强度。

Result: 在ImageNet512x512上显著优于CFG，与LIG竞争，且适用于文本到图像生成。

Conclusion: FBG提供了一种数学框架支持的动态引导方法，优于固定引导方案。

Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample
fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce
memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular
sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a
state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need.
Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned
conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional
distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our
scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal
informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the
view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on
ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance
and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a
strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate
that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales
for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined
with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

HoloAssist benchmark confirm the effectiveness of our approach, where our

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with
a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for optimal policy design in dynamic

Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables real-time,

Additionally, we provide a quantitative evaluation methodology for assessing

performance and control stability.

Conclusion: 通过种子选择优化，可以在不增加比特率的情况下显著提升图像质量。

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines
require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A
recent diffusion-based method avoids this by generating human-oriented images
from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. This method, however, uses
a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this
paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from
multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To
reduce computational cost, the selection is performed based on intermediate
outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
across multiple metrics.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach to generate stereo

are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore,
we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and
fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo
generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we
further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo
consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across
diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Rapid spread of false images and videos on online platforms is an emerging
problem. Anyone may add, delete, clone or modify people and entities from an

generates false and misleading proof to hide the crime. Now-a-days, these false

false information. Many methods are available in literature for detecting those

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are observed to be one effective method
as it modifies the context and definition of images producing plausible results
via image-to-image translation. This work uses an independent discriminant
network that can identify GAN generated image or video. A discriminant network
has been created using a convolutional neural network based on

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,
with maximum gains of up to 44%.

Motivation: 现有视觉预训练方法假设每张图像仅含单一对象，限制了场景中心数据集的扩展性。ODIS通过对象级自蒸馏解决这一问题。

Method: 采用对象感知裁剪和掩码注意力，将自蒸馏粒度从图像级转移到对象级。

Result: ODIS在ViT-Large上实现了82.6%的k-NN准确率。

Conclusion: ODIS通过对象级自蒸馏显著提升了视觉表示能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking
at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI
interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision
Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and
variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65),
and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111
VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved
near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally
frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we
zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find
that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only
slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features
cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they
likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance
is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This
suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become
technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential
remains.

representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is
available at https://github.com/unigary/SPD.

Motivation: 视频分类模型因其时间维度复杂性高，评估鲁棒性具有挑战性。现有方法难以生成微小且有效的扰动。

Method: 采用多智能体强化学习（空间和时间）协作识别视频敏感区域，生成微小且视觉不可察觉的扰动。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频分类模型的鲁棒性评估提供了更有效和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Conclusion: 该方法结合VLM与先进修复技术，为图像增强任务提供了可扩展的自动化方案。

Abstract: Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications,
affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we
propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM
categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A)
super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B)
reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation
(high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C
undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific
degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual
quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through
specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated
solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of
VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

Conclusion: RADAR通过多模态特征和对比损失显著提升了检测性能，并提出了新的基准BBC-PAIR。

Abstract: Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically
alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion
models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the
door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an
important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To
this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted
AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features
from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive
loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these
techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its
generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic
evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with
images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR
achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and
localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code,

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI基准上达到SOTA，IoU提升1.5，推理速度快5.9倍。

Conclusion: 稀疏查询表示在3D占用预测中高效且灵活。

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated efficiency and performance of sparse query-based
representations for perception, state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction
methods still rely on voxel-based or dense Gaussian-based 3D representations.
However, dense representations are slow, and they lack flexibility in capturing
the temporal dynamics of driving scenes. Distinct from prior work, we instead
summarize the scene into a compact set of 3D queries which are propagated
through time in an online, streaming fashion. These queries are then decoded
into semantic Gaussians at each timestep. We couple our framework with a
denoising rendering objective to guide the queries and their constituent
Gaussians in effectively capturing scene geometry. Owing to its efficient,
query-based representation, S2GO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, outperforming prior art (e.g.,
GaussianWorld) by 1.5 IoU with 5.9x faster inference.

Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We

This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing
a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the
first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training
the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that
the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and

Conclusion: MORSE-500提供了一个可扩展、透明的基准，支持未来多模态推理研究。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

Conclusion: FRAME是一种紧凑且多功能的视频编码器，适用于密集视频理解和语言驱动任务。

Abstract: Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic
segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent,
spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall
short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video
models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense
prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame
encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current
and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to
spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge,
FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense
prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual
correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with
CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video
classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven
datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing
self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a
compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR) is a challenging problem due to
the complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images. Unlike approaches
that assume a broadly encompassing degradation space, we focus specifically on
achieving an optimal balance in how SR networks handle different degradation
patterns within a fixed degradation space. We propose an improved paradigm that
frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task learning problem, our work
addresses task imbalance in the paradigm through coordinated advancements in
task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing.
Specifically, we introduce a novel task definition framework that segments the
degradation space by setting parameter-specific boundaries for degradation
operators, effectively reducing the task quantity while maintaining task
discrimination. We then develop a focal loss based multi-task weighting
mechanism that precisely quantifies task imbalance dynamics during model
training. Furthermore, to prevent sporadic outlier samples from dominating the
gradient optimization of the shared multi-task SR model, we strategically
convert the quantified task imbalance into controlled data rebalancing through
deliberate regulation of task-specific training volumes. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistent
superiority across all degradation tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human
generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial
computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time
interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration
requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video
generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges.
Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the
minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions,
which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a
consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure
real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization
and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference
speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and
model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for
long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and
low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate
class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking,
listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for
fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent
capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless
integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches
further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined
font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is
computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time
customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework
that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned
on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font
datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to
new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning
approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated
glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To
support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets
tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively.
Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font
customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during
inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending,
and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile
framework for font customization tasks.

Conclusion: Domain-RAG为CD-FSOD提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects
with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While
data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot
learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for
both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as
copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve
the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target
domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these
challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided
compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG
consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided
background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the
input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then
retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative
model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and
retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the
newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without
requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces
high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including
CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show
consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new
state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: CSCL通过多模态一致性学习显著提升了虚假内容检测的细粒度感知能力。

Abstract: To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding
multi-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However,
most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency
within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed
forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the
fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and
text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders,
i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder
(SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality
semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same
criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each
module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional
supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the
forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues
based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove
that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results
of grounding manipulated content. Codes and weights are avaliable at

Abstract: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like
radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable
results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the
success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention
mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can
extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of
CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer
architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be
resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the
medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with
compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using
ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%,
which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper,
we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and
proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the
same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact
foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in
Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based
auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show
that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and
SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is

Result: 实验表明半监督方法常以牺牲可靠性换取准确性，UniMatchV2在域外评估中表现鲁棒但仍存在可靠性问题。

Conclusion: 建议采用RSS等更全面的评估指标，以更好地满足实际部署需求。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

Conclusion: FADE是一种高效、无需训练的视频编辑方法，充分利用预训练模型的先验知识。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to

we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive

comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 现有DBP方法对所有样本使用固定噪声水平，而研究发现不同样本的最优噪声水平可能不同，因此提出动态调整噪声水平的框架。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上，SSNI框架显著提升了DBP方法的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 样本特异性噪声注入是DBP方法的关键改进方向。

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: HAVIR通过融合拓扑和语义信息，显著提升了从fMRI数据重建复杂视觉刺激的能力。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between
neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in
autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy
Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion,
spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have
achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on
high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate
in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are
computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end
trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without
relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively
captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a
compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM

Conclusion: CLaMR通过动态模态选择和联合训练在多模态检索中表现优越，适用于长视频问答等任务。

Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision,
speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat
these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and
subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where
relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple
modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must
dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the
query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that
jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,
and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal
backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic
modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training
data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale
synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in
various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we
propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard
contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality
usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation
strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade
performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR
consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR
improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4
over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream
utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50%
boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on
LongVideoBench.

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic
understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The
framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset
using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for
efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model
evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first
benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs
based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target
off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint
and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk
assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert
VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or
LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle
actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial
capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios
spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified
multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings
in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in
complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for
architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By
addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the
development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.

Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to
generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown
promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first
large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs)
for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a
diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and
extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions:
(1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can
they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3)
How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context?
Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception
tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels
comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates
significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that
specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models
across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet
optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight
the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique
challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for
the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key
areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

Motivation: 解决标准PyTorch数据加载器在从云存储直接流式传输GeoTIFF文件时无法充分利用现代GPU的问题。

Method: 通过系统测试不同的加载器配置和数据参数，使用贝叶斯优化找到每种存储类型的最佳设置。

Result: 优化配置使远程数据加载吞吐量提高了20倍，本地吞吐量提高了4倍，GPU利用率达到85-95%。

Conclusion: 优化的远程加载方法在相同时间预算下实现了与本地训练相同的模型精度。

Abstract: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data
requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard
PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF
files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading
throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing
different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned
reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal
settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote
data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default
settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote
loading achieve the same accuracy as local training within identical time
budgets. We improve validation IoU by 6-15% and maintain 85-95% GPU utilization
versus 0-30% with standard configurations. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在长视频内容理解上存在局限，部分原因是现有基准测试倾向于关注细节而非深度理解。

Method: 引入MF$^2$基准，包含50多部电影和850对真假声明，要求模型识别核心叙事元素。

Result: 实验表明，当前模型在叙事理解任务上表现远逊于人类。

Conclusion: MF$^2$揭示了模型在长视频内容理解上的不足，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

Conclusion: 低差异像素块能显著提升图像重建质量，改进的ConvNADE模型在效率和性能上表现优异。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data
by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on
preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in
which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels
(referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As
our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally
efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover,
we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random
pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo
theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels
akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more
realistic reconstructed images.

constraints, our approach maintains 30.77% accuracy with formal differential
privacy guarantees. Counter-intuitively, low-end devices contributed most

Result: 在D-NeRF和NVFI基准上取得SOTA，PSNR提升10 dB，LPIPS减半。

Conclusion: 连续时间潜在动力学是实现复杂3D场景预测的有效方法。

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling
scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable
models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and
demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from
region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the
underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We
introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising
over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient
clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified
dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a
hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The
dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation
commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures
including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet),
transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to
establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level
cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts
toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a

Conclusion: 3D光流世界模型为机器人操作任务提供了一种统一的、跨硬件的解决方案。

Abstract: Manipulation has long been a challenging task for robots, while humans can
effortlessly perform complex interactions with objects, such as hanging a cup
on the mug rack. A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for
teaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot
action in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot
to learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within
diverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find
that understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical
clue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for
both humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow
world model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts
the future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action
planning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical
flow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect
pipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics
from these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on
language instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a
flow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and
leverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task
description. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.
Finally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an
optimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic
manipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without
hardware-specific training.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for
bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its
application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized
experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide
histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they
factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene
expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with
memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in
typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative
model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution
of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level
encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without
excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M
benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from
frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing
these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs
robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video

quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set

Abstract: In the field of Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE), Radio Frequency
(RF)-based methods can operate effectively regardless of lighting conditions
and obscured line-of-sight situations. Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically
involve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex
preprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF
signals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is
computationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler
in preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization
performance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE
model based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them
using a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model
outperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and
deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method
that takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked
subgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical
results demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in
PCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the
proposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements
when placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas,
contributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.

learning. Such queries are explicitly associated to interaction categories,
converted to image specific category representation via a transformer decoder,
and learnt via an auxiliary image-level classification task. This idea is
motivated by an earlier multi-label image classification method, but is for the
first time applied for the challenging human-object interaction classification
task. Our method is simple, general and effective. It is validated on three
representative HOI baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results on two
benchmarks.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote
sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep
learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR
image segmentation.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) videos play a crucial role in many computer vision
applications. Although existing video restoration (VR) methods can
significantly enhance video quality by exploiting temporal information across
video frames, they are typically trained for fixed upscaling factors and lack
the flexibility to handle scales or degradations beyond their training
distribution. In this paper, we introduce VR-INR, a novel video restoration
approach based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that is trained only
on a single upscaling factor ($\times 4$) but generalizes effectively to
arbitrary, unseen super-resolution scales at test time. Notably, VR-INR also
performs zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy
data during training. Our method employs a hierarchical
spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution
implicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and
noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired
magnification. Experimental results show that VR-INR consistently maintains
high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise during training,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in sharpness, detail
preservation, and denoising efficacy.

Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) technique plays a crucial role in
image processing by eliminating unwanted reflections from the background. These
reflections, often caused by photographs taken through glass surfaces, can
significantly degrade image quality. SIRR remains a challenging problem due to
the complex and varied reflections encountered in real-world scenarios. These
reflections vary significantly in intensity, shapes, light sources, sizes, and
coverage areas across the image, posing challenges for most existing methods to
effectively handle all cases. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical
Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture, an innovative Transformer-based design for
SIRR. Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer
blocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT
Transformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to
effectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical
Transformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections
of varying sizes and complexities. Extensive experiments conducted on three
publicly available testing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance,
validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 3D技术即使在动态现象中也能有效提升2D分析能力。

Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still
relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building
on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors
have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from
independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is
particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is
significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In
fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques
are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in
particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this
issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D
by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered
radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,
dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric
structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the
(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time
refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing
the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the
refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that
surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques
can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and
realistic setting.

Abstract: Generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input is a
challenging task, particularly under extreme viewpoint. Existing methods often
struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries,
leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel
framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh
representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by
explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric
consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view
datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective
training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight
LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality,
physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video

Abstract: Radiance field methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow easy
reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless,
pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still
each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete.
SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera
baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera
poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense
and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes.
To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned
features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct
sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning
primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two
efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian
primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing
scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives,
storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives
are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint.
We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution
can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes
we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle
specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.

Abstract: Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming
from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines.
Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and
leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data
remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations,
i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is
frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework,
named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner.
It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps,
hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks
to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires
well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is
flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the
fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed
method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image
restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental
results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex
degradations.

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction,
robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as
DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in
scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for
near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D
reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming
iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We
introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly
predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By
integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM
data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose
estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we
propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract
essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing
difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves
comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional
iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static
3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic
environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing
NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on
RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic
interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a
probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network
iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry.
Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain
the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss
of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and
occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that
Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic
environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.

Abstract: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has
become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection.
However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to
environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose
challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across
regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores
how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on
their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image
analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its
potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews
recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical
applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers
for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model
transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use
in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting
improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes
DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into
supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is
given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise
in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets
in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research.
This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering
insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA

benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this
gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking
suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation
protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune
specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,
cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench
effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under
varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of
how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.
Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and

hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature

Motivation: 传统小麦管理依赖人工专家检查，成本高且难以扩展。现有视觉语言模型因缺乏领域知识，在小麦管理任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出WisWheat数据集，包含三层设计：基础预训练数据集、定量数据集和指令微调数据集，用于增强VLM在小麦管理任务中的性能。

Result: 微调后的Qwen2.5 VL 7B模型在小麦压力和生长阶段任务中的准确率分别达到79.2%和84.6%，显著优于GPT-4o等通用模型。

Conclusion: WisWheat数据集有效提升了VLM在小麦管理任务中的性能，为农业领域的AI应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield.
Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert
inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently,
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable
scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of
domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks
results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing
vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose
WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM
performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset
of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology;
(2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer
triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction
Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress
diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g.,
Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements.
Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset
achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage
conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial
models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

Conclusion: SatelliteFormula填补了数据驱动学习与物理理解之间的鸿沟，实现了复杂环境变量的可解释建模。

Abstract: We propose SatelliteFormula, a novel symbolic regression framework that
derives physically interpretable expressions directly from multi-spectral
remote sensing imagery. Unlike traditional empirical indices or black-box
learning models, SatelliteFormula combines a Vision Transformer-based encoder
for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to
ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods
struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our
method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a
symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior
performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. SatelliteFormula enables interpretable modeling of complex
environmental variables, bridging the gap between data-driven learning and
physical understanding.

allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual
perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video
understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video
understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by
highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and
exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across
domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications.
Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main
research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric
understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis,
and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each
direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally,
we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives,
evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss
limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions.
By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire
advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing
machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner. A GitHub repo

Abstract: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness
the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While
recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO
tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral
diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally
transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable
self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1
and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware
sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing
modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify
radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive
cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global
contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that
incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed
distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both
classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench

Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the
brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in
neuroscience, generally achieved through invasive techniques. This study
investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural
activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on
one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural
populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and
biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural
sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of
experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied
on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that
current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design
noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at
the resolution of individual neurons.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are noted for their brain-like computation and

Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and
maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual
timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve
the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high
integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs,
achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on
COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6%

Abstract: Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of

therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for

verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain
adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange

data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set
intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and
GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small
overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves
the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning,
human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) generated from computer-aided design (CAD) is
widely used in industry, with several large datasets available. However, the
data in these datasets is represented in STEP format, requiring a CAD kernel to
read and process it. This dramatically limits their scope and usage in large
learning pipelines, as it constrains the possibility of deploying them on
computing clusters due to the high cost of per-node licenses.
  This paper introduces an alternative format based on the open, cross-platform
format HDF5 and a corresponding dataset for STEP files, paired with an
open-source library to query and process them. Our Python package also provides
standard functionalities such as sampling, normals, and curvature to ease
integration in existing pipelines.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360

estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation) to assess the
integrity of the data and its compliance with the original STEP files.

Abstract: Recent advancements in camera-based occupancy prediction have focused on the
simultaneous prediction of 3D semantics and scene flow, a task that presents
significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and
unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and
their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization
framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D
Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced
Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method
decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them
onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the
camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D
semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene
flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow
of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent
frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy
models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat
in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

Abstract: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that
jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct
3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce
monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an
image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,
compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented
inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D
parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and
complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh
diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained
weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A
compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of
disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables
structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,
ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.
To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level
annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that
PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D
meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,
demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding
and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.

Conclusion: ADR-MVS通过自适应深度范围和法线引导的优化，显著提升了航空图像的多视图深度估计效果。

Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images
is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform
traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key
differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth
ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with
low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive
Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve
multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth
range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal
estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the
range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth
boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating
convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are
progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for
precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation
is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness
within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement
module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results
demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU,
LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational
complexity.

MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted
in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and
TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review
(N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations.
TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial
tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment
effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for
articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown
promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level.
However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that
first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the
Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These
approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in
real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a
single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS
representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate
point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same
part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering
algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances.
Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the
separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size.
Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation
capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our
synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual
feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen
articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our
proposed method.

Motivation: 解决计算机视觉中多边形近似评估指标的选择问题，明确加权优值是否能替代Rosin指标。

Method: 通过理论分析、实验验证和统计检验（Pearson相关系数）比较两种指标。

Result: 理论证明和实验数据均表明两种指标独立且无相关性。

Conclusion: 加权优值不能替代Rosin指标，需根据具体需求选择评估方法。

Abstract: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a
digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing
required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared
their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the
goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was
pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason
and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure
called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal
approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness
of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit
as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An
attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -
weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be
used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,
experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The
mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are
analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are
independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments
carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical
analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two
measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a
sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal
scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn
using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit
instead of Rosin's measure.

Motivation: 传感器数据的时间不一致（staleness）会导致目标状态估计不准确，影响轨迹预测质量，从而威胁自动驾驶的安全性。

Method: 1) 为LiDAR和雷达数据引入相对于相机的时间戳偏移特征；2) 使用数据增强模拟实际部署中的传感器staleness模式。

Result: 在传统模型因传感器staleness性能显著下降的情况下，新方法在同步和异步条件下均表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法具有模型无关性，能有效提升传感器融合的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

Conclusion: DeformCL提供了一种更鲁棒、连续的血管表示方法，具有临床价值。

Abstract: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing
the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for
clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete
representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered
fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification
paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation
based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected
by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous
representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity,
noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training
pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable
properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates
the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in

Conclusion: DIF滤波器在事件视觉噪声处理中表现出高性能和广泛适用性，适合实际应用。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event
vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better
event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more
applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are
published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a
significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the
degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor.
We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with
Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate
the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new
high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community.
Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second
(MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution
of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the
dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but
with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise

textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a
source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field,
existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment
details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework
that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained
garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to
guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves
robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial
guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an
attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous
temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local
editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics.
Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve
low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to
ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect
StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments,
and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will
be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that
ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details
during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent
advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on
generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches
typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the
task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while
preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that
not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and
right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this
by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as
conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a
result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo
video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both
stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in
stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.

Conclusion: BiLIE有效解决了低光图像增强中的噪声和结构问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Under extreme low-light conditions, traditional frame-based cameras, due to
their limited dynamic range and temporal resolution, face detail loss and
motion blur in captured images. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have
introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement
algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global
low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural
discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an
innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE).
Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by
global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass
filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event
representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information,
and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a
Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency
structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local
noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused
representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color
bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality
ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By
enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical
features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity,
facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions
of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that
uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are
quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with
opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service
in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national
security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part
of the national security and provide the most valuable service during
surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals,
there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such
as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust
hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs
to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision
algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of
deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos
for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer
vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed
suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate
judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors
have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through
various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the
purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense
area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.

validation. Additionally, we have included 100 real-world testing images
without ground truth (GT) to further evaluate the practical performance of
reflection removal methods. All image pairs are precisely aligned at the pixel
level to guarantee accurate supervision. The dataset encompasses a broad
spectrum of real-world scenarios, featuring various lighting conditions, object
types, and reflection patterns, and is segmented into training, validation, and
test sets to facilitate thorough evaluation. To validate the usefulness of our
dataset, we train a U-Net-based model and evaluate it using five widely-used

Motivation: 解决传统皮肤点刺测试（SPT）中单一光照条件导致的检测不一致性问题，提高过敏反应的检测和界定准确性。

Method: 结合神经网络分割和算法化方法，利用32张不同光照条件下的图像进行过敏反应的检测和界定。

Result: 在多光照条件下，方法的准确性显著高于传统单一光照条件下的检测。

Conclusion: 多光照条件图像能显著提高过敏测试的准确性。

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

Abstract: Registration of histological and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for
more precise identification of structural changes and chemical interactions in
tissue. With histology and MSI having entirely different image formation
processes and dimensionalities, registration of the two modalities remains an
ongoing challenge. This work proposes a solution that synthesises histological
images from MSI, using a pix2pix model, to effectively enable unimodal
registration. Preliminary results show promising synthetic histology images
with limited artifacts, achieving increases in mutual information (MI) and
structural similarity index measures (SSIM) of +0.924 and +0.419, respectively,

Motivation: 目前缺乏自动化或半自动化的纵向肿瘤分割方法，而这对放疗、手术干预和化疗反应评估至关重要。

Method: LinGuinE通过刚性配准将初始肿瘤标记点传播到其他时间点，并使用点击有效性分类器筛选有效点以生成新分割。

Result: 在两项测试数据集上，LinGuinE将Dice系数提高了20%以上（p<0.05）。

Conclusion: LinGuinE是一种有效的自动化纵向肿瘤分割方法，适用于任意起始时间点。

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

Motivation: 慢性伤口护理资源密集且成本高，传统方法对患者和医护人员负担重，因此开发了WoundAIssist以提供便捷的远程解决方案。

Method: 应用采用用户中心设计，结合轻量级深度学习模型进行伤口分割，并通过患者数据和远程咨询实现持续监控。

Result: 可用性研究表明，应用具有优秀的用户体验和AI识别功能，患者和医生对其评价良好。

Conclusion: WoundAIssist填补了患者与医护人员之间的远程护理空白，并提供了设计远程监控应用的经验。

Abstract: The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations,
presents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations,
elevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is
resource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both
patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present
WoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to
support telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly
document wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians
remain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video
consultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep
learning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with
patient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing
progression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving
both patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly
design, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with
patients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and
favorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution
is two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an
easy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap
between patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for
remote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of
interdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital
health tools across clinical domains.

Motivation: 生成式AI系统在组织环境中的快速应用暴露了其记忆限制问题，导致重复错误和决策不透明。CMI旨在通过重新定义记忆为自适应基础设施，解决这一盲点。

Method: CMI通过Insight Layer架构实现，结合人类反馈、漂移检测和理由保存，将上下文记忆融入系统。

Conclusion: CMI为构建有效、可反思、可审计且社会负责的智能系统提供了框架，增强了生成式AI的韧性和机构适应性。

Abstract: A critical challenge remains unresolved as generative AI systems are quickly
implemented in various organizational settings. Despite significant advances in
memory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems
still have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or
reflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated
errors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory
Intelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent
systems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for
longitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather
than passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,
human-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured
capture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system
capability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this
vision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift
detection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into
systems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history,
judgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in
current AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating
intelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially
responsible is presented through CMI. This enhances human-AI collaboration,
generative AI design, and the resilience of the institutions.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在表格处理方面取得了显著进展，但相关任务的全面基准测试仍有限，限制了模型在这一重要领域的发展。

Method: MMTU基准测试基于数十年的计算机科学研究，设计了25个复杂表格任务，涵盖理解、推理和编码等技能。

Result: 前沿模型（如OpenAI o4-mini和DeepSeek R1）在MMTU上的表现仅为60%左右，表明仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: MMTU为结构化数据处理和分析的基础模型提供了重要基准，有望推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important
real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational
notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers,
data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown
remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database
copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains
limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,
evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like
NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks
that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model
progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K
questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively
evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at
the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science
research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by
professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills --
including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging
for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI
o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for
improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope
that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing
foundation models for structured data processing and analysis. Our code and

Abstract: Recent large-scale reasoning models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance on challenging mathematical benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
underlying their success remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce
the notion of a reasoning graph, extracted by clustering hidden-state
representations at each reasoning step, and systematically analyze three key
graph-theoretic properties: cyclicity, diameter, and small-world index, across
multiple tasks (GSM8K, MATH500, AIME 2024). Our findings reveal that distilled
reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) exhibit significantly
more recurrent cycles (about 5 per sample), substantially larger graph
diameters, and pronounced small-world characteristics (about 6x) compared to
their base counterparts. Notably, these structural advantages grow with task
difficulty and model capacity, with cycle detection peaking at the 14B scale
and exploration diameter maximized in the 32B variant, correlating positively
with accuracy. Furthermore, we show that supervised fine-tuning on an improved
dataset systematically expands reasoning graph diameters in tandem with
performance gains, offering concrete guidelines for dataset design aimed at
boosting reasoning capabilities. By bridging theoretical insights into
reasoning graph structures with practical recommendations for data
construction, our work advances both the interpretability and the efficacy of
large reasoning models.

Conclusion: SPRINT有效提升了LRMs的推理效率，适用于复杂推理任务。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but typically
generate lengthy sequential chains-of-thought, resulting in long inference
times before arriving at the final answer. To address this challenge, we
introduce SPRINT, a novel post-training and inference-time framework designed
to enable LRMs to dynamically identify and exploit opportunities for
parallelization during their reasoning process. SPRINT incorporates an
innovative data curation pipeline that reorganizes natural language reasoning
trajectories into structured rounds of long-horizon planning and parallel
execution. By fine-tuning LRMs on a small amount of such curated data, the
models learn to dynamically identify independent subtasks within extended
reasoning processes and effectively execute them in parallel. Through extensive
evaluations, we show that the models fine-tuned with the SPRINT framework match
the performance of reasoning models on complex domains such as mathematics
while generating up to ~39% fewer sequential tokens on problems requiring more
than 8000 output tokens. Finally, we observe consistent results transferred to
two out-of-distribution tasks of GPQA and Countdown with up to 45% and 65%
reduction in average sequential tokens for longer reasoning trajectories, while
achieving the performance of the fine-tuned reasoning model.

Conclusion: 新框架在满足约束、收敛性和效率方面表现优异。

Abstract: Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that
provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding
approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that
is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants
to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a
new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying
(every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling
process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient
(high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal
distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient
exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms
existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing
tasks.

Abstract: The growing application of artificial intelligence in sensitive domains has
intensified the demand for systems that are not only accurate but also
explainable and trustworthy. Although explainable AI (XAI) methods have
proliferated, many do not consider the diverse audiences that interact with AI
systems: from developers and domain experts to end-users and society. This
paper addresses how trust in AI is influenced by the design and delivery of
explanations and proposes a multilevel framework that aligns explanations with
the epistemic, contextual, and ethical expectations of different stakeholders.
The framework consists of three layers: algorithmic and domain-based,
human-centered, and social explainability. We highlight the emerging role of
Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing the social layer by generating
accessible, natural language explanations. Through illustrative case studies,
we demonstrate how this approach facilitates technical fidelity, user

Abstract: Reward modelling from preference data is a crucial step in aligning large

a causal paradigm, providing the rich toolbox of causality to identify the
persistent challenges, such as causal misidentification, preference
heterogeneity, and confounding due to user-specific factors. Inheriting from
the literature of causal inference, we identify key assumptions necessary for
reliable generalisation and contrast them with common data collection
practices. We illustrate failure modes of naive reward models and demonstrate
how causally-inspired approaches can improve model robustness. Finally, we
outline desiderata for future research and practices, advocating targeted
interventions to address inherent limitations of observational data.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents have recently emerged as advanced
paradigms that exhibit impressive capabilities in a wide range of domains and
tasks. Despite their potential, current LLM agents often adopt a
one-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users'
varying needs and preferences. This limitation motivates us to develop
PersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address
versatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two
complementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic
and semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the
agent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona
(defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary:
it leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while
the outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the
framework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that
simulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring
real-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between
simulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
PersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only
personalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time
real-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential
of our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences.

Method: 提出红队测试应关注产品安全规范、现实威胁模型和系统级安全。

Conclusion: 红队测试研究需调整优先级以应对AI快速发展的新威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safeguards, which implement request refusals, have
become a widely adopted mitigation strategy against misuse. At the intersection
of adversarial machine learning and AI safety, safeguard red teaming has
effectively identified critical vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art
refusal-trained LLMs. However, in our view the many conference submissions on
LLM red teaming do not, in aggregate, prioritize the right research problems.
First, testing against clear product safety specifications should take a higher
priority than abstract social biases or ethical principles. Second, red teaming
should prioritize realistic threat models that represent the expanding risk
landscape and what real attackers might do. Finally, we contend that
system-level safety is a necessary step to move red teaming research forward,
as AI models present new threats as well as affordances for threat mitigation
(e.g., detection and banning of malicious users) once placed in a deployment
context. Adopting these priorities will be necessary in order for red teaming
research to adequately address the slate of new threats that rapid AI advances
present today and will present in the very near future.

Conclusion: 为未来LLM的数据市场提供了可持续且公平的解决方案。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) requires vast amounts of high-quality
data from institutions that face legal, privacy, and strategic constraints.
Existing data procurement methods often rely on unverifiable trust or ignore
heterogeneous provider costs. We introduce a mechanism-design framework for
truthful, trust-minimized data sharing that ensures dominant-strategy incentive
compatibility (DSIC), individual rationality, and weak budget balance, while
rewarding data based on both quality and learning utility. We formalize a model
where providers privately know their data cost and quality, and value arises
solely from the data's contribution to model performance. Based on this, we
propose the Quality-Weighted Marginal-Incentive Auction (Q-MIA), which ranks
providers using a virtual cost metric and uses Myerson-style payments to ensure
DSIC and budget feasibility. To support settings with limited liquidity or
long-term incentives, we introduce the Marginal Utility Token (MUT), which
allocates future rights based on marginal contributions. We unify these in
Mixed-MIA, a hybrid mechanism balancing upfront payments and deferred rewards.
All mechanisms support verifiable, privacy-preserving implementation.
Theoretically and empirically, they outperform volume-based and trust-based
baselines, eliciting higher-quality data under budget constraints while
remaining robust to misreporting and collusion. This establishes a principled
foundation for sustainable and fair data markets for future LLMs.

differential privacy (MI-DP). Building on signSGD, we propose FERRET--Fast and
Effective Restricted Release for Ethical Training--which transmits at most one
sign bit per parameter group with Bernoulli masking.
  Theory: We prove each fired group leaks at most ln 2 nats; after subsampling
with rate s, the total privacy loss of G groups trained for T steps with firing
probability p is epsilon = G * T * s * p * ln 2. Thus FERRET achieves MI-DP for
epsilon in [0.1, 2] without additive noise.
  Practice: We evaluate three granularities--FERRET-MAX (finest), FERRET-EIGHTH
(medium), and FERRET-2 (coarsest)--on five LLMs (137M-1.8B parameters) against
DPSGD and Non-DP baselines. All methods trained for 1, 3, and 5 epochs.
  Utility: Across all settings, FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH beat DPSGD's perplexity. At
epsilon=0.5, 5 epochs: FERRET-EIGHTH achieves 3.98 perplexity vs DPSGD's 11.61
(2.9x better), within 23% of Non-DP (3.25).
  Privacy: MI-AUC stays at chance for FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH (~0.51), matching DPSGD
vs Non-DP's 0.76-0.99. FERRET-2 shows higher leakage (~0.55) due to lower
headroom.
  Efficiency: Stricter budgets fire fewer signs, so FERRET uses 19-33% of
DPSGD's training time and only 34-36% of Non-DP training time.
  Take-away: Sign-based MI-DP gets closer to achieving all three qualities of
the privacy, utility, performance trilemma: FERRET trains up to 5x faster,
achieves 3x lower perplexity compared to DPSGD and 1.2x greater than Non-DP,
all while providing formal, mathematically provable privacy guarantees using
zero additive noise. The results also show that, in certain instances, masked
1-bit updates can match non-private training utility while safeguarding data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly powerful but remain vulnerable
to prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs cause the model to deviate
from its intended instructions. This paper introduces Sentinel, a novel
detection model, qualifire/prompt-injection-sentinel, based on the
\answerdotai/ModernBERT-large architecture. By leveraging ModernBERT's advanced
features and fine-tuning on an extensive and diverse dataset comprising a few
open-source and private collections, Sentinel achieves state-of-the-art
performance. This dataset amalgamates varied attack types, from role-playing
and instruction hijacking to attempts to generate biased content, alongside a
broad spectrum of benign instructions, with private datasets specifically
targeting nuanced error correction and real-world misclassifications. On a
comprehensive, unseen internal test set, Sentinel demonstrates an average
accuracy of 0.987 and an F1-score of 0.980. Furthermore, when evaluated on
public benchmarks, it consistently outperforms strong baselines like
protectai/deberta-v3-base-prompt-injection-v2. This work details Sentinel's
architecture, its meticulous dataset curation, its training methodology, and a
thorough evaluation, highlighting its superior detection capabilities.

Building upon this benchmark, we develop an automatic evaluation framework that

Through the empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on \benchmark, we

investigate the complexity of regional representations outputted by our method
for neural networks with varying sizes. Lattice and logical representations of
neural networks are straightforward from regional representations as long as
they satisfy a specific property. So we empirically investigate to what extent
the translations by our algorithm satisfy such property.

Result: 攻击成功率比现有方法高5%至25%，且具有强迁移性。

Conclusion: Joint-GCG重新定义了RAG系统的脆弱性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models
(LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external corpora before generating
responses. This approach significantly expands LLM capabilities by leveraging
vast, up-to-date external knowledge. However, this reliance on external
knowledge makes RAG systems vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that
manipulate generated outputs via poisoned document injection. Existing
poisoning attack strategies typically treat the retrieval and generation stages
as disjointed, limiting their effectiveness. We propose Joint-GCG, the first
framework to unify gradient-based attacks across both retriever and generator
models through three innovations: (1) Cross-Vocabulary Projection for aligning
embedding spaces, (2) Gradient Tokenization Alignment for synchronizing
token-level gradient signals, and (3) Adaptive Weighted Fusion for dynamically
balancing attacking objectives. Evaluations demonstrate that Joint-GCG achieves
at most 25% and an average of 5% higher attack success rate than previous
methods across multiple retrievers and generators. While optimized under a
white-box assumption, the generated poisons show unprecedented transferability
to unseen models. Joint-GCG's innovative unification of gradient-based attacks
across retrieval and generation stages fundamentally reshapes our understanding
of vulnerabilities within RAG systems. Our code is available at

Conclusion: StealthInk是一种有效的LLM水印解决方案，支持多比特信息嵌入和快速溯源。

Abstract: Watermarking for large language models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to
identifying AI-generated text. Existing approaches, however, either compromise
the distribution of original generated text by LLMs or are limited to embedding
zero-bit information that only allows for watermark detection but ignores
identification. We present StealthInk, a stealthy multi-bit watermarking scheme
that preserves the original text distribution while enabling the embedding of
provenance data, such as userID, TimeStamp, and modelID, within LLM-generated
text. This enhances fast traceability without requiring access to the language
model's API or prompts. We derive a lower bound on the number of tokens
necessary for watermark detection at a fixed equal error rate, which provides
insights on how to enhance the capacity. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse tasks highlight the stealthiness, detectability, and resilience
of StealthInk, establishing it as an effective solution for LLM watermarking
applications.

Method: 将动作、过渡和目标表示为逻辑命题，通过构造性证明在直觉逻辑下进行决策。在结构化网格世界中实现了一个符号代理，通过目标链和条件跟踪构建可证明正确的计划。

Result: 与Q学习相比，该方法实现了完美的安全性、可解释行为和高效收敛，且无无效动作。

Conclusion: 该方法为强化学习提供了基于构造性逻辑和证明理论的新方向，适用于安全规划、符号认知和可信AI。

Abstract: We introduce a novel learning and planning framework that replaces
traditional reward-based optimisation with constructive logical inference. In
our model, actions, transitions, and goals are represented as logical
propositions, and decision-making proceeds by building constructive proofs
under intuitionistic logic. This method ensures that state transitions and
policies are accepted only when supported by verifiable preconditions --
eschewing probabilistic trial-and-error in favour of guaranteed logical
validity. We implement a symbolic agent operating in a structured gridworld,
where reaching a goal requires satisfying a chain of intermediate subgoals
(e.g., collecting keys to open doors), each governed by logical constraints.
Unlike conventional reinforcement learning agents, which require extensive
exploration and suffer from unsafe or invalid transitions, our constructive
agent builds a provably correct plan through goal chaining, condition tracking,
and knowledge accumulation. Empirical comparison with Q-learning demonstrates
that our method achieves perfect safety, interpretable behaviour, and efficient
convergence with no invalid actions, highlighting its potential for safe
planning, symbolic cognition, and trustworthy AI. This work presents a new
direction for reinforcement learning grounded not in numeric optimisation, but
in constructive logic and proof theory.

Conclusion: 新框架能更公平地反映评估者偏好分布，满足社会选择理论公理，适用于多样化任务。

Abstract: Conventional preference learning methods often prioritize opinions held more
widely when aggregating preferences from multiple evaluators. This may result
in policies that are biased in favor of some types of opinions or groups. The
objective of this paper is to develop a novel preference learning framework
capable of aligning aggregate opinions and policies proportionally with the
true population distribution of evaluator preferences. Our approach infers the
feasible set of evaluator population distributions directly from pairwise
comparison data. Using these estimates, the algorithm constructs a policy that
satisfies foundational axioms from social choice theory, namely monotonicity
and Pareto efficiency, as well as our newly-introduced axioms of
population-proportional representation and population-bounded robustness. We
propose a soft-max relaxation method that smoothly trade-offs
population-proportional representation with the selection of the Condorcet
winner (which beats all other options in pairwise comparisons). Finally, we
validate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach through experiments
on both tabular recommendation tasks and large-scale language model alignment.

inference into distinct phases - offers a promising path to improving the
throughput-interactivity Pareto frontier. Despite growing enthusiasm and a

system-level coordination. In this paper, we present the first systematic study

disaggregation is most effective for prefill-heavy traffic patterns and larger
models. Our results highlight the critical role of dynamic rate matching and
elastic scaling in achieving Pareto-optimal performance. Our findings offer
actionable insights for efficient disaggregated deployments to navigate the

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled near-human
performance on software coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness in RTL code
generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data.
While prior efforts have fine-tuned LLMs for RTL tasks, they do not
fundamentally overcome the data bottleneck and lack support for test-time
scaling due to their non-reasoning nature. In this work, we introduce ScaleRTL,
the first reasoning LLM for RTL coding that scales up both high-quality
reasoning data and test-time compute. Specifically, we curate a diverse set of
long chain-of-thought reasoning traces averaging 56K tokens each, resulting in
a dataset of 3.5B tokens that captures rich RTL knowledge. Fine-tuning a
general-purpose reasoning model on this corpus yields ScaleRTL that is capable
of deep RTL reasoning. Subsequently, we further enhance the performance of
ScaleRTL through a novel test-time scaling strategy that extends the reasoning
process via iteratively reflecting on and self-correcting previous reasoning
steps. Experimental results show that ScaleRTL achieves state-of-the-art
performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, outperforming 18 competitive baselines by
up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM.

Conclusion: PPA是一种高效且轻量级的防御方法，适用于保护LLM代理免受提示注入攻击。

Abstract: LLM agents are widely used as agents for customer support, content
generation, and code assistance. However, they are vulnerable to prompt
injection attacks, where adversarial inputs manipulate the model's behavior.
Traditional defenses like input sanitization, guard models, and guardrails are
either cumbersome or ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel,
lightweight defense mechanism called Polymorphic Prompt Assembling (PPA), which
protects against prompt injection with near-zero overhead. The approach is
based on the insight that prompt injection requires guessing and breaking the
structure of the system prompt. By dynamically varying the structure of system
prompts, PPA prevents attackers from predicting the prompt structure, thereby
enhancing security without compromising performance. We conducted experiments
to evaluate the effectiveness of PPA against existing attacks and compared it
with other defense methods.

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种生物启发的神经架构和框架，适用于解决具有非描述性终端条件的环境。

Abstract: Biological and psychological concepts have inspired reinforcement learning
algorithms to create new complex behaviors that expand agents' capacity. These
behaviors can be seen in the rise of techniques like goal decomposition,
curriculum, and intrinsic rewards, which have paved the way for these complex
behaviors. One limitation in evaluating these methods is the requirement for
engineered extrinsic for realistic environments. A central challenge in
engineering the necessary reward function(s) comes from these environments
containing states that carry high negative rewards, but provide no feedback to
the agent. Death is one such stimuli that fails to provide direct feedback to
the agent. In this work, we introduce an intrinsic reward function inspired by
early amygdala development and produce this intrinsic reward through a novel
memory-augmented neural network (MANN) architecture. We show how this intrinsic
motivation serves to deter exploration of terminal states and results in
avoidance behavior similar to fear conditioning observed in animals.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how modifying a threshold where the fear response
is active produces a range of behaviors that are described under the paradigm
of general anxiety disorders (GADs). We demonstrate this behavior in the
Miniworld Sidewalk environment, which provides a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) and a sparse reward with a non-descriptive terminal
condition, i.e., death. In effect, this study results in a
biologically-inspired neural architecture and framework for fear conditioning
paradigms; we empirically demonstrate avoidance behavior in a constructed agent
that is able to solve environments with non-descriptive terminal conditions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI reasoning have driven substantial improvements
across diverse tasks. A critical open question is whether these improvements
also yields better knowledge transfer: the ability of models to communicate
reasoning in ways humans can understand, apply, and learn from. To investigate
this, we introduce Knowledge Integration and Transfer Evaluation (KITE), a
conceptual and experimental framework for Human-AI knowledge transfer
capabilities and conduct the first large-scale human study (N=118) explicitly
designed to measure it. In our two-phase setup, humans first ideate with an AI
on problem-solving strategies, then independently implement solutions,
isolating model explanations' influence on human understanding. Our findings
reveal that although model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative
outcomes, this relationship is notably inconsistent, featuring significant
outliers, indicating that knowledge transfer requires dedicated optimization.
Our analysis identifies behavioral and strategic factors mediating successful
knowledge transfer. We release our code, dataset, and evaluation framework to
support future work on communicatively aligned models.

show that the agreement between Gemini and human judges is comparable to the
agreement between human evaluators. These promising results show that ALLMs can
be used as a judge to evaluate SLMs. Our results also reveal that current SLMs,
even GPT-4o-audio, still have room for improvement in controlling the speaking

Motivation: 探索LLM在教育领域的本地化应用，解决现有云解决方案的高成本和隐私问题。

Method: 使用3B-7B参数的小型LLM，结合RAG/CAG技术生成定制化教学内容，并通过交互式循环和辅助LLM验证器提升安全性和可靠性。

Result: 实验表明，小型LLM系统在特定任务上表现与大型模型相当，且成本更低、更安全。

Conclusion: 小型LLM系统可以为教育提供实用、经济、安全的支持。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized as
student-facing educational aids, their potential to directly support educators,
particularly through locally deployable and customizable open-source solutions,
remains significantly underexplored. Many existing educational solutions rely
on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may
raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require
affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source
framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for
customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely
incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement,
and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output
reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation
(RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled
content. Deployed on-premises for data privacy and validated through an
evaluation pipeline and a college physics pilot, our findings show that
carefully engineered small LLM systems can offer robust, affordable, practical,
and safe educator support, achieving utility comparable to larger models for
targeted tasks.

Conclusion: DesignBench为自动前端开发的未来研究提供了指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in automated front-end engineering, e.g., generating UI code from
visual designs. However, existing front-end UI code generation benchmarks have
the following limitations: (1) While framework-based development becomes
predominant in modern front-end programming, current benchmarks fail to
incorporate mainstream development frameworks. (2) Existing evaluations focus
solely on the UI code generation task, whereas practical UI development
involves several iterations, including refining editing, and repairing issues.
(3) Current benchmarks employ unidimensional evaluation, lacking investigation
into influencing factors like task difficulty, input context variations, and
in-depth code-level analysis. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DesignBench, a
multi-framework, multi-task evaluation benchmark for assessing MLLMs'
capabilities in automated front-end engineering. DesignBench encompasses three
widely-used UI frameworks (React, Vue, and Angular) alongside vanilla HTML/CSS,
and evaluates on three essential front-end tasks (generation, edit, and repair)
in real-world development workflows. DesignBench contains 900 webpage samples
spanning over 11 topics, 9 edit types, and 6 issue categories, enabling
detailed analysis of MLLM performance across multiple dimensions. Our
systematic evaluation reveals critical insights into MLLMs' framework-specific
limitations, task-related bottlenecks, and performance variations under
different conditions, providing guidance for future research in automated
front-end development. Our code and data are available at

Result: 在四个美国城市的实验中，CrimeMind在犯罪热点预测和空间分布精度上优于传统方法，提升达24%。

Conclusion: CrimeMind能够精细建模个体行为并评估现实干预措施，展示了LLM在城市犯罪模拟中的潜力。

Abstract: Modeling urban crime is an important yet challenging task that requires
understanding the subtle visual, social, and cultural cues embedded in urban
environments. Previous work has predominantly focused on rule-based agent-based
modeling (ABM) and deep learning methods. ABMs offer interpretability of
internal mechanisms but exhibit limited predictive accuracy.In contrast, deep
learning methods are often effective in prediction but are less interpretable
and require extensive training data. Moreover, both lines of work lack the
cognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Leveraging the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel
LLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban
context.A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine
Activity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to
process rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal
behavior.However, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating
environmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be
challenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated
dataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a
training-free textual gradient method.Experiments across four major U.S. cities
demonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep learning
baselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy,
achieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline.Furthermore, we
conduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and policy
interventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime
patterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual
scenarios.Overall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual
behaviors and facilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.

Abstract: Combinatorial problems are present in a wide range of industries. Constraint
Programming (CP) is a well-suited problem-solving paradigm, but its core
process, namely constraint modelling, is a bottleneck for wider adoption.
Aiming to alleviate this bottleneck, recent studies have explored using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as modelling assistants, transforming combinatorial
problem descriptions to executable constraint models, similar to coding
assistants. However, the existing evaluation datasets for constraint modelling
are often limited to small, homogeneous, or domain-specific instances, which do
not capture the diversity of real-world scenarios. This work addresses this gap
by introducing CP-Bench, a novel benchmark dataset that includes a diverse set
of well-known combinatorial problem classes sourced from the CP community,
structured explicitly for evaluating LLM-driven CP modelling. With this
dataset, and given the variety of constraint modelling frameworks, we compare
and evaluate the modelling capabilities of LLMs for three distinct constraint
modelling systems, which vary in abstraction level and underlying syntax: the
high-level MiniZinc language and Python-based CPMpy library, and the
lower-level Python interface of the OR-Tools CP-SAT solver. In order to enhance
the ability of LLMs to produce valid constraint models, we systematically
evaluate the use of prompt-based and inference-time compute methods adapted
from existing LLM-based code generation research. Our results underscore the
modelling convenience provided by Python-based frameworks, as well as the
effectiveness of documentation-rich system prompts, which, augmented with
repeated sampling and self-verification, achieve further improvements, reaching
up to 70\% accuracy on this new, highly challenging benchmark.

Conclusion: RefPlan提高了离线学习策略的灵活性、泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial when online exploration is
costly or unsafe but often struggles with high epistemic uncertainty due to
limited data. Existing methods rely on fixed conservative policies, restricting
adaptivity and generalization. To address this, we propose Reflect-then-Plan
(RefPlan), a novel doubly Bayesian offline model-based (MB) planning approach.
RefPlan unifies uncertainty modeling and MB planning by recasting planning as
Bayesian posterior estimation. At deployment, it updates a belief over
environment dynamics using real-time observations, incorporating uncertainty
into MB planning via marginalization. Empirical results on standard benchmarks
show that RefPlan significantly improves the performance of conservative
offline RL policies. In particular, RefPlan maintains robust performance under
high epistemic uncertainty and limited data, while demonstrating resilience to
changing environment dynamics, improving the flexibility, generalizability, and
robustness of offline-learned policies.

Result: 提出了一种可扩展的概率安全验证框架，为大规模AI系统部署提供了可行的安全保证。

Conclusion: 通过概率安全边界，论文为安全关键领域的AI系统部署提供了理论和实践之间的桥梁。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are
increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system
failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a
major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in
safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and
robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system
safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity
and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable
embodied AI systems. To address this challenge, we introduce provable
probabilistic safety, which aims to ensure that the residual risk of
large-scale deployment remains below a predefined threshold. Instead of
attempting exhaustive safety proof across all corner cases, this paradigm
establishes a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance,
leveraging statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability. A
well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be
deployed at scale while allowing for continuous refinement of safety
guarantees. Our work focuses on three core questions: what is provable
probabilistic safety, how to prove the probabilistic safety, and how to achieve
the provable probabilistic safety. By bridging the gap between theoretical
safety assurance and practical deployment, our work offers a pathway toward
safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical
applications.

Abstract: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generation holds significant promise for
automating cloud infrastructure provisioning. Recent advances in Large Language
Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by
generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language
descriptions, but current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while
ignoring deployability, the fatal measure of IaC template utility. We address
this gap through two contributions: (1) IaCGen, an LLM-based
deployability-centric framework that uses iterative feedback mechanism to
generate IaC templates, and (2) DPIaC-Eval, a deployability-centric IaC
template benchmark consists of 153 real-world scenarios that can evaluate
syntax, deployment, user intent, and security. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art LLMs initially performed poorly, with Claude-3.5 and
Claude-3.7 achieving only 30.2% and 26.8% deployment success on the first
attempt respectively. However, IaCGen transforms this performance dramatically:
all evaluated models reach over 90% passItr@25, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7
achieving 98% success rate. Despite these improvements, critical challenges
remain in user intent alignment (25.2% accuracy) and security compliance (8.4%
pass rate), highlighting areas requiring continued research. Our work provides
the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC template
generation and establishes a foundation for future research.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of fintech, personalized financial product
recommendations have become increasingly important. Traditional methods like
collaborative filtering or content-based models often fail to capture users'

integrating large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). A
pre-trained LLM encodes text data (e.g., user reviews) into rich feature
vectors, while a heterogeneous user-product graph models interactions and
social ties. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, text and graph
information are fused within the GNN to jointly optimize embeddings.
Experiments on public and real-world financial datasets show our model
outperforms standalone LLM or GNN in accuracy, recall, and NDCG, with strong
interpretability. This work offers new insights for personalized financial
recommendations and cross-modal fusion in broader recommendation tasks.

force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator
coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures
robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning,

discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in
stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models

Conclusion: 轨迹熵有效改进了层次k博弈框架，提升了自动驾驶任务的性能。

Abstract: Complex interactions among agents present a significant challenge for
autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. Recently, a promising approach has
emerged, which formulates the interactions of agents as a level-k game
framework. It effectively decouples agent policies by hierarchical game levels.
However, this framework ignores both the varying driving complexities among
agents and the dynamic changes in agent states across game levels, instead
treating them uniformly. Consequently, redundant and error-prone computations
are introduced into this framework. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a
metric, termed as Trajectory Entropy, to reveal the game status of agents
within the level-k game framework. The key insight stems from recognizing the
inherit relationship between agent policy uncertainty and the associated
driving complexity. Specifically, Trajectory Entropy extracts statistical
signals representing uncertainty from the multimodality trajectory prediction
results of agents in the game. Then, the signal-to-noise ratio of this signal
is utilized to quantify the game status of agents. Based on the proposed
Trajectory Entropy, we refine the current level-k game framework through a
simple gating mechanism, significantly improving overall accuracy while
reducing computational costs. Our method is evaluated on the Waymo and nuPlan
datasets, in terms of trajectory prediction, open-loop and closed-loop planning
tasks. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with precision improved by up to 19.89% for prediction and up to 16.48% for
planning.

prioritize one criterion at the expense of others. We propose ECLIPSE, a novel
attack method employing Gaussian blurring on sampled gradients and a local
surrogate model. Comprehensive experiments on a public dataset highlight
ECLIPSE's advantages, demonstrating its contribution to the trade-off between

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been successfully applied in industry for

deployment environment. However, high complexity and low readability in some
deployment environments make the application of these methods to be costly or
raise safety concerns. In order to ease the MAS organization design regarding
those concerns, we introduce an original Assisted MAS Organization Engineering
Approach (AOMEA). AOMEA relies on combining a Multi-Agent Reinforcement

Abstract: Scenario building is an established method to anticipate the future of
emerging technologies. Its primary goal is to use narratives to map future
trajectories of technology development and sociotechnical adoption. Following
this process, risks and benefits can be identified early on, and strategies can
be developed that strive for desirable futures. In recent years, computer
science has adopted this method and applied it to various technologies,
including Artificial Intelligence (AI). Because computing technologies play
such an important role in shaping modern societies, it is worth exploring how
scenarios are being used as an anticipatory tool in the field -- and what
possible traditional uses of scenarios are not yet covered but have the
potential to enrich the field. We address this gap by conducting a systematic
literature review on the use of scenario building methods in computer science
over the last decade (n = 59). We guide the review along two main questions.
First, we aim to uncover how scenarios are used in computing literature,
focusing especially on the rationale for why scenarios are used. Second, in
following the potential of scenario building to enhance inclusivity in
research, we dive deeper into the participatory element of the existing
scenario building literature in computer science.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning technology, pre-trained encoder
models have demonstrated exceptional feature extraction capabilities, playing a
pivotal role in the research and application of deep learning. However, their
widespread use has raised significant concerns about the risk of training data
privacy leakage. This paper systematically investigates the privacy threats
posed by membership inference attacks (MIAs) targeting encoder models, focusing
on contrastive learning frameworks. Through experimental analysis, we reveal
the significant impact of model architecture complexity on membership privacy
leakage: As more advanced encoder frameworks improve feature-extraction
performance, they simultaneously exacerbate privacy-leakage risks. Furthermore,
this paper proposes a novel membership inference attack method based on the
p-norm of feature vectors, termed the Embedding Lp-Norm Likelihood Attack
(LpLA). This method infers membership status, by leveraging the statistical
distribution characteristics of the p-norm of feature vectors. Experimental
results across multiple datasets and model architectures demonstrate that LpLA
outperforms existing methods in attack performance and robustness, particularly
under limited attack knowledge and query volumes. This study not only uncovers
the potential risks of privacy leakage in contrastive learning frameworks, but
also provides a practical basis for privacy protection research in encoder
models. We hope that this work will draw greater attention to the privacy risks
associated with self-supervised learning models and shed light on the
importance of a balance between model utility and training data privacy. Our

Conclusion: 研究为音频-视频DeepFake检测领域提供了新的基准测试方法和改进方向。

Abstract: Generative AI advances rapidly, allowing the creation of very realistic
manipulated video and audio. This progress presents a significant security and
ethical threat, as malicious users can exploit DeepFake techniques to spread
misinformation. Recent DeepFake detection approaches explore the multimodal
(audio-video) threat scenario. In particular, there is a lack of
reproducibility and critical issues with existing datasets - such as the
recently uncovered silence shortcut in the widely used FakeAVCeleb dataset.
Considering the importance of this topic, we aim to gain a deeper understanding
of the key issues affecting benchmarking in audio-video DeepFake detection. We
examine these challenges through the lens of the three core benchmarking
pillars: datasets, detection methods, and evaluation protocols. To address
these issues, we spotlight the recent DeepSpeak v1 dataset and are the first to
propose an evaluation protocol and benchmark it using SOTA models. We introduce
SImple Multimodal BAseline (SIMBA), a competitive yet minimalistic approach
that enables the exploration of diverse design choices. We also deepen insights
into the issue of audio shortcuts and present a promising mitigation strategy.
Finally, we analyze and enhance the evaluation scheme on the widely used
FakeAVCeleb dataset. Our findings offer a way forward in the complex area of
audio-video DeepFake detection.

Conclusion: 讨价还价视角为长期说服提供了结构化解决方案，并通过实验验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Bayesian persuasion, an extension of cheap-talk communication, involves an
informed sender committing to a signaling scheme to influence a receiver's
actions. Compared to cheap talk, this sender's commitment enables the receiver
to verify the incentive compatibility of signals beforehand, facilitating
cooperation. While effective in one-shot scenarios, Bayesian persuasion faces
computational complexity (NP-hardness) when extended to long-term interactions,
where the receiver may adopt dynamic strategies conditional on past outcomes
and future expectations. To address this complexity, we introduce the
bargaining perspective, which allows: (1) a unified framework and
well-structured solution concept for long-term persuasion, with desirable
properties such as fairness and Pareto efficiency; (2) a clear distinction
between two previously conflated advantages: the sender's informational
advantage and first-proposer advantage. With only modest modifications to the
standard setting, this perspective makes explicit the common knowledge of the
game structure and grants the receiver comparable commitment capabilities,
thereby reinterpreting classic one-sided persuasion as a balanced information
bargaining framework. The framework is validated through a two-stage
validation-and-inference paradigm: We first demonstrate that GPT-o3 and
DeepSeek-R1, out of publicly available LLMs, reliably handle standard tasks; We
then apply them to persuasion scenarios to test that the outcomes align with
what our information-bargaining framework suggests. All code, results, and
terminal logs are publicly available at

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了零样本物体导航的性能和效率。

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments
coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant
decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene
information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we
proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes
Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success
rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with
SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space
regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR
is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding
the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene
mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of
28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing
absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

Conclusion: 最优传输正则化对跨模态对齐至关重要，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Mean Opinion Score (MOS) prediction for text to music systems requires
evaluating both overall musical quality and text prompt alignment. This paper
introduces WhisQ, a multimodal architecture that addresses this dual-assessment
challenge through sequence level co-attention and optimal transport
regularization. WhisQ employs the Whisper Base pretrained model for temporal
audio encoding and Qwen 3, a 0.6B Small Language Model (SLM), for text
encoding, with both maintaining sequence structure for fine grained cross-modal
modeling. The architecture features specialized prediction pathways: OMQ is
predicted from pooled audio embeddings, while TA leverages bidirectional
sequence co-attention between audio and text. Sinkhorn optimal transport loss
further enforce semantic alignment in the shared embedding space. On the
MusicEval Track-1 dataset, WhisQ achieves substantial improvements over the
baseline: 7% improvement in Spearman correlation for OMQ and 14% for TA.
Ablation studies reveal that optimal transport regularization provides the
largest performance gain (10% SRCC improvement), demonstrating the importance
of explicit cross-modal alignment for text-to-music evaluation.

Abstract: Watermarking becomes one of the pivotal solutions to trace and verify the
origin of synthetic images generated by artificial intelligence models, but it
is not free of risks. Recent studies demonstrate the capability to forge
watermarks from a target image onto cover images via adversarial optimization
without knowledge of the target generative model and watermark schemes. In this
paper, we uncover a greater risk of an optimization-free and universal
watermark forgery that harnesses existing regenerative diffusion models. Our
proposed forgery attack, PnP (Plug-and-Plant), seamlessly extracts and
integrates the target watermark via regenerating the image, without needing any
additional optimization routine. It allows for universal watermark forgery that
works independently of the target image's origin or the watermarking model
used. We explore the watermarked latent extracted from the target image and
visual-textual context of cover images as priors to guide sampling of the
regenerative process. Extensive evaluation on 24 scenarios of
model-data-watermark combinations demonstrates that PnP can successfully forge
the watermark (up to 100% detectability and user attribution), and maintain the
best visual perception. By bypassing model retraining and enabling adaptability
to any image, our approach significantly broadens the scope of forgery attacks,
presenting a greater challenge to the security of current watermarking
techniques for diffusion models and the authority of watermarking schemes in
synthetic data generation and governance.

stigmergy, a collective intelligence mechanism that surfaces useful paths
through repeated engagement. While generally effective, this

over-reliance on popularity fosters intellectual homogeneity and exacerbates
structural inequities, stifling innovative and diverse perspectives critical
for scientific progress. We propose an overhaul of search platforms to
incorporate user-specific calibration, allowing researchers to manually adjust
the weights of factors like popularity, recency, and relevance. We also advise
platform developers on how word embeddings and LLMs could be implemented in
ways that increase user autonomy. While our suggestions are particularly
pertinent to aligning recommender systems with scientific values, these ideas
are broadly applicable to information access systems in general. Designing
platforms that increase user autonomy is an important step toward more robust

Abstract: While the complexity of 21st-century demands has promoted pedagogical
approaches to foster complex competencies, a persistent gap remains between
in-class learning activities and individualized learning or assessment
practices. To address this, studies have explored the use of AI-generated
characters in learning and assessment. One attempt is scenario-based assessment
(SBA), a technique that not only measures but also fosters the development of
competencies throughout the assessment process. SBA introduces simulated agents
to provide an authentic social-interactional context, allowing for the
assessment of competency-based constructs while mitigating the unpredictability
of real-life interactions. Recent advancements in multimodal AI, such as
text-to-video technology, allow these agents to be enhanced into AI-generated
characters. This mixed-method study investigates how learners perceive AI
characters taking the role of mentor and teammates in an SBA mirroring the
context of a collaborative science investigation. Specifically, we examined the
Likert scale responses of 56 high schoolers regarding trust, social presence,
and effectiveness. We analyzed the relationships between these factors and
their impact on the intention to adopt AI characters through PLS-SEM. Our
findings indicated that learners' trust shaped their sense of social presence
with the AI characters, enhancing perceived effectiveness. Qualitative analysis
further highlighted factors that foster trust, such as material credibility and
alignment with learning goals, as well as the pivotal role of social presence
in creating a collaborative context.

spatial-temporal encoder, trained through self-supervised learning, generates
robust 4D features for downstream tasks. The planning head utilizes flow
matching and a novel masked ESDF loss to minimize collision risks for

adults through a chatbot named Litti, evaluating its impact on their AI
literacy (knowledge, safety, and ethical use). The quantitative data indicated
a trend toward improved AI literacy, though the results were not statistically

business success, transforming them from passive tools into active drivers of
organizational growth. BSDS has a modular architecture that comprises curated
data linked to business entities, a knowledge base for context-aware AI agents,
and efficient data pipelines. AI agents play a pivotal role in assisting with
data access and system management, reducing human effort, and improving
scalability. Complementing this architecture, BSDS incorporates workflows
optimized for both exploratory data analysis and production requirements,
balancing speed of delivery with quality assurance. A key innovation of BSDS is
its incorporation of the human factor. By aligning data team expertise with
business semantics, BSDS bridges the gap between technical capabilities and
business needs. Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates
time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional

Abstract: Large-scale itinerary planning is a variant of the traveling salesman
problem, aiming to determine an optimal path that maximizes the collected
points of interest (POIs) scores while minimizing travel time and cost, subject
to travel duration constraints. This paper analyzes the decomposability of
large-scale itinerary planning, proving that strict decomposability is
difficult to satisfy, and introduces a weak decomposability definition based on
a necessary condition, deriving the corresponding graph structures that fulfill
this property. With decomposability guaranteed, we propose a novel
multi-objective cooperative coevolutionary algorithm for large-scale itinerary
planning, addressing the challenges of component imbalance and interactions.
Specifically, we design a dynamic decomposition strategy based on the
normalized fitness within each component, define optimization potential
considering component scale and contribution, and develop a computational
resource allocation strategy. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a
set of real-world datasets. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art
multi-objective itinerary planning algorithms demonstrate the superiority of
our approach, with performance advantages increasing as the problem scale

Abstract: Lack of input data for in-the-wild activities often results in low

particularly pronounced in uncommon human-centric domains like sports, where
real-world data collection is complex and impractical. While synthetic datasets

their reliance on rigid asset libraries and hand-crafted rendering pipelines.
To address this, we introduce Gen4D, a fully automated pipeline for generating
diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations. Gen4D integrates expert-driven
motion encoding, prompt-guided avatar generation using diffusion-based Gaussian
splatting, and human-aware background synthesis to produce highly varied and

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) serves as a fundamental technique for
various software engineering tasks, e.g., vulnerability detection and
classification. Attacks against such models have therefore drawn extensive
attention, aiming at misleading the models to generate erroneous predictions.
Prior works have explored various approaches to generating semantic-preserving
variants, i.e., adversarial samples, to evaluate the robustness of the models
against adversarial attacks. However, they have mainly relied on heuristic
criteria or iterative greedy algorithms to locate salient code influencing the
model output, failing to operate on a solid theoretical basis. Moreover, when
processing programs with high complexities, such attacks tend to be
time-consuming.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization for adversarial attacks against
BCSD models. In particular, we aim to improve the attacks in a challenging
scenario, where the attack goal is to limit the model predictions to a specific
range, i.e., the targeted attacks. Our attack leverages the superior capability
of black-box, model-agnostic explainers in interpreting the model decision
boundaries, thereby pinpointing the critical code snippet to apply
semantic-preserving perturbations. The evaluation results demonstrate that
compared with the state-of-the-art attacks, the proposed attacks achieve higher
attack success rate in almost all scenarios, while also improving the
efficiency and transferability. Our real-world case studies on vulnerability
detection and classification further demonstrate the security implications of
our attacks, highlighting the urgent need to further enhance the robustness of
existing BCSD models.

Motivation: 新冠疫情导致教育模式转向在线学习，非语言沟通的缺失降低了教育效果，因此需要新的方法（如情感分析）来理解学生反馈的情感背景。

Method: 研究包括数据准备、特征选择，以及开发一个结合词嵌入、LSTM和注意力机制的深度神经网络模型，并与逻辑回归基线进行比较。

Result: 该模型能够更有效地理解学生反馈的情感背景，为在线教育中的师生沟通提供新途径。

Conclusion: 情感分析可以改善在线教育中的师生沟通，提升教育质量。

Abstract: During the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the educational paradigm has
experienced a major change from in person learning traditional to online
platforms. The change of learning convention has impacted the teacher-student
especially in non-verbal communication. The absent of non-verbal communication
has led to a reliance on verbal feedback which diminished the efficacy of the
educational experience. This paper explores the integration of sentiment
analysis into learning management systems (LMS) to bridge the student-teacher's
gap by offering an alternative approach to interpreting student feedback beyond
its verbal context. The research involves data preparation, feature selection,
and the development of a deep neural network model encompassing word embedding,
LSTM, and attention mechanisms. This model is compared against a logistic
regression baseline to evaluate its efficacy in understanding student feedback.
The study aims to bridge the communication gap between instructors and students
in online learning environments, offering insights into the emotional context
of student feedback and ultimately improving the quality of online education.

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end approaches have made notable progress in
addressing the challenge of speaker diarization, which involves segmenting and
identifying speakers in multi-talker recordings. One such approach,
Encoder-Decoder Attractors (EDA), has been proposed to handle variable speaker
counts as well as better guide the network during training. In this study, we
extend the attractor paradigm by moving beyond direct speaker modeling and
instead focus on representing more detailed `speaker attributes' through a
multi-stage process of intermediate representations. Additionally, we enhance
the architecture by replacing transformers with conformers, a
convolution-augmented transformer, to model local dependencies. Experiments
demonstrate improved diarization performance on the CALLHOME dataset.

Abstract: As generative AI tools become increasingly integrated into higher education,
understanding how students interact with and perceive these technologies is
essential for responsible and effective adoption. This study evaluates the use
of the Educational AI Hub, an AI-powered learning framework, in undergraduate
civil and environmental engineering courses at a large R1 public university.
Using a mixed-methods approach that combines pre- and post-surveys, system
usage logs, and qualitative analysis of the open-ended prompts and questions
students posed to the AI chatbot, the research explores students' perceptions
of trust, ethical concerns, usability, and learning outcomes. Findings reveal
that students appreciated the AI assistant for its convenience and comfort,
with nearly half reporting greater ease in using the AI tool compared to
seeking help from instructors or teaching assistants. The tool was seen as most
helpful for completing homework and understanding course concepts, though
perceptions of its instructional quality were mixed. Ethical concerns emerged
as a key barrier to full engagement: while most students viewed AI use as
ethically acceptable, many expressed uncertainties about institutional policies
and apprehension about potential academic misconduct. This study contributes to
the growing body of research on AI in education by highlighting the importance
of usability, policy clarity, and faculty guidance in fostering meaningful AI
engagement. The findings suggest that while students are ready to embrace AI as
a supplement to human instruction, thoughtful integration and transparent
institutional frameworks are critical for ensuring student confidence, trust,

Conclusion: 该方法为分类、预测、参数拟合和预测提供了新途径。

Abstract: Physics has been transforming our view of nature for centuries. While
combining physical knowledge with computational approaches has enabled detailed
modeling of physical systems' evolution, understanding the emergence of
patterns and structures remains limited. Correlations between quantities are
the most reliable approach to describe relationships between different
variables. However, for complex patterns, directly searching for correlations
is often impractical, as complexity and spatial inhomogeneity can obscure
correlations. We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local
regions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract
such correlations and represent them in phase space. When multiple observations
are available, a useful way to study a system is to analyze distributions in
phase space using the Probability Density Function (PDF). Adjacent correlation
analysis evaluates vectors representing local correlations, which can be
overlaid on the PDF plot to form the adjacent correlation plot. These
correlation vectors often exhibit remarkably regular patterns and may lead to
the discovery of new laws. The vectors we derive are equivalent to the vector
field in dynamical systems on the attracting manifold. By efficiently
representing spatial patterns as correlation vectors in phase space, our
approach opens avenues for classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and
forecasting.

Conclusion: FPDANet在胎儿超声图像分类任务中表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability
to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation.
However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and
lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not
effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task,
and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high
similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale
information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges.
Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which
utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different
spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In
addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to
capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales,
thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification
results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively,
and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of
FPDANet.

Abstract: This work lays the foundations for a rigorous ontological characterization of
love, addressing its philosophical complexity and scientific relevance, with
particular emphasis on psychology and sociology, as well as highlighting ways
in which such characterization enhances relevant AI based applications. The
position defended here is that love is best understood as a concatenation of
passive sensations (e.g., emotional arousal) and active evaluative judgments
(e.g., perceiving the beloved as valuable), in the interest of balancing the
involuntary aspects of love with its rational accountability. To provide a
structured foundation, the paper draws on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and other
applied ontological methods to differentiate various senses of love. This work
engages with objections to the understanding of love as concatenation,
particularly concerning the relationship between sensation and judgment. A
causal correlation model is defended, ensuring that the affective and cognitive
components are linked. By offering a precise and scalable ontological account,
this work lays the foundation for future interdisciplinary applications, making
love a subject of formal inquiry in ontology engineering, artificial
intelligence, and the sciences.

Abstract: With the integration of renewable sources in electricity distribution
networks, the need to develop intelligent mechanisms for balancing the energy
market has arisen. In the absence of such mechanisms, the energy market may
face imbalances that can lead to power outages, financial losses or instability
at the grid level. In this context, the grouping of microgrids into optimal
coalitions that can absorb energy from the market during periods of surplus or
supply energy to the market during periods of is a key aspect in the efficient
management of distribution networks. In this article, we propose a method that
identify an optimal microgrids coalition capable of addressing the dynamics of
the energy market. The proposed method models the problem of identifying the
optimal coalition as an optimization problem that it solves by combining a
strategy inspired by cooperative game theory with a memetic algorithm. An
individual is represented as a coalition of microgrids and the evolution of
population of individuals over generations is assured by recombination and
mutation. The fitness function is defined as the difference between the total
value generated by the coalition and a penalty applied to the coalition when
the energy traded by coalition exceeds the energy available/demanded on/by the
energy market. The value generated by the coalition is calculated based on the
profit obtained by the collation if it sells energy on the market during
periods of deficit or the savings obtained by the coalition if it buys energy
on the market during periods of surplus and the costs associated with the
trading process. This value is divided equitably among the coalition members,
according to the Shapley value, which considers the contribution of each one to
the formation of collective value.

Result: BAQ在相同位宽下比GPTQ降低困惑度高达56倍，适用于125M至30B参数的LLM。

Conclusion: BAQ通过优化位宽分配显著提升量化效果，理论分析支持其性能优势。

Abstract: Post-training model quantization is a widely adopted technique for reducing
the memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). However,
most existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,
failing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization
noise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization
bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make
key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this
paper are available at https://github.com/CSU-ModelCompression/BAQ.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers excel at text processing,
but their reliance on prompts for specialized behavior introduces computational
overhead. We propose a modification to a Transformer architecture that
eliminates the need for explicit prompts by learning to encode context into the
model's weights. Our Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) model maintains a
contextual summary at each sequence position, allowing it to update the weights
on the fly based on the preceding context. This approach enables the model to
self-specialize, effectively creating a tailored model for processing
information following a given prefix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on synthetic in-context learning tasks and language modeling benchmarks.
Furthermore, we introduce techniques for enhancing the interpretability of the

TL;DR: 提出一种低成本、高效的RLHF方法，通过冻结的7B LLM、JSON规则和LoRA适配器替代传统重型奖励模型，在RewardBench上达到96.2%准确率，并在在线RLHF中实现新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF中奖励模型训练的高成本问题，提出一种轻量级替代方案。

Method: 使用冻结的7B LLM，结合JSON规则和LoRA适配器（仅影响0.8%参数），无需离线阶段。

Result: RewardBench准确率96.2%，超越27B-70B奖励模型；7B模型在GSM-8K上达到92%准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法低成本、透明且高效，为RLHF提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward-model training is the cost bottleneck in modern Reinforcement Learning
Human Feedback (RLHF) pipelines, often requiring tens of billions of parameters
and an offline preference-tuning phase. In the proposed method, a frozen,
instruction-tuned 7B LLM is augmented with only a one line JSON rubric and a
rank-16 LoRA adapter (affecting just 0.8% of the model's parameters), enabling
it to serve as a complete substitute for the previously used heavyweight
evaluation models. The plug-and-play judge achieves 96.2% accuracy on
RewardBench, outperforming specialized reward networks ranging from 27B to 70B
parameters. Additionally, it allows a 7B actor to outperform the top 70B DPO
baseline, which scores 61.8%, by achieving 92% exact match accuracy on GSM-8K
utilizing online PPO. Thorough ablations indicate that (i) six in context
demonstrations deliver the majority of the zero-to-few-shot improvements
(+2pp), and (ii) the LoRA effectively addresses the remaining disparity,
particularly in the safety and adversarial Chat-Hard segments. The proposed
model introduces HH-Rationales, a subset of 10,000 pairs from Anthropic
HH-RLHF, to examine interpretability, accompanied by human generated
justifications. GPT-4 scoring indicates that our LoRA judge attains
approximately = 9/10 in similarity to human explanations, while zero-shot
judges score around =5/10. These results indicate that the combination of
prompt engineering and tiny LoRA produces a cost effective, transparent, and
easily adjustable reward function, removing the offline phase while achieving
new state-of-the-art outcomes for both static evaluation and online RLHF.

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for adapting RL agents to downstream tasks through prompt conditioning.
However, two notable challenges remain in fully harnessing in-context learning
within RL domains: the intrinsic multi-modality of the state-action-reward data
and the diverse, heterogeneous nature of decision tasks. To tackle these
challenges, we propose \textbf{T2MIR} (\textbf{T}oken- and \textbf{T}ask-wise
\textbf{M}oE for \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{R}L), an innovative framework that
introduces architectural advances of mixture-of-experts (MoE) into
transformer-based decision models. T2MIR substitutes the feedforward layer with
two parallel layers: a token-wise MoE that captures distinct semantics of input
tokens across multiple modalities, and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse
tasks to specialized experts for managing a broad task distribution with
alleviated gradient conflicts. To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a
contrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the
task and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of
task-relevant information. The outputs of two MoE components are concatenated
and fed into the next layer. Comprehensive experiments show that T2MIR
significantly facilitates in-context learning capacity and outperforms various
types of baselines. We bring the potential and promise of MoE to ICRL, offering
a simple and scalable architectural enhancement to advance ICRL one step closer
toward achievements in language and vision communities. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs参数量巨大，边缘部署面临挑战。现有向量量化方法通常耦合量化方向与幅度，但方向对量化更敏感，导致精度下降。

Method: 提出PCDVQ框架：1) 极坐标解耦（PCD），独立量化方向与幅度；2) 分布对齐码本构建（DACC），优化码本以匹配源分布。

Result: 在2-bit量化水平下，PCDVQ比基线方法至少提升1.5%的零样本准确率。

Conclusion: PCDVQ为高精度压缩LLMs提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in edge deployment
due to their massive parameter scale. Vector Quantization (VQ), a
clustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this
issue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.
Since a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction
and magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.
However, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to
quantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately
clustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the
accuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\% and 2.3\%, respectively. This gap
even increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean
distance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works,
places greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is
contrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization
errors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector
Quantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two
key modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors
into their polar coordinate representations and perform independent
quantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned
Codebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude
codebooks in accordance with the source distribution. Experimental results show
that PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods at 2-bit level by at least 1.5\%
zero-shot accuracy, establishing a novel paradigm for accurate and highly
compressed LLMs.

Motivation: GRPO在长共享前缀场景下计算冗余，成为可扩展性瓶颈，需要更高效的训练方法。

Method: 提出Shared-Prefix Forward策略，将自注意力分为两部分，共享前缀仅编码一次，保持端到端训练兼容性。

Result: Prefix Grouper与标准GRPO训练等效，显著降低计算成本，支持更大组规模。

Conclusion: Prefix Grouper是一种即插即用的高效GRPO替代方案，提升复杂任务和大模型的可扩展性。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhances policy learning by
computing gradients from relative comparisons among candidate outputs that
share a common input prefix. Despite its effectiveness, GRPO introduces
substantial computational overhead when processing long shared prefixes, which
must be redundantly encoded for each group member. This inefficiency becomes a
major scalability bottleneck in long-context learning scenarios. We propose
Prefix Grouper, an efficient GRPO training algorithm that eliminates redundant
prefix computation via a Shared-Prefix Forward strategy. In particular, by
restructuring self-attention into two parts, our method enables the shared
prefix to be encoded only once, while preserving full differentiability and
compatibility with end-to-end training. We provide both theoretical and
empirical evidence that Prefix Grouper is training-equivalent to standard GRPO:
it yields identical forward outputs and backward gradients, ensuring that the
optimization dynamics and final policy performance remain unchanged.
Empirically, our experiments confirm that Prefix Grouper achieves consistent
results while significantly reducing the computational cost of training,
particularly in long-prefix scenarios. The proposed method is fully
plug-and-play: it is compatible with existing GRPO-based architectures and can
be seamlessly integrated into current training pipelines as a drop-in
replacement, requiring no structural modifications and only minimal changes to
input construction and attention computation. Prefix Grouper enables the use of
larger group sizes under the same computational budget, thereby improving the
scalability of GRPO to more complex tasks and larger models. Code is now

Conclusion: DoSAC通过因果干预有效解决了隐藏混杂变量问题，为强化学习提供了更可靠的策略学习方法。

Abstract: Hidden confounders that influence both states and actions can bias policy
learning in reinforcement learning (RL), leading to suboptimal or
non-generalizable behavior. Most RL algorithms ignore this issue, learning
policies from observational trajectories based solely on statistical
associations rather than causal effects. We propose DoSAC (Do-Calculus Soft
Actor-Critic with Backdoor Adjustment), a principled extension of the SAC
algorithm that corrects for hidden confounding via causal intervention
estimation. DoSAC estimates the interventional policy $\pi(a | \mathrm{do}(s))$
using the backdoor criterion, without requiring access to true confounders or
causal labels. To achieve this, we introduce a learnable Backdoor Reconstructor
that infers pseudo-past variables (previous state and action) from the current
state to enable backdoor adjustment from observational data. This module is
integrated into a soft actor-critic framework to compute both the
interventional policy and its entropy. Empirical results on continuous control
benchmarks show that DoSAC outperforms baselines under confounded settings,
with improved robustness, generalization, and policy reliability.

Conclusion: 损失减速和ZSL为语言模型扩展定律提供了新的视角，可能成为独立于模型规模改进语言模型的新方向。

Abstract: This work aims to understand how scaling improves language models,
specifically in terms of training dynamics. We find that language models
undergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of
loss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in
log-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing
the loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of
loss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type
of degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL,
per-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive
interference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one
subset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss
deceleration and ZSL provide new insights into the training dynamics underlying
language model scaling laws, and could potentially be targeted directly to
improve language models independent of scale. We make our code and artefacts

Result: 实验表明，CPQ适用于任何黑盒LLM，能生成比现有方法更信息丰富的预测集。

Conclusion: CPQ为语言模型的不确定性量化提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for safe deployment of
generative AI models such as large language models (LLMs), especially in high
stakes applications. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a principled uncertainty
quantification framework, but classical methods focus on regression and
classification, relying on geometric distances or softmax scores: tools that
presuppose structured outputs. We depart from this paradigm by studying CP in a
query only setting, where prediction sets must be constructed solely from
finite queries to a black box generative model, introducing a new trade off
between coverage, test time query budget, and informativeness. We introduce
Conformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a framework characterizing the
optimal interplay between these objectives. Our finite sample algorithm is
built on two core principles: one governs the optimal query policy, and the
other defines the optimal mapping from queried samples to prediction sets.
Remarkably, both are rooted in the classical missing mass problem in
statistics. Specifically, the optimal query policy depends on the rate of
decay, or the derivative, of the missing mass, for which we develop a novel
estimator. Meanwhile, the optimal mapping hinges on the missing mass itself,
which we estimate using Good Turing estimators. We then turn our focus to
implementing our method for language models, where outputs are vast, variable,
and often under specified. Fine grained experiments on three real world open
ended tasks and two LLMs, show CPQ applicability to any black box LLM and
highlight: (1) individual contribution of each principle to CPQ performance,
and (2) CPQ ability to yield significantly more informative prediction sets
than existing conformal methods for language uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have not yet effectively leveraged the vast
amounts of edge-device data, and federated learning (FL) offers a promising
paradigm to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without transferring private edge
data to the cloud. To operate within the computation and communication
constraints of edge devices, recent literature on federated fine-tuning of LLMs
proposes the use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and similar parameter-efficient
methods. However, LoRA-based methods suffer from accuracy degradation in FL
settings, primarily because of data and computational heterogeneity across
clients. We propose \textsc{Ravan}, an adaptive multi-head LoRA method that
balances parameter efficiency and model expressivity by reparameterizing the
weight updates as the sum of multiple LoRA heads
$s_i\textbf{B}_i\textbf{H}_i\textbf{A}_i$ in which only the core matrices
$\textbf{H}_i$ and their lightweight scaling factors $s_i$ are trained. These
trainable scaling factors let the optimization focus on the most useful heads,
recovering a higher-rank approximation of the full update without increasing
the number of communicated parameters since clients upload $s_i\textbf{H}_i$
directly. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that
\textsc{Ravan} improves test accuracy by 2-8\% over prior parameter-efficient
baselines, making it a robust and scalable solution for federated fine-tuning
of LLMs.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained
transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only
a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the
pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize
\emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct
tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of
task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear
functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a
transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the
pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of
distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the
solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and
observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a
phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with
the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as
the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem
influence the transition.

By making this transformation task-specific, we aim to capture a narrower scope

determines the strength of temporal dependence. This setup allows us to produce

four representative memory functions, each corresponding to a distinct class of
temporal structures.Experiments on several sequence modeling architectures

stochastically deactivating adapters, CoTo encourages more balanced
optimization and broader exploration of the loss landscape. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that CoTo promotes layer-wise dropout stability

quantify each adapter's marginal contribution. Extensive experiments

clarity and apply existing statistical methods on the evaluation. In addition,
we propose two simple sanity checks on the evaluation metrics and show that
many commonly used metrics fail these tests and do not change their score after
massive changes to the concept labels. Based on our experimental and

actions, which generally model the optimal value function using the Bellman
optimality operator, RL algorithms for continuous actions typically model
Q-values for the current policy using the Bellman operator. These algorithms
for continuous actions rely exclusively on policy updates for improvement,
which often results in low sample efficiency. This study examines the
effectiveness of incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into
actor-critic frameworks. Experiments in a simple environment show that modeling
optimal values accelerates learning but leads to overestimation bias. To
address this, we propose an annealing approach that gradually transitions from
the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, thereby accelerating
learning while mitigating bias. Our method, combined with TD3 and SAC,
significantly outperforms existing approaches across various locomotion and
manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved performance and robustness to
hyperparameters related to optimality.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FedFT) of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as
a promising solution for adapting models to distributed data environments while
ensuring data privacy.
  Existing FedFT methods predominantly utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques to reduce communication and computation overhead.
  However, they often fail to adequately address the catastrophic forgetting, a
critical challenge arising from continual adaptation in distributed
environments. The traditional centralized fine-tuning methods, which are not
designed for the heterogeneous and privacy-constrained nature of federated
environments, struggle to mitigate this issue effectively. Moreover, the
challenge is further exacerbated by significant variation in data distributions
and device capabilities across clients, which leads to intensified forgetting
and degraded model generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose FedBE, a
novel FedFT framework that integrates an adaptive transformer block expansion
mechanism with a dynamic trainable-block allocation strategy. Specifically,
FedBE expands trainable blocks within the model architecture, structurally
separating newly learned task-specific knowledge from the original pre-trained
representations. Additionally, FedBE dynamically assigns these trainable blocks
to clients based on their data distributions and computational capabilities.
This enables the framework to better accommodate heterogeneous federated
environments and enhances the generalization ability of the model.Extensive
experiments show that compared with existing federated fine-tuning methods,
FedBE achieves 12-74% higher accuracy retention on general tasks after
fine-tuning and a model convergence acceleration ratio of 1.9-3.1x without
degrading the accuracy of downstream tasks.

Abstract: A generalist agent must continuously learn and adapt throughout its lifetime,
achieving efficient forward transfer while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.
Previous work within the dominant pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning for single-task adaptation, effectively
steering a frozen pretrained model with a small number of parameters. However,
in the context of lifelong learning, these methods rely on the impractical
assumption of a test-time task identifier and restrict knowledge sharing among
isolated adapters. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Mixture of
Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library (DMPEL) for lifelong robot
learning. DMPEL progressively learn a low-rank expert library and employs a
lightweight router to dynamically combine experts into an end-to-end policy,
facilitating flexible behavior during lifelong adaptation. Moreover, by
leveraging the modular structure of the fine-tuned parameters, we introduce
coefficient replay to guide the router in accurately retrieving frozen experts
for previously encountered tasks, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
This method is significantly more storage- and computationally-efficient than
applying demonstration replay to the entire policy. Extensive experiments on
the lifelong manipulation benchmark LIBERO demonstrate that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods in success rates across
continual adaptation, while utilizing minimal trainable parameters and storage.

Conclusion: 人类-AI反馈循环可能导致信念固化和多样性丧失。

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality

Abstract: Large language models are popular around the world due to their powerful

Transformer through parallelization has gradually become a hot research topic.
Mask layers introduce sparsity into Transformer to reduce calculations.
However, previous works rarely focus on the performance optimization of sparse
Transformer. Moreover, rule-based mechanisms ignore the fusion opportunities of
mixed-type operators and fail to adapt to various sequence lengths. To address
the above problems, we propose STOF, a framework that incorporates
optimizations for Sparse Transformer via flexible masking and operator fusion
on GPU. We firstly unify the storage format and kernel implementation for the
multi-head attention. Then, we map fusion schemes to compilation templates and
determine the optimal parameter setting through a two-stage search engine. The

Abstract: While Foundation Models provide a general tool for rapid content creation,
they regularly require task-specific adaptation. Traditionally, this exercise
involves careful curation of datasets and repeated fine-tuning of the
underlying model. Fine-tuning techniques enable practitioners to adapt
foundation models for many new applications but require expensive and lengthy
training while being notably sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Text-to-LoRA (T2L), a model capable of adapting
Large Language Models on the fly solely based on a natural language description
of the target task. T2L is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a
single inexpensive forward pass. After training T2L on a suite of 9 pre-trained
LoRA adapters (GSM8K, Arc, etc.), we show that the ad-hoc reconstructed LoRA
instances match the performance of task-specific adapters across the
corresponding test sets. Furthermore, T2L can compress hundreds of LoRA
instances and zero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks. This approach
provides a significant step towards democratizing the specialization of
foundation models and enables language-based adaptation with minimal compute
requirements. Our code is available at https://github.com/SakanaAI/text-to-lora

Abstract: Self-attention has emerged as a core component of modern neural
architectures, yet its theoretical underpinnings remain elusive. In this paper,
we study self-attention through the lens of interacting entities, ranging from
agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning to alleles in genetic sequences,
and show that a single layer linear self-attention can efficiently represent,
learn, and generalize functions capturing pairwise interactions, including
out-of-distribution scenarios. Our analysis reveals that self-attention acts as
a mutual interaction learner under minimal assumptions on the diversity of
interaction patterns observed during training, thereby encompassing a wide
variety of real-world domains. In addition, we validate our theoretical
insights through experiments demonstrating that self-attention learns
interaction functions and generalizes across both population distributions and
out-of-distribution scenarios. Building on our theories, we introduce
HyperFeatureAttention, a novel neural network module designed to learn
couplings of different feature-level interactions between entities.
Furthermore, we propose HyperAttention, a new module that extends beyond
pairwise interactions to capture multi-entity dependencies, such as three-way,
four-way, or general n-way interactions.

Conclusion: UNDO为实际应用提供了一种高效鲁棒的遗忘方法，特别适用于能力移除场景。

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods are not robust: they can be reverted easily
with a few steps of finetuning. This is true even for the idealized unlearning
method of training to imitate an oracle model that was never exposed to
unwanted information, suggesting that output-based finetuning is insufficient
to achieve robust unlearning. In a similar vein, we find that training a
randomly initialized student to imitate an unlearned model transfers desired
behaviors while leaving undesired capabilities behind. In other words,
distillation robustifies unlearning. Building on this insight, we propose
Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an
unlearned model into a partially noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a
tunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto
frontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting,
UNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data
filtering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of
the pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies
unlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP)
benchmark. Since distillation is widely used in practice, incorporating an
unlearning step beforehand offers a convenient path to robust capability
removal.

Abstract: Foundation models represent the most prominent and recent paradigm shift in
artificial intelligence.Foundation models are large models, trained on broad
data that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without
fine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers
(ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications.
However, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces
significant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive
AI systems, jeopardizing their reliability.This paper studies the
vulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and
ViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream
tasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of
transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion.We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our attack on several downstream tasks: classification,
captioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation and depth estimation.

Abstract: While Transformers excel in language and vision-where inputs are semantically

complexity leads to diminishing returns in time series forecasting. Time series
data is characterized by low per-timestep information density and complex
dependencies across channels and covariates, requiring conditioning on
structured variable interactions. To address this mismatch and
overparameterization, we propose FaCTR, a lightweight spatiotemporal
Transformer with an explicitly structural design. FaCTR injects dynamic,
symmetric cross-channel interactions-modeled via a low-rank Factorization
Machine into temporally contextualized patch embeddings through a learnable
gating mechanism. It further encodes static and dynamic covariates for
multivariate conditioning. Despite its compact design, FaCTR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on eleven public forecasting benchmarks spanning
both short-term and long-term horizons, with its largest variant using close to
only 400K parameters-on average 50x smaller than competitive spatiotemporal
transformer baselines. In addition, its structured design enables
interpretability through cross-channel influence scores-an essential
requirement for real-world decision-making. Finally, FaCTR supports
self-supervised pretraining, positioning it as a compact yet versatile
foundation for downstream time series tasks.

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses sequential decision-making
problems where agents are required to achieve goals by maximizing the expected
return while meeting domain-specific constraints. In this setting, policy-based
methods are widely used thanks to their advantages when dealing with
continuous-control problems. These methods search in the policy space with an
action-based or a parameter-based exploration strategy, depending on whether
they learn the parameters of a stochastic policy or those of a stochastic
hyperpolicy. We introduce an exploration-agnostic algorithm, called C-PG, which
enjoys global last-iterate convergence guarantees under gradient domination
assumptions. Furthermore, under specific noise models where the (hyper)policy
is expressed as a stochastic perturbation of the actions or of the parameters
of an underlying deterministic policy, we additionally establish global
last-iterate convergence guarantees of C-PG to the optimal deterministic
policy. This holds when learning a stochastic (hyper)policy and subsequently
switching off the stochasticity at the end of training, thereby deploying a
deterministic policy. Finally, we empirically validate both the action-based
(C-PGAE) and parameter-based (C-PGPE) variants of C-PG on constrained control
tasks, and compare them against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating their
effectiveness, in particular when deploying deterministic policies after
training.

Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in
environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy.
Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill
diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously
optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new
method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill
Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both exploration and skill
diversification. We begin by conducting extensive ablation studies to identify
and define a set of objectives that effectively capture the aspects of
exploration and skill diversity, respectively. During the skill pretraining
phase, AMPED introduces a gradient surgery technique to balance the objectives
of exploration and skill diversity, mitigating conflicts and reducing reliance
on heuristic tuning. In the subsequent fine-tuning phase, AMPED incorporates a
skill selector module that dynamically selects suitable skills for downstream
tasks, based on task-specific performance signals. Our approach achieves
performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. These
results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and
diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and

Abstract: Membership inference tests aim to determine whether a particular data point
was included in a language model's training set. However, recent works have
shown that such tests often fail under the strict definition of membership
based on exact matching, and have suggested relaxing this definition to include
semantic neighbors as members as well. In this work, we show that membership
inference tests are still unreliable under this relaxation - it is possible to
poison the training dataset in a way that causes the test to produce incorrect
predictions for a target point. We theoretically reveal a trade-off between a
test's accuracy and its robustness to poisoning. We also present a concrete
instantiation of this poisoning attack and empirically validate its
effectiveness. Our results show that it can degrade the performance of existing
tests to well below random.

Motivation: 解决小语言模型在表格推理中的局限性，尤其是数值推理和布局适应性问题。

Method: 提出两阶段方法Table-r1：1）布局转换推理任务提升布局泛化能力；2）混合范式策略优化增强推理一致性。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，Table-r1显著优于其他SLM方法，性能接近大语言模型。

Conclusion: Table-r1为SLMs在表格推理任务中提供了高效解决方案，缩小了与LLMs的差距。

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.
Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all
SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base
model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with
LLMs.

Abstract: Fairness is a growing area of machine learning (ML) that focuses on ensuring
models do not produce systematically biased outcomes for specific groups,
particularly those defined by protected attributes such as race, gender, or
age. Evaluating fairness is a critical aspect of ML model development, as
biased models can perpetuate structural inequalities. The {fairmetrics} R
package offers a user-friendly framework for rigorously evaluating numerous
group-based fairness criteria, including metrics based on independence (e.g.,
statistical parity), separation (e.g., equalized odds), and sufficiency (e.g.,
predictive parity). Group-based fairness criteria assess whether a model is
equally accurate or well-calibrated across a set of predefined groups so that
appropriate bias mitigation strategies can be implemented. {fairmetrics}
provides both point and interval estimates for multiple metrics through a
convenient wrapper function and includes an example dataset derived from the
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version II (MIMIC-II) database
(Goldberger et al., 2000; Raffa, 2016).

Conclusion: lip-rcp为对抗攻击下的共形预测提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，同时扩展了传统CP的覆盖范围分析。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has proven to be an effective post-hoc method for
improving the trustworthiness of neural networks by providing prediction sets
with finite-sample guarantees. However, under adversarial attacks, classical
conformal guarantees do not hold anymore: this problem is addressed in the
field of Robust Conformal Prediction. Several methods have been proposed to
provide robust CP sets with guarantees under adversarial perturbations, but,
for large scale problems, these sets are either too large or the methods are
too computationally demanding to be deployed in real life scenarios. In this
work, we propose a new method that leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to
precisely and efficiently estimate robust CP sets. When combined with a
1-Lipschitz robust network, we demonstrate that our lip-rcp method outperforms
state-of-the-art results in both the size of the robust CP sets and
computational efficiency in medium and large-scale scenarios such as ImageNet.
Taking a different angle, we also study vanilla CP under attack, and derive new
worst-case coverage bounds of vanilla CP sets, which are valid simultaneously
for all adversarial attack levels. Our lip-rcp method makes this second
approach as efficient as vanilla CP while also allowing robustness guarantees.

Abstract: Agentic AI has gained significant interest as a research paradigm focused on
autonomy, self-directed learning, and long-term reliability of decision making.
Real-world agentic systems operate in decentralized settings on a large set of
tasks or data distributions with constraints such as limited bandwidth,
asynchronous execution, and the absence of a centralized model or even common
objectives. We posit that exploiting previously learned skills, task
similarities, and communication capabilities in a collective of agentic AI are
challenging but essential elements to enabling scalability, open-endedness, and
beneficial collaborative learning dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Modular
Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning (MOSAIC), an agentic algorithm
that allows multiple agents to independently solve different tasks while also
identifying, sharing, and reusing useful machine-learned knowledge, without
coordination, synchronization, or centralized control. MOSAIC combines three
mechanisms: (1) modular policy composition via neural network masks, (2) cosine
similarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and
(3) asynchronous communication and policy integration. Results on a set of RL
benchmarks show that MOSAIC has a greater sample efficiency than isolated
learners, i.e., it learns significantly faster, and in some cases, finds
solutions to tasks that cannot be solved by isolated learners. The
collaborative learning and sharing dynamics are also observed to result in the
emergence of ideal curricula of tasks, from easy to hard. These findings
support the case for collaborative learning in agentic systems to achieve
better and continuously evolving performance both at the individual and
collective levels.

Abstract: In recent years there has been a considerable amount of research on local
post hoc explanations for neural networks. However, work on building
interpretable neural architectures has been relatively sparse. In this paper,
we present a novel neural architecture, CoFrNet, inspired by the form of
continued fractions which are known to have many attractive properties in
number theory, such as fast convergence of approximations to real numbers. We
show that CoFrNets can be efficiently trained as well as interpreted leveraging
their particular functional form. Moreover, we prove that such architectures
are universal approximators based on a proof strategy that is different than
the typical strategy used to prove universal approximation results for neural
networks based on infinite width (or depth), which is likely to be of
independent interest. We experiment on nonlinear synthetic functions and are
able to accurately model as well as estimate feature attributions and even
higher order terms in some cases, which is a testament to the representational
power as well as interpretability of such architectures. To further showcase
the power of CoFrNets, we experiment on seven real datasets spanning tabular,
text and image modalities, and show that they are either comparable or
significantly better than other interpretable models and multilayer
perceptrons, sometimes approaching the accuracies of state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: The Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) framework is a leading
approach for achieving efficient learning and robust performance across many RL
tasks. However, MaxEnt methods have also been shown to struggle with
performance-critical control problems in practice, where non-MaxEnt algorithms
can successfully learn. In this work, we analyze how the trade-off between
robustness and optimality affects the performance of MaxEnt algorithms in
complex control tasks: while entropy maximization enhances exploration and
robustness, it can also mislead policy optimization, leading to failure in
tasks that require precise, low-entropy policies. Through experiments on a
variety of control problems, we concretely demonstrate this misleading effect.
Our analysis leads to better understanding of how to balance reward design and
entropy maximization in challenging control problems.

Conclusion: BiTrajDiff通过双向轨迹生成显著提升了离线强化学习的性能和数据多样性。

Abstract: Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that
effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on
pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit
distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this
limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which
leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising
results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future
trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history
transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders
the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to
critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we
introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework
for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any
intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task
into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating
forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating
backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can
efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially
valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating
dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite
demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other
advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.

Abstract: Backward compatible representation learning enables updated models to
integrate seamlessly with existing ones, avoiding to reprocess stored data.
Despite recent advances, existing compatibility approaches in Euclidean space
neglect the uncertainty in the old embedding model and force the new model to
reconstruct outdated representations regardless of their quality, thereby
hindering the learning process of the new model. In this paper, we propose to
switch perspectives to hyperbolic geometry, where we treat time as a natural
axis for capturing a model's confidence and evolution. By lifting embeddings
into hyperbolic space and constraining updated embeddings to lie within the
entailment cone of the old ones, we maintain generational consistency across
models while accounting for uncertainties in the representations. To further
enhance compatibility, we introduce a robust contrastive alignment loss that
dynamically adjusts alignment weights based on the uncertainty of the old
embeddings. Experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in
achieving compatibility, paving the way for more resilient and adaptable
machine learning systems.

Abstract: Reliability of deep learning models is critical for deployment in high-stakes
applications, where out-of-distribution or adversarial inputs may lead to
detrimental outcomes. Evidential Deep Learning, an efficient paradigm for
uncertainty quantification, models predictions as Dirichlet distributions of a
single forward pass. However, EDL is particularly vulnerable to adversarially
perturbed inputs, making overconfident errors. Conflict-aware Evidential Deep
Learning (C-EDL) is a lightweight post-hoc uncertainty quantification approach
that mitigates these issues, enhancing adversarial and OOD robustness without
retraining. C-EDL generates diverse, task-preserving transformations per input
and quantifies representational disagreement to calibrate uncertainty estimates
when needed. C-EDL's conflict-aware prediction adjustment improves detection of
OOD and adversarial inputs, maintaining high in-distribution accuracy and low
computational overhead. Our experimental evaluation shows that C-EDL
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art EDL variants and competitive
baselines, achieving substantial reductions in coverage for OOD data (up to
55%) and adversarial data (up to 90%), across a range of datasets, attack

Abstract: Diagnosing deep neural networks (DNNs) through the eigenspectrum of weight
matrices has been an active area of research in recent years. At a high level,
eigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the
empirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into
how well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better
layer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge
associated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of
weight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that
matrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias
in estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose
FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the
weight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead
of measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD
of these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of
these submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the
aspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization
techniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of
weights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,
scientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model
(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly
improves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains. In one of
the LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model
by 17.3% when compared with the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Zeroth-order methods are extensively used in machine learning applications
where gradients are infeasible or expensive to compute, such as black-box
attacks, reinforcement learning, and language model fine-tuning. Existing
optimization theory focuses on convergence to an arbitrary stationary point,
but less is known on the implicit regularization that provides a fine-grained
characterization on which particular solutions are finally reached. We show
that zeroth-order optimization with the standard two-point estimator favors
solutions with small trace of Hessian, which is widely used in previous work to
distinguish between sharp and flat minima. We further provide convergence rates
of zeroth-order optimization to approximate flat minima for convex and
sufficiently smooth functions, where flat minima are defined as the minimizers
that achieve the smallest trace of Hessian among all optimal solutions.
Experiments on binary classification tasks with convex losses and language
model fine-tuning support our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely used to equip black-box machine learning
models with uncertainty quantification enjoying formal coverage guarantees.
However, these guarantees typically break down in the presence of distribution
shifts, where the data distribution at test time differs from the training (or
calibration-time) distribution. In this work, we address subpopulation shifts,
where the test environment exhibits an unknown and differing mixture of
subpopulations compared to the calibration data. We propose new methods that
provably adapt conformal prediction to such shifts, ensuring valid coverage
without requiring explicit knowledge of subpopulation structure. Our algorithms
scale to high-dimensional settings and perform effectively in realistic machine
learning tasks. Extensive experiments on vision (with vision transformers) and
language (with large language models) benchmarks demonstrate that our methods
reliably maintain coverage and controls risk in scenarios where standard

Abstract: We study a relaxation of the problem of coupling probability distributions --
a list of samples is generated from one distribution and an accept is declared
if any one of these samples is identical to the sample generated from the other
distribution. We propose a novel method for generating samples, which extends
the Gumbel-max sampling suggested in Daliri et al. (arXiv:2408.07978) for
coupling probability distributions. We also establish a corresponding lower
bound on the acceptance probability, which we call the list matching lemma. We
next discuss two applications of our setup. First, we develop a new mechanism
for multi-draft speculative sampling that is simple to implement and achieves
performance competitive with baselines such as SpecTr and SpecInfer across a
range of language tasks. Our method also guarantees a certain degree of drafter
invariance with respect to the output tokens which is not supported by existing
schemes. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the token level
acceptance probability. As our second application, we consider distributed
lossy compression with side information in a setting where a source sample is
compressed and available to multiple decoders, each with independent side
information. We propose a compression technique that is based on our

Motivation: 传统QD算法依赖手工定义的行为描述符，限制了探索的多样性。AutoQD旨在自动生成行为描述符，以支持更开放的探索。

Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have shown remarkable success in
discovering diverse, high-performing solutions, but rely heavily on
hand-crafted behavioral descriptors that constrain exploration to predefined
notions of diversity. Leveraging the equivalence between policies and occupancy
measures, we present a theoretically grounded approach to automatically
generate behavioral descriptors by embedding the occupancy measures of policies
in Markov Decision Processes. Our method, AutoQD, leverages random Fourier
features to approximate the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between policy
occupancy measures, creating embeddings whose distances reflect meaningful
behavioral differences. A low-dimensional projection of these embeddings that
captures the most behaviorally significant dimensions is then used as
behavioral descriptors for off-the-shelf QD methods. We prove that our
embeddings converge to true MMD distances between occupancy measures as the
number of sampled trajectories and embedding dimensions increase. Through
experiments in multiple continuous control tasks we demonstrate AutoQD's
ability in discovering diverse policies without predefined behavioral
descriptors, presenting a well-motivated alternative to prior methods in
unsupervised Reinforcement Learning and QD optimization. Our approach opens new
possibilities for open-ended learning and automated behavior discovery in
sequential decision making settings without requiring domain-specific
knowledge.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过正则化（显式或隐式）诱导神经网络中的“grokking”现象，即延迟泛化。研究发现，当存在具有特定属性（如稀疏或低秩权重）的模型时，梯度下降结合小但非零的正则化会导致grokking。此外，过参数化（增加深度）可以在不使用显式正则化的情况下实现或取消grokking。

Motivation: 研究grokking现象的成因及其与正则化的关系，以更好地理解神经网络训练中的泛化行为。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，探讨梯度下降结合不同正则化方法（如ℓ₁或核范数正则化）对grokking的影响，并研究过参数化和数据选择的作用。

Result: 发现小但非零的正则化可以诱导grokking；过参数化可以在不使用显式正则化的情况下实现或取消grokking；ℓ₂范数在模型被正则化为其他属性时不可靠；数据选择可以放大grokking。

Conclusion: 正则化和过参数化是grokking现象的关键因素，研究结果为理解神经网络泛化行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Grokking refers to a delayed generalization following overfitting when
optimizing artificial neural networks with gradient-based methods. In this
work, we demonstrate that grokking can be induced by regularization, either
explicit or implicit. More precisely, we show that when there exists a model
with a property $P$ (e.g., sparse or low-rank weights) that generalizes on the
problem of interest, gradient descent with a small but non-zero regularization
of $P$ (e.g., $\ell_1$ or nuclear norm regularization) results in grokking.
This extends previous work showing that small non-zero weight decay induces
grokking. Moreover, our analysis shows that over-parameterization by adding
depth makes it possible to grok or ungrok without explicitly using
regularization, which is impossible in shallow cases. We further show that the
$\ell_2$ norm is not a reliable proxy for generalization when the model is
regularized toward a different property $P$, as the $\ell_2$ norm grows in many
cases where no weight decay is used, but the model generalizes anyway. We also
show that grokking can be amplified solely through data selection, with any
other hyperparameter fixed.

Abstract: A phenomenon known as ''Neural Collapse (NC)'' in deep classification tasks,
in which the penultimate-layer features and the final classifiers exhibit an
extremely simple geometric structure, has recently attracted considerable
attention, with the expectation that it can deepen our understanding of how
deep neural networks behave. The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) has been
proposed to explain NC theoretically, and there emerges a growing body of work
that extends NC to tasks other than classification and leverages it for
practical applications. In this study, we investigate whether a similar
phenomenon arises in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, via combining the
cumulative link model for OR and UFM. We show that a phenomenon we call Ordinal
Neural Collapse (ONC) indeed emerges and is characterized by the following
three properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to
their within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class
means align with the classifier, meaning that they collapse onto a
one-dimensional subspace; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables (corresponding to
logits or preactivations in classification tasks) are aligned according to the
class order, and in particular, in the zero-regularization limit, a highly
local and simple geometric relationship emerges between the latent variables
and the threshold values. We prove these properties analytically within the UFM
framework with fixed threshold values and corroborate them empirically across a
variety of datasets. We also discuss how these insights can be leveraged in OR,
highlighting the use of fixed thresholds.

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

Abstract: We present a feasibility-seeking approach to neural network training. This
mathematical optimization framework is distinct from conventional
gradient-based loss minimization and uses projection operators and iterative
projection algorithms. We reformulate training as a large-scale feasibility
problem: finding network parameters and states that satisfy local constraints
derived from its elementary operations. Training then involves projecting onto
these constraints, a local operation that can be parallelized across the
network. We introduce PJAX, a JAX-based software framework that enables this
paradigm. PJAX composes projection operators for elementary operations,
automatically deriving the solution operators for the feasibility problems
(akin to autodiff for derivatives). It inherently supports GPU/TPU
acceleration, provides a familiar NumPy-like API, and is extensible. We train
diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs) on standard benchmarks using PJAX,
demonstrating its functionality and generality. Our results show that this
approach is as a compelling alternative to gradient-based training, with clear
advantages in parallelism and the ability to handle non-differentiable
operations.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了不确定性估计的可靠性，适用于多种视觉数据集。

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

Abstract: Machine unlearning addresses the problem of updating a machine learning
model/system trained on a dataset $S$ so that the influence of a set of
deletion requests $U \subseteq S$ on the unlearned model is minimized. The gold
standard definition of unlearning demands that the updated model, after
deletion, be nearly identical to the model obtained by retraining. This
definition is designed for a worst-case attacker (one who can recover not only
the unlearned model but also the remaining data samples, i.e., $S \setminus
U$). Such a stringent definition has made developing efficient unlearning
algorithms challenging. However, such strong attackers are also unrealistic. In
this work, we propose a new definition, system-aware unlearning, which aims to
provide unlearning guarantees against an attacker that can at best only gain
access to the data stored in the system for learning/unlearning requests and
not all of $S\setminus U$. With this new definition, we use the simple
intuition that if a system can store less to make its learning/unlearning
updates, it can be more secure and update more efficiently against a
system-aware attacker. Towards that end, we present an exact system-aware
unlearning algorithm for linear classification using a selective sampling-based
approach, and we generalize the method for classification with general function
classes. We theoretically analyze the tradeoffs between deletion capacity,
accuracy, memory, and computation time.

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy and security highlight the importance of
machine unlearning--removing specific data influences from trained models
without full retraining. Techniques like Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)
are widely used to externally assess successful unlearning. However, existing
methods face two key limitations: (1) maximizing MIA effectiveness (e.g., via
online attacks) requires prohibitive computational resources, often exceeding
retraining costs; (2) MIAs, designed for binary inclusion tests, struggle to
capture granular changes in approximate unlearning. To address these
challenges, we propose the Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM), a
framework natively designed for unlearning inference. IAM quantifies
sample-level unlearning completeness by interpolating the model's
generalization-fitting behavior gap on queried samples. IAM achieves strong
performance in binary inclusion tests for exact unlearning and high correlation
for approximate unlearning--scalable to LLMs using just one pre-trained shadow
model. We theoretically analyze how IAM's scoring mechanism maintains
performance efficiently. We then apply IAM to recent approximate unlearning
algorithms, revealing general risks of both over-unlearning and
under-unlearning, underscoring the need for stronger safeguards in approximate
unlearning systems. The code is available at

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

Abstract: While conservation laws in gradient flow training dynamics are well
understood for (mostly shallow) ReLU and linear networks, their study remains
largely unexplored for more practical architectures. This paper bridges this
gap by deriving and analyzing conservation laws for modern architectures, with
a focus on convolutional ResNets and Transformer networks. For this, we first
show that basic building blocks such as ReLU (or linear) shallow networks, with
or without convolution, have easily expressed conservation laws, and no more
than the known ones. In the case of a single attention layer, we also
completely describe all conservation laws, and we show that residual blocks
have the same conservation laws as the same block without a skip connection. We
then introduce the notion of conservation laws that depend only on a subset of
parameters (corresponding e.g. to a pair of consecutive layers, to a residual
block, or to an attention layer). We demonstrate that the characterization of
such laws can be reduced to the analysis of the corresponding building block in
isolation. Finally, we examine how these newly discovered conservation
principles, initially established in the continuous gradient flow regime,
persist under discrete optimization dynamics, particularly in the context of
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

Abstract: The growing adoption of large pre-trained models in edge computing has made
deploying model inference on mobile clients both practical and popular. These
devices are inherently vulnerable to direct adversarial attacks, which pose a
substantial threat to the robustness and security of deployed models. Federated
adversarial training (FAT) has emerged as an effective solution to enhance
model robustness while preserving client privacy. However, FAT frequently
produces a generalized global model, which struggles to address the diverse and
heterogeneous data distributions across clients, resulting in insufficiently
personalized performance, while also encountering substantial communication
challenges during the training process. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sylva}, a personalized collaborative adversarial training framework
designed to deliver customized defense models for each client through a
two-phase process. In Phase 1, \textit{Sylva} employs LoRA for local
adversarial fine-tuning, enabling clients to personalize model robustness while
drastically reducing communication costs by uploading only LoRA parameters
during federated aggregation. In Phase 2, a game-based layer selection strategy
is introduced to enhance accuracy on benign data, further refining the
personalized model. This approach ensures that each client receives a tailored
defense model that balances robustness and accuracy effectively. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textit{Sylva} can achieve
up to 50$\times$ improvements in communication efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, while achieving up to 29.5\% and 50.4\%
enhancements in adversarial robustness and benign accuracy, respectively.

nearest neighbors among previously executed plans, and recommends database
hintsets based on neighborhood voting. A lightweight consistency check
validates the selected hint, while a fallback mechanism searches the full hint
space when needed. Evaluated on the JOB-CEB benchmark using OpenGauss, LLM-PM
achieves an average speed-up of 21% query latency reduction. This work
highlights the potential of LLM-powered embeddings to deliver practical
improvements in query performance and opens new directions for training-free,

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods has
revolutionized molecular medicine by driving breakthroughs in genomics,
transcriptomics, drug discovery, and biological systems modeling. The
increasing quantity, multimodality, and heterogeneity of biological datasets
demand automated methods that can produce generalizable predictive models.
Recent developments in large language model-based agents have shown promise for
automating end-to-end ML experimentation on structured benchmarks. However,
when applied to heterogeneous computational biology datasets, these methods
struggle with generalization and success rates. Here, we introduce
Agentomics-ML, a fully autonomous agent-based system designed to produce a
classification model and the necessary files for reproducible training and
inference. Our method follows predefined steps of an ML experimentation
process, repeatedly interacting with the file system through Bash to complete
individual steps. Once an ML model is produced, training and validation metrics
provide scalar feedback to a reflection step to identify issues such as
overfitting. This step then creates verbal feedback for future iterations,
suggesting adjustments to steps such as data representation, model
architecture, and hyperparameter choices. We have evaluated Agentomics-ML on
several established genomic and transcriptomic benchmark datasets and show that
it outperforms existing state-of-the-art agent-based methods in both
generalization and success rates. While state-of-the-art models built by domain
experts still lead in absolute performance on the majority of the computational
biology datasets used in this work, Agentomics-ML narrows the gap for fully
autonomous systems and achieves state-of-the-art performance on one of the used

Abstract: Early prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) conversion is hampered by
a trade-off between immediacy--making fast predictions from a single baseline
sMRI--and accuracy--leveraging longitudinal scans to capture disease
progression. We propose MCI-Diff, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes
clinically plausible future sMRI representations directly from baseline data,
achieving both real-time risk assessment and high predictive performance.
First, a multi-task sequence reconstruction strategy trains a shared denoising
network on interpolation and extrapolation tasks to handle irregular follow-up
sampling and learn robust latent trajectories. Second, an LLM-driven
"linguistic compass" is introduced for clinical plausibility sampling:
generated feature candidates are quantized, tokenized, and scored by a
fine-tuned language model conditioned on expected structural biomarkers,
guiding autoregressive generation toward realistic disease patterns.
Experiments on ADNI and AIBL cohorts show that MCI-Diff outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, improving early conversion accuracy by 5-12%.

employs a neural network with multiple heads and utilizes the Winner-Takes-All

relate to its implicit quantization objective. We provide insights into our
approach using synthetic data and evaluate it on real-world time series,
demonstrating its promising performance at a light computational cost.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过优化传输（OT）方法改进流模型训练，提出使用大规模Sinkhorn耦合和低熵正则化来提高效率。


<details>

Motivation: 流模型在无配对数据（如生成任务）时训练困难，传统方法效率低。通过OT方法优化配对，可以提高训练和推理效率。

Method: 采用大规模Sinkhorn耦合（批量大小增加3-4个数量级）和低熵正则化，通过多GPU节点并行计算实现。

Result: 在合成和图像生成任务中，流模型在大规模Sinkhorn耦合和低熵正则化下表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 大规模Sinkhorn耦合和低熵正则化是改进流模型训练的有效方法。

Abstract: Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto
another (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent
velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target
points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training
flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing
exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much
harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points
independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to
train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would
greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal
transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a
highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In
practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and
$n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs.
These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered
OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the
Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a.
Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits
of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully
on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn
algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to
report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across
multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic
and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large
Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.

Conclusion: 论文为SGNN的表达能力提供了新的评估和改进框架，填补了现有研究的不足。

Abstract: Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among
non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian
eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The
expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated
via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet,
these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight
into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of
classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an
expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete
even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt
rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a
method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We
empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification
experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on
graphs from ZINC.

Conclusion: 知识超图和超关系知识图谱能更好地建模复杂知识结构，但仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Real-world knowledge can take various forms, including structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data. Among these, knowledge graphs are a
form of structured human knowledge that integrate heterogeneous data sources
into structured representations but typically reduce complex n-ary relations to
simple triples, thereby losing higher-order relational details. In contrast,
hypergraphs naturally represent n-ary relations with hyperedges, which directly
connect multiple entities together. Yet hypergraph representation learning
often overlooks entity roles in hyperedges, limiting the fine-grained semantic
modelling. To address these issues, knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs combine the advantages of knowledge graphs and hypergraphs to
better capture the complex structures and role-specific semantics of real-world
knowledge. This survey provides a comprehensive review of methods handling
n-ary relational data, covering both knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs literatures. We propose a two-dimensional taxonomy: the first
dimension categorises models based on their methodology, i.e.,
translation-based models, tensor factorisation-based models, deep neural
network-based models, logic rules-based models, and hyperedge expansion-based
models. The second dimension classifies models according to their awareness of
entity roles and positions in n-ary relations, dividing them into aware-less,
position-aware, and role-aware approaches. Finally, we discuss existing
datasets, negative sampling strategies, and outline open challenges to inspire
future research.

Abstract: Optimizing complex systems, from discovering therapeutic drugs to designing
high-performance materials, remains a fundamental challenge across science and
engineering, as the underlying rules are often unknown and costly to evaluate.
Offline optimization aims to optimize designs for target scores using
pre-collected datasets without system interaction. However, conventional
approaches may fail beyond training data, predicting inaccurate scores and
generating inferior designs. This paper introduces ManGO, a diffusion-based
framework that learns the design-score manifold, capturing the design-score
interdependencies holistically. Unlike existing methods that treat design and
score spaces in isolation, ManGO unifies forward prediction and backward
generation, attaining generalization beyond training data. Key to this is its
derivative-free guidance for conditional generation, coupled with adaptive
inference-time scaling that dynamically optimizes denoising paths. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10
multi-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including
synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world
engineering optimization.

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR),

Abstract: This position paper argues that post-deployment monitoring in clinical AI is
underdeveloped and proposes statistically valid and label-efficient testing
frameworks as a principled foundation for ensuring reliability and safety in
real-world deployment. A recent review found that only 9% of FDA-registered
AI-based healthcare tools include a post-deployment surveillance plan. Existing
monitoring approaches are often manual, sporadic, and reactive, making them
ill-suited for the dynamic environments in which clinical models operate. We
contend that post-deployment monitoring should be grounded in label-efficient
and statistically valid testing frameworks, offering a principled alternative
to current practices. We use the term "statistically valid" to refer to methods
that provide explicit guarantees on error rates (e.g., Type I/II error), enable
formal inference under pre-defined assumptions, and support
reproducibility--features that align with regulatory requirements.
Specifically, we propose that the detection of changes in the data and model
performance degradation should be framed as distinct statistical hypothesis
testing problems. Grounding monitoring in statistical rigor ensures a
reproducible and scientifically sound basis for maintaining the reliability of
clinical AI systems. Importantly, it also opens new research directions for the
technical community--spanning theory, methods, and tools for statistically
principled detection, attribution, and mitigation of post-deployment model
failures in real-world settings.

Conclusion: AACL框架为解决动态能力下的持续学习问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is a powerful tool that enables agents to learn a
sequence of tasks, accumulating knowledge learned in the past and using it for
problem-solving or future task learning. However, existing CL methods often
assume that the agent's capabilities remain static within dynamic environments,
which doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where capabilities dynamically
change. This paper introduces a new and realistic problem: Continual Learning
with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), posing a significant challenge for CL
agents: How can policy generalization across different action spaces be
achieved? Inspired by the cortical functions, we propose an Action-Adaptive
Continual Learning framework (AACL) to address this challenge. Our framework
decouples the agent's policy from the specific action space by building an
action representation space. For a new action space, the encoder-decoder of
action representations is adaptively fine-tuned to maintain a balance between
stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we release a benchmark based on three
environments to validate the effectiveness of methods for CL-DC. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms popular methods by
generalizing the policy across action spaces.

Conclusion: 该框架为6G系统中GAI驱动的鲁棒语义传输提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by
generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, specifically leveraging
the capabilities of diffusion models (DMs). A rigorous theoretical foundation
is established based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which
elucidates the denoising properties of DMs in mitigating additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) in latent semantic representations. Crucially, a
closed-form analytical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the denoising timestep is derived, enabling the optimal selection of diffusion
parameters for any given channel condition. To address the distribution
mismatch between the received signal and the DM's training data, a
mathematically principled scaling mechanism is introduced, ensuring robust
performance across a wide range of SNRs without requiring model fine-tuning.
Built upon this theoretical insight, we develop a latent diffusion model
(LDM)-based semantic transceiver, wherein a variational autoencoder (VAE) is
employed for efficient semantic compression, and a pretrained DM serves as a
universal denoiser. Notably, the proposed architecture is fully training-free
at inference time, offering high modularity and compatibility with large-scale
pretrained LDMs. This design inherently supports zero-shot generalization and
mitigates the challenges posed by out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms conventional neural-network-based semantic communication baselines,
particularly under low SNR conditions and distributional shifts, thereby
establishing a promising direction for GAI-driven robust semantic transmission
in future 6G systems.

Abstract: While many algorithmic extensions to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) have been
proposed, there remains limited understanding of how different improvements
interact. In particular, multi-step and ensemble style extensions have shown
promise in reducing overestimation bias, thereby improving sample efficiency
and algorithmic stability. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called
Ensemble Elastic Step DQN (EEDQN), which unifies ensembles with elastic step
updates to stabilise algorithmic performance. EEDQN is designed to address two
major challenges in deep reinforcement learning: overestimation bias and sample
efficiency. We evaluated EEDQN against standard and ensemble DQN variants
across the MinAtar benchmark, a set of environments that emphasise behavioral
learning while reducing representational complexity. Our results show that
EEDQN achieves consistently robust performance across all tested environments,
outperforming baseline DQN methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art
ensemble DQNs in final returns on most of the MinAtar environments. These
findings highlight the potential of systematically combining algorithmic
improvements and provide evidence that ensemble and multi-step methods, when
carefully integrated, can yield substantial gains.

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

Abstract: Real-world data streams exhibit inherent non-stationarity characterized by
concept drift, posing significant challenges for adaptive learning systems.
While existing methods address isolated distribution shifts, they overlook the
critical co-evolution of label spaces and distributions under limited
supervision and persistent uncertainty. To address this, we formalize
Generalized Incremental Learning under Concept Drift (GILCD), characterizing
the joint evolution of distributions and label spaces in open-environment
streaming contexts, and propose a novel framework called Calibrated Source-Free
Adaptation (CSFA). First, CSFA introduces a training-free prototype calibration
mechanism that dynamically fuses emerging prototypes with base representations,
enabling stable new-class identification without optimization overhead. Second,
we design a novel source-free adaptation algorithm, i.e., Reliable Surrogate
Gap Sharpness-aware (RSGS) minimization. It integrates sharpness-aware
perturbation loss optimization with surrogate gap minimization, while employing
entropy-based uncertainty filtering to discard unreliable samples. This
mechanism ensures robust distribution alignment and mitigates generalization
degradation caused by uncertainties. Therefore, CSFA establishes a unified
framework for stable adaptation to evolving semantics and distributions in
open-world streaming scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the superior

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PDO方法在解决子问题时需要高精度解，导致计算开销大，SPDO旨在减少这种开销并提升效率。

Method: SPDO方法通过放松子问题精度要求并利用平均功能相似性，优化通信和计算复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，SPDO在通信和计算复杂度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPDO在去中心化优化中实现了显著的性能提升，为高效优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reducing communication complexity is critical for efficient decentralized
optimization. The proximal decentralized optimization (PDO) framework is
particularly appealing, as methods within this framework can exploit functional
similarity among nodes to reduce communication rounds. Specifically, when local
functions at different nodes are similar, these methods achieve faster
convergence with fewer communication steps. However, existing PDO methods often
require highly accurate solutions to subproblems associated with the proximal
operator, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we
propose the Stabilized Proximal Decentralized Optimization (SPDO) method, which
achieves state-of-the-art communication and computational complexities within
the PDO framework. Additionally, we refine the analysis of existing PDO methods
by relaxing subproblem accuracy requirements and leveraging average functional
similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that SPDO significantly
outperforms existing methods.

Motivation: GNNs的局部归纳偏差限制了其对关键结构信息的利用，PE和PH是两种潜在解决方案，但缺乏理论比较。

Method: 通过理论分析比较PE和PH的表达能力，提出了一种结合两者的新方法PiPE。

Result: PiPE在分子属性预测、图分类和分布外泛化等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: PiPE为图表示学习提供了更强大的工具，超越了PE和PH的局限性。

Abstract: The local inductive bias of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs)
hampers their ability to exploit key structural information (e.g., connectivity
and cycles). Positional encoding (PE) and Persistent Homology (PH) have emerged
as two promising approaches to mitigate this issue. PE schemes endow GNNs with
location-aware features, while PH methods enhance GNNs with multiresolution
topological features. However, a rigorous theoretical characterization of the
relative merits and shortcomings of PE and PH has remained elusive. We bridge
this gap by establishing that neither paradigm is more expressive than the
other, providing novel constructions where one approach fails but the other
succeeds. Our insights inform the design of a novel learnable method, PiPE
(Persistence-informed Positional Encoding), which is provably more expressive
than both PH and PE. PiPE demonstrates strong performance across a variety of
tasks (e.g., molecule property prediction, graph classification, and
out-of-distribution generalization), thereby advancing the frontiers of graph
representation learning. Code is available at

Abstract: While denoising diffusion and flow matching have driven major advances in

VFM to data with mixed continuous and discrete features, we introduce
Exponential Family Variational Flow Matching (EF-VFM), which represents
heterogeneous data types using a general exponential family distribution. We
hereby obtain an efficient, data-driven objective based on moment matching,
enabling principled learning of probability paths over mixed continuous and
discrete variables. We also establish a connection between variational flow
matching and generalized flow matching objectives based on Bregman divergences.
Evaluation on tabular data benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance

signals from the same distribution, as demonstrated by the experimental

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance
degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering
their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed
various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge,
with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an
invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue
that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging
and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong
correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first
pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD
generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, \mine{} retains the invariant
subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization.
Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges:
1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2)
$\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious
edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that
PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods significantly. Codes are available at:

Motivation: 扩散模型的大规模应用受限于高硬件资源需求，现有量化方法多为均匀标量量化（USQ），而向量量化（VQ）在大型语言模型（LLM）中表现优异，因此探索其在扩散模型中的应用。

Method: 采用基于码本的加法向量量化方法，对扩散模型进行压缩，并通过高效推理内核实现FLOPs节省。

Result: 在LDM-4基准测试中，W4A8量化下sFID比全精度模型低1.92分，W2A8量化下FID、sFID和ISC均达到最佳结果。

Conclusion: 向量量化方法为扩散模型压缩提供了新的高效解决方案，显著降低了资源需求并保持了性能。

Abstract: Significant investments have been made towards the commodification of
diffusion models for generation of diverse media. Their mass-market adoption is
however still hobbled by the intense hardware resource requirements of
diffusion model inference. Model quantization strategies tailored specifically
towards diffusion models have been useful in easing this burden, yet have
generally explored the Uniform Scalar Quantization (USQ) family of quantization
methods. In contrast, Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, which operate on groups
of multiple related weights as the basic unit of compression, have seen
substantial success in Large Language Model (LLM) quantization. In this work,
we apply codebook-based additive vector quantization to the problem of
diffusion model compression. Our resulting approach achieves a new Pareto
frontier for the extremely low-bit weight quantization on the standard
class-conditional benchmark of LDM-4 on ImageNet at 20 inference time steps.
Notably, we report sFID 1.92 points lower than the full-precision model at W4A8
and the best-reported results for FID, sFID and ISC at W2A8. We are also able
to demonstrate FLOPs savings on arbitrary hardware via an efficient inference

Abstract: Long-range graph tasks -- those dependent on interactions between distant
nodes -- are an open problem in graph neural network research. Real-world
benchmark tasks, especially the Long Range Graph Benchmark, have become popular
for validating the long-range capability of proposed architectures. However,
this is an empirical approach that lacks both robustness and theoretical
underpinning; a more principled characterization of the long-range problem is
required. To bridge this gap, we formalize long-range interactions in graph
tasks, introduce a range measure for operators on graphs, and validate it with
synthetic experiments. We then leverage our measure to examine commonly used
tasks and architectures, and discuss to what extent they are, in fact,
long-range. We believe our work advances efforts to define and address the
long-range problem on graphs, and that our range measure will aid evaluation of
new datasets and architectures.

inductive bias of periods inherent in time series, LightGTS uses a lightweight

achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 9 real-world benchmarks in
both zero-shot and full-shot settings with much better efficiency compared with
existing time series foundation models.

Abstract: Estimation of causal effects is critical to a range of scientific
disciplines. Existing methods for this task either require interventional data,
knowledge about the ground truth causal graph, or rely on assumptions such as
unconfoundedness, restricting their applicability in real-world settings. In
the domain of tabular machine learning, Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have
achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance, having been pre-trained on
synthetic data to solve tabular prediction problems via in-context learning. To
assess whether this can be transferred to the harder problem of causal effect
estimation, we pre-train PFNs on synthetic data drawn from a wide variety of
causal structures, including interventions, to predict interventional outcomes
given observational data. Through extensive experiments on synthetic case
studies, we show that our approach allows for the accurate estimation of causal
effects without knowledge of the underlying causal graph. We also perform
ablation studies that elucidate Do-PFN's scalability and robustness across
datasets with a variety of causal characteristics.

Abstract: Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for
simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and
generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with
capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations, and
suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on
local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these
limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network
(ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i)
Rolling Diffusion, a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of
diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising
steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built
on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across
different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via
Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local
dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending
or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid
mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities.
ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially
outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference
time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for learning from
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs do not consider the conservation
law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources, such as
electrical current in power grids or traffic in transportation networks, which
can lead to reduced model performance. To address this, we propose flow
attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy
Kirchhoff\'s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification
influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can
be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through
extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power
grids), we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of
attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.

machine learning models. In order to ease prototyping and benchmarking of HPO
methods, we propose carps, a benchmark framework for Comprehensive Automated
Research Performance Studies allowing to evaluate N optimizers on M benchmark
tasks. In this first release of carps, we focus on the four most important
types of HPO task types: blackbox, multi-fidelity, multi-objective and
multi-fidelity-multi-objective. With 3 336 tasks from 5 community benchmark
collections and 28 variants of 9 optimizer families, we offer the biggest go-to
library to date to evaluate and compare HPO methods. The carps framework relies
on a purpose-built, lightweight interface, gluing together optimizers and
benchmark tasks. It also features an analysis pipeline, facilitating the
evaluation of optimizers on benchmarks. However, navigating a huge number of
tasks while developing and comparing methods can be computationally infeasible.
To address this, we obtain a subset of representative tasks by minimizing the
star discrepancy of the subset, in the space spanned by the full set. As a
result, we propose an initial subset of 10 to 30 diverse tasks for each task
type, and include functionality to re-compute subsets as more benchmarks become
available, enabling efficient evaluations. We also establish a first set of
baseline results on these tasks as a measure for future comparisons. With carps

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of antithetic initial noise in diffusion
models. Across unconditional models trained on diverse datasets,
text-conditioned latent-diffusion models, and diffusion-posterior samplers, we
find that pairing each initial noise with its negation consistently yields
strongly negatively correlated samples. To explain this phenomenon, we combine
experiments and theoretical analysis, leading to a symmetry conjecture that the
learned score function is approximately affine antisymmetric (odd symmetry up
to a constant shift), and provide evidence supporting it. Leveraging this
negative correlation, we enable two applications: (1) enhancing image diversity
in models like Stable Diffusion without quality loss, and (2) sharpening
uncertainty quantification (e.g., up to 90% narrower confidence intervals) when
estimating downstream statistics. Building on these gains, we extend the
two-point pairing to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator, which further
improves estimation accuracy. Our framework is training-free, model-agnostic,
and adds no runtime overhead.

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{MGCL}$, a model-driven graph contrastive learning (GCL)
framework that leverages graphons (probabilistic generative models for graphs)
to guide contrastive learning by accounting for the data's underlying
generative process. GCL has emerged as a powerful self-supervised framework for
learning expressive node or graph representations without relying on annotated
labels, which are often scarce in real-world data. By contrasting augmented
views of graph data, GCL has demonstrated strong performance across various
downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification. However, existing
methods typically rely on manually designed or heuristic augmentation
strategies that are not tailored to the underlying data distribution and
operate at the individual graph level, ignoring similarities among graphs
generated from the same model. Conversely, in our proposed approach, MGCL first
estimates the graphon associated with the observed data and then defines a
graphon-informed augmentation process, enabling data-adaptive and principled
augmentations. Additionally, for graph-level tasks, MGCL clusters the dataset
and estimates a graphon per group, enabling contrastive pairs to reflect shared
semantics and structure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of incorporating generative models into GCL.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one

Motivation: 扩展平衡传播（EP）算法以处理时间变化输入，解决静态输入模型的局限性。

Method: 提出了广义拉格朗日平衡传播（GLEP），通过变分描述扩展到时间变化输入，并分析不同边界条件下的学习算法。

Result: GLEP在不同边界条件下生成多种学习算法，其中HEL是唯一实用的特例，具备高效、局部学习和硬件友好特性。

Conclusion: GLEP为时间变化输入提供了理论框架，HEL是其实际可行的实现，适用于硬件优化。

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a learning algorithm for training
Energy-based Models (EBMs) on static inputs which leverages the variational
description of their fixed points. Extending EP to time-varying inputs is a
challenging problem, as the variational description must apply to the entire
system trajectory rather than just fixed points, and careful consideration of
boundary conditions becomes essential. In this work, we present Generalized
Lagrangian Equilibrium Propagation (GLEP), which extends the variational
formulation of EP to time-varying inputs. We demonstrate that GLEP yields
different learning algorithms depending on the boundary conditions of the
system, many of which are impractical for implementation. We then show that
Hamiltonian Echo Learning (HEL) -- which includes the recently proposed
Recurrent HEL (RHEL) and the earlier known Hamiltonian Echo Backpropagation
(HEB) algorithms -- can be derived as a special case of GLEP. Notably, HEL is
the only instance of GLEP we found that inherits the properties that make EP a
desirable alternative to backpropagation for hardware implementations: it
operates in a "forward-only" manner (i.e. using the same system for both
inference and learning), it scales efficiently (requiring only two or more
passes through the system regardless of model size), and enables local
learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces the MPS (Model Prediction Set), a novel framework for
online model selection for nonstationary time series. Classical model selection
methods, such as information criteria and cross-validation, rely heavily on the
stationarity assumption and often fail in dynamic environments which undergo
gradual or abrupt changes over time. Yet real-world data are rarely stationary,
and model selection under nonstationarity remains a largely open problem. To
tackle this challenge, we combine conformal inference with model confidence
sets to develop a procedure that adaptively selects models best suited to the
evolving dynamics at any given time. Concretely, the MPS updates in real time a
confidence set of candidate models that covers the best model for the next time
period with a specified long-run probability, while adapting to nonstationarity
of unknown forms. Through simulations and real-world data analysis, we
demonstrate that MPS reliably and efficiently identifies optimal models under
nonstationarity, an essential capability lacking in offline methods. Moreover,
MPS frequently produces high-quality sets with small cardinality, whose
evolution offers deeper insights into changing dynamics. As a generic
framework, MPS accommodates any data-generating process, data structure, model
class, training method, and evaluation metric, making it broadly applicable
across diverse problem settings.

Abstract: Neural Networks (NN) with ReLU activation functions are used to model
multiparametric quadratic optimization problems (mp-QP) in diverse engineering
applications. Researchers have suggested leveraging the piecewise affine
property of deep NN models to solve mp-QP with linear constraints, which also
exhibit piecewise affine behaviour. However, traditional deep NN applications
to mp-QP fall short of providing optimal and feasible predictions, even when
trained on large datasets. This study proposes a partially-supervised NN (PSNN)
architecture that directly represents the mathematical structure of the global
solution function. In contrast to generic NN training approaches, the proposed
PSNN method derives a large proportion of model weights directly from the
mathematical properties of the optimization problem, producing more accurate
solutions despite significantly smaller training data sets. Many energy
management problems are formulated as QP, so we apply the proposed approach to
energy systems (specifically DC optimal power flow) to demonstrate proof of
concept. Model performance in terms of solution accuracy and speed of
predictions was compared against a commercial solver and a generic Deep NN
model based on classical training. Results show KKT sufficient conditions for
PSNN consistently outperform generic NN architectures with classical training
using far less data, including when tested on extreme, out-of-training
distribution test data. Given its speed advantages over traditional solvers,
the PSNN model can quickly produce optimal and feasible solutions within a
second for millions of input parameters sampled from a distribution of
stochastic demands and renewable generator dispatches, which can be used for
simulations and long term planning.

Result: 实验表明该方法计算高效、对模型误设鲁棒，且优于现有非线性DAG学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在非线性ANM下能有效恢复真实因果DAG，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Recent advances have established the identifiability of a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) under additive noise models (ANMs), spurring the development of
various causal discovery methods. However, most existing methods make
restrictive model assumptions, rely heavily on general independence tests, or
require substantial computational time. To address these limitations, we
propose a sequential procedure to orient undirected edges in a completed
partial DAG (CPDAG), representing an equivalence class of DAGs, by leveraging
the pairwise additive noise model (PANM) to identify their causal directions.
We prove that this procedure can recover the true causal DAG assuming a
restricted ANM. Building on this result, we develop a novel constraint-based
algorithm for learning causal DAGs under nonlinear ANMs. Given an estimated
CPDAG, we develop a ranking procedure that sorts undirected edges by their
adherence to the PANM, which defines an evaluation order of the edges. To
determine the edge direction, we devise a statistical test that compares the
log-likelihood values, evaluated with respect to the competing directions, of a
sub-graph comprising just the candidate nodes and their identified parents in
the partial DAG. We further establish the structural learning consistency of
our algorithm in the large-sample limit. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is computationally efficient,
robust to model misspecification, and consistently outperforms many existing
nonlinear DAG learning methods.

Conclusion: Stealix的可扩展性表明，预训练生成模型在模型窃取中的风险可能被低估。

Abstract: Model stealing poses a significant security risk in machine learning by
enabling attackers to replicate a black-box model without access to its
training data, thus jeopardizing intellectual property and exposing sensitive
information. Recent methods that use pre-trained diffusion models for data
synthesis improve efficiency and performance but rely heavily on manually
crafted prompts, limiting automation and scalability, especially for attackers
with little expertise. To assess the risks posed by open-source pre-trained
models, we propose a more realistic threat model that eliminates the need for
prompt design skills or knowledge of class names. In this context, we introduce
Stealix, the first approach to perform model stealing without predefined
prompts. Stealix uses two open-source pre-trained models to infer the victim
model's data distribution, and iteratively refines prompts through a genetic
algorithm, progressively improving the precision and diversity of synthetic
images. Our experimental results demonstrate that Stealix significantly
outperforms other methods, even those with access to class names or
fine-grained prompts, while operating under the same query budget. These
findings highlight the scalability of our approach and suggest that the risks
posed by pre-trained generative models in model stealing may be greater than
previously recognized.

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BiNNs), which employ single-bit precision weights,
have emerged as a promising solution to reduce memory usage and power
consumption while maintaining competitive performance in large-scale systems.
However, training BiNNs remains a significant challenge due to the limitations
of conventional training algorithms. Quantum HyperNetworks offer a novel
paradigm for enhancing the optimization of BiNN by leveraging quantum
computing. Specifically, a Variational Quantum Algorithm is employed to
generate binary weights through quantum circuit measurements, while key quantum
phenomena such as superposition and entanglement facilitate the exploration of
a broader solution space. In this work, we establish a connection between this
approach and Bayesian inference by deriving the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO),
when direct access to the output distribution is available (i.e., in
simulations), and introducing a surrogate ELBO based on the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) metric for scenarios involving implicit distributions, as
commonly encountered in practice. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed methods outperform standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE),
improving trainability and generalization.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning, despite its popularity and empirical
success, faces significant scalability challenges in large-population dynamic
games. Graphon mean field games (GMFGs) offer a principled framework for
approximating such games while capturing heterogeneity among players. In this
paper, we propose and analyze a policy optimization framework for
continuous-time, finite-horizon linear-quadratic GMFGs. Exploiting the
structural properties of GMFGs, we design an efficient policy parameterization
in which each player's policy is represented as an affine function of their
private state, with a shared slope function and player-specific intercepts. We
develop a bilevel optimization algorithm that alternates between policy
gradient updates for best-response computation under a fixed population
distribution, and distribution updates using the resulting policies. We prove
linear convergence of the policy gradient steps to best-response policies and
establish global convergence of the overall algorithm to the Nash equilibrium.
The analysis relies on novel landscape characterizations over
infinite-dimensional policy spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm under varying graphon
structures, noise levels, and action frequencies.

Abstract: Signal restoration and inverse problems are key elements in most real-world
data science applications. In the past decades, with the emergence of machine
learning methods, inversion of measurements has become a popular step in almost
all physical applications, which is normally executed prior to downstream tasks
that often involve parameter estimation. In this work, we analyze the general
problem of parameter estimation in an inverse problem setting. First, we
address the domain-shift problem by re-formulating it in direct relation with
the discrete parameter estimation analysis. We analyze a significant
vulnerability in current attempts to enforce domain generalization, which we
dubbed the Double Meaning Theorem. Our theoretical findings are experimentally
illustrated for domain shift examples in image deblurring and speckle
suppression in medical imaging. We then proceed to a theoretical analysis of
parameter estimation given observed measurements before and after data
processing involving an inversion of the observations. We compare this setting
for invertible and non-invertible (degradation) processes. We distinguish
between continuous and discrete parameter estimation, corresponding with
regression and classification problems, respectively. Our theoretical findings
align with the well-known information-theoretic data processing inequality, and
to a certain degree question the common misconception that data-processing for
inversion, based on modern generative models that may often produce outstanding
perceptual quality, will necessarily improve the following parameter estimation
objective. It is our hope that this paper will provide practitioners with
deeper insights that may be leveraged in the future for the development of more
efficient and informed strategic system planning, critical in safety-sensitive
applications.

Abstract: The availability of big data has significantly influenced the possibilities
and methodological choices for conducting large-scale behavioural and social
science research. In the context of qualitative data analysis, a major
challenge is that conventional methods require intensive manual labour and are
often impractical to apply to large datasets. One effective way to address this
issue is by integrating emerging computational methods to overcome scalability
limitations. However, a critical concern for researchers is the trustworthiness
of results when Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools are used to analyse such data. We argue that confidence in the
credibility and robustness of results depends on adopting a 'human-in-the-loop'
methodology that is able to provide researchers with control over the
analytical process, while retaining the benefits of using ML and NLP. With this
in mind, we propose a novel methodological framework for Computational Grounded
Theory (CGT) that supports the analysis of large qualitative datasets, while
maintaining the rigour of established Grounded Theory (GT) methodologies. To
illustrate the framework's value, we present the results of testing it on a
dataset collected from Reddit in a study aimed at understanding tutors'
experiences in the gig economy.

Abstract: Cooperative autonomous robotic systems have significant potential for
executing complex multi-task missions across space, air, ground, and maritime
domains. But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous
environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile
or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning
algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning
shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when
formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1)
are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location;
2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with
variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board
deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a
novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and
develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and
Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple
example of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the
time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic
solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves
the way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.

Abstract: A recent breakthrough in biologically-plausible normative frameworks for
dimensionality reduction is based upon the similarity matching cost function
and the low-rank matrix approximation problem. Despite clear biological
interpretation, successful application in several domains, and experimental
validation, a formal complete convergence analysis remains elusive. Building on
this framework, we consider and analyze a continuous-time neural network, the
\emph{similarity matching network}, for principal subspace projection. Derived
from a min-max-min objective, this biologically-plausible network consists of
three coupled dynamics evolving at different time scales: neural dynamics,
lateral synaptic dynamics, and feedforward synaptic dynamics at the fast,
intermediate, and slow time scales, respectively. The feedforward and lateral
synaptic dynamics consist of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules,
respectively. By leveraging a multilevel optimization framework, we prove
convergence of the dynamics in the offline setting. Specifically, at the first
level (fast time scale), we show strong convexity of the cost function and
global exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics. At
the second level (intermediate time scale), we prove strong concavity of the
cost function and exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow
dynamics within the space of positive definite matrices. At the third and final
level (slow time scale), we study a non-convex and non-smooth cost function,
provide explicit expressions for its global minima, and prove almost sure
convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics to the global minima.
These results rely on two empirically motivated conjectures that are supported
by thorough numerical experiments. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of
our approach via a numerical example.

Abstract: Health indicator (HI) plays a key role in degradation assessment and
prognostics of rolling bearings. Although various HI construction methods have
been investigated, most of them rely on expert knowledge for feature extraction
and overlook capturing dynamic information hidden in sequential degradation
processes, which limits the ability of the constructed HI for degradation trend
representation and prognostics. To address these concerns, a novel dynamic HI
that considers HI-level temporal dependence is constructed through an
unsupervised framework. Specifically, a degradation feature learning module
composed of a skip-connection-based autoencoder first maps raw signals to a
representative degradation feature space (DFS) to automatically extract
essential degradation features without the need for expert knowledge.
Subsequently, in this DFS, a new HI-generating module embedded with an inner
HI-prediction block is proposed for dynamic HI construction, where the temporal
dependence between past and current HI states is guaranteed and modeled
explicitly. On this basis, the dynamic HI captures the inherent dynamic
contents of the degradation process, ensuring its effectiveness for degradation
tendency modeling and future degradation prognostics. The experiment results on
two bearing lifecycle datasets demonstrate that the proposed HI construction
method outperforms comparison methods, and the constructed dynamic HI is
superior for prognostic tasks.

Metrical Task Systems (MTS), where each might be tailored to a different type
of input instances. While processing an input instance received online, we are
allowed to query the action of only one of the heuristics at each time step.
Our goal is to achieve performance comparable to the best of the given
heuristics. The main difficulty of our setting comes from the fact that the
cost paid by a heuristic at time $t$ cannot be estimated unless the same
heuristic was also queried at time $t-1$. This is related to Bandit Learning
against memory bounded adversaries (Arora et al., 2012). We show how to achieve
regret of $O(\text{OPT}^{2/3})$ and prove a tight lower bound based on the
construction of Dekel et al. (2013).

Abstract: Subsurface property neural network reparameterized full waveform inversion
(FWI) has emerged as an effective unsupervised learning framework, which can
invert stably with an inaccurate starting model. It updates the trainable
neural network parameters instead of fine-tuning on the subsurface model
directly. There are primarily two ways to embed the prior knowledge of the
initial model into neural networks, that is, pretraining and denormalization.
Pretraining first regulates the neural networks' parameters by fitting the
initial velocity model; Denormalization directly adds the outputs of the
network into the initial models without pretraining. In this letter, we
systematically investigate the influence of the two ways of initial model
incorporation for the neural network reparameterized FWI. We demonstrate that
pretraining requires inverting the model perturbation based on a constant
velocity value (mean) with a two-stage implementation. It leads to a complex
workflow and inconsistency of objective functions in the two-stage process,
causing the network parameters to become inactive and lose plasticity.
Experimental results demonstrate that denormalization can simplify workflows,
accelerate convergence, and enhance inversion accuracy compared with
pretraining.

Abstract: In this work we consider generic Gaussian Multi-index models, in which the
labels only depend on the (Gaussian) $d$-dimensional inputs through their
projection onto a low-dimensional $r = O_d(1)$ subspace, and we study efficient
agnostic estimation procedures for this hidden subspace. We introduce the
\emph{generative leap} exponent $k^\star$, a natural extension of the
generative exponent from [Damian et al.'24] to the multi-index setting. We
first show that a sample complexity of $n=\Theta(d^{1 \vee \k/2})$ is necessary
in the class of algorithms captured by the Low-Degree-Polynomial framework. We
then establish that this sample complexity is also sufficient, by giving an
agnostic sequential estimation procedure (that is, requiring no prior knowledge
of the multi-index model) based on a spectral U-statistic over appropriate
Hermite tensors. We further compute the generative leap exponent for several
examples including piecewise linear functions (deep ReLU networks with bias),
and general deep neural networks (with $r$-dimensional first hidden layer).

Conclusion: 结合对称性和物理约束的模型表现最佳，且能更好地泛化到训练数据范围之外。

Abstract: Neural PDE surrogates can improve the cost-accuracy tradeoff of classical
solvers, but often generalize poorly to new initial conditions and accumulate
errors over time. Physical and symmetry constraints have shown promise in
closing this performance gap, but existing techniques for imposing these
inductive biases are incompatible with the staggered grids commonly used in
computational fluid dynamics. Here we introduce novel input and output layers
that respect physical laws and symmetries on the staggered grids, and for the
first time systematically investigate how these constraints, individually and
in combination, affect the accuracy of PDE surrogates. We focus on two
challenging problems: shallow water equations with closed boundaries and
decaying incompressible turbulence. Compared to strong baselines, symmetries
and physical constraints consistently improve performance across tasks,
architectures, autoregressive prediction steps, accuracy measures, and network
sizes. Symmetries are more effective than physical constraints, but surrogates
with both performed best, even compared to baselines with data augmentation or
pushforward training, while themselves benefiting from the pushforward trick.
Doubly-constrained surrogates also generalize better to initial conditions and
durations beyond the range of the training data, and more accurately predict
real-world ocean currents.

Abstract: Inverse folding models have proven to be highly effective zero-shot
predictors of protein stability. Despite this success, the link between the
amino acid preferences of an inverse folding model and the free-energy
considerations underlying thermodynamic stability remains incompletely
understood. A better understanding would be of interest not only from a
theoretical perspective, but also potentially provide the basis for stronger
zero-shot stability prediction. In this paper, we take steps to clarify the
free-energy foundations of inverse folding models. Our derivation reveals the
standard practice of likelihood ratios as a simplistic approximation and
suggests several paths towards better estimates of the relative stability. We
empirically assess these approaches and demonstrate that considerable gains in
zero-shot performance can be achieved with fairly simple means.

Abstract: The singular values of convolutional mappings encode interesting spectral
properties, which can be used, e.g., to improve generalization and robustness
of convolutional neural networks as well as to facilitate model compression.
However, the computation of singular values is typically very
resource-intensive. The naive approach involves unrolling the convolutional
mapping along the input and channel dimensions into a large and sparse
two-dimensional matrix, making the exact calculation of all singular values
infeasible due to hardware limitations. In particular, this is true for
matrices that represent convolutional mappings with large inputs and a high
number of channels. Existing efficient methods leverage the Fast Fourier
transformation (FFT) to transform convolutional mappings into the frequency
domain, enabling the computation of singular values for matrices representing
convolutions with larger input and channel dimensions. For a constant number of
channels in a given convolution, an FFT can compute N singular values in O(N
log N) complexity. In this work, we propose an approach of complexity O(N)
based on local Fourier analysis, which additionally exploits the shift
invariance of convolutional operators. We provide a theoretical analysis of our
algorithm's runtime and validate its efficiency through numerical experiments.
Our results demonstrate that our proposed method is scalable and offers a
practical solution to calculate the entire set of singular values - along with
the corresponding singular vectors if needed - for high-dimensional
convolutional mappings.

Abstract: The ability to design molecules while preserving similarity to a target
molecule and/or property is crucial for various applications in drug discovery,
chemical design, and biology. We introduce in this paper an efficient
training-free method for navigating and sampling from the molecular space with
a generative Chemical Language Model (CLM), while using the molecular
similarity to the target as a guide. Our method leverages the contextual
representations learned from the CLM itself to estimate the molecular
similarity, which is then used to adjust the autoregressive sampling strategy
of the CLM. At each step of the decoding process, the method tracks the
distance of the current generations from the target and updates the logits to
encourage the preservation of similarity in generations. We implement the
method using a recently proposed $\sim$47M parameter SMILES-based CLM,
GP-MoLFormer, and therefore refer to the method as GP-MoLFormer-Sim, which
enables a test-time update of the deep generative policy to reflect the
contextual similarity to a set of guide molecules. The method is further
integrated into a genetic algorithm (GA) and tested on a set of standard
molecular optimization benchmarks involving property optimization, molecular
rediscovery, and structure-based drug design. Results show that,
GP-MoLFormer-Sim, combined with GA (GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA) outperforms existing
training-free baseline methods, when the oracle remains black-box. The findings
in this work are a step forward in understanding and guiding the generative
mechanisms of CLMs.

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle in preserving high-frequency
components of nodal signals when dealing with directed graphs. Such components
are crucial for modeling flow dynamics, without which a traditional GNN tends
to treat a graph with forward and reverse topologies equal.To make GNNs
sensitive to those high-frequency components thereby being capable to capture
detailed topological differences, this paper proposes a novel framework that
combines 1) explicit difference matrices that model directional gradients and
2) implicit physical constraints that enforce messages passing within GNNs to
be consistent with natural laws. Evaluations on two real-world directed graph
data, namely, water flux network and urban traffic flow network, demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposal.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic's severe impact highlighted the need for accurate,

However, most forecasting models struggled, especially during variant surges,
when they were needed most. This study introduces a novel Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) framework for forecasting daily state-level incident
hospitalizations in the United States. We present a spatiotemporal feature,
Social Proximity to Hospitalizations (SPH), derived from Facebook's Social
Connectedness Index to improve forecasts. SPH serves as a proxy for interstate
population interaction, capturing transmission dynamics across space and time.
Our parallel LSTM architecture captures both short- and long-term temporal
dependencies, and our multi-horizon ensembling strategy balances consistency
and forecasting error. Evaluation against COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble models
during the Delta and Omicron surges reveals superiority of our model. On
average, our model surpasses the ensemble by 27, 42, 54, and 69
hospitalizations per state on the $7^{th}$, $14^{th}$, $21^{st}$, and $28^{th}$
forecast days, respectively, during the Omicron surge. Data-ablation
experiments confirm SPH's predictive power, highlighting its effectiveness in
enhancing forecasting models. This research not only advances hospitalization

Result: 实验表明，flowOE在不同市场条件下均优于专家模型和传统基准，实现了更高利润和更低风险。

Conclusion: flowOE展示了在动态最优执行问题中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Optimal execution in financial markets refers to the process of strategically
transacting a large volume of assets over a period to achieve the best possible
outcome by balancing the trade-off between market impact costs and timing or
volatility risks. Traditional optimal execution strategies, such as static
Almgren-Chriss models, often prove suboptimal in dynamic financial markets.
This paper propose flowOE, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow
matching models, to address these limitations. FlowOE learns from a diverse set
of expert traditional strategies and adaptively selects the most suitable
expert behavior for prevailing market conditions. A key innovation is the
incorporation of a refining loss function during the imitation process,
enabling flowOE not only to mimic but also to improve upon the learned expert
actions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply flow
matching models in a stochastic optimal execution problem. Empirical
evaluations across various market conditions demonstrate that flowOE
significantly outperforms both the specifically calibrated expert models and
other traditional benchmarks, achieving higher profits with reduced risk. These
results underscore the practical applicability and potential of flowOE to
enhance adaptive optimal execution.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency price dynamics are driven largely by microstructural supply
demand imbalances in the limit order book (LOB), yet the highly noisy nature of
LOB data complicates the signal extraction process. Prior research has
demonstrated that deep-learning architectures can yield promising predictive
performance on pre-processed equity and futures LOB data, but they often treat
model complexity as an unqualified virtue. In this paper, we aim to examine
whether adding extra hidden layers or parameters to "blackbox ish" neural
networks genuinely enhances short term price forecasting, or if gains are
primarily attributable to data preprocessing and feature engineering. We
benchmark a spectrum of models from interpretable baselines, logistic
regression, XGBoost to deep architectures (DeepLOB, Conv1D+LSTM) on BTC/USDT
LOB snapshots sampled at 100 ms to multi second intervals using publicly
available Bybit data. We introduce two data filtering pipelines (Kalman,
Savitzky Golay) and evaluate both binary (up/down) and ternary (up/flat/down)
labeling schemes. Our analysis compares models on out of sample accuracy,
latency, and robustness to noise. Results reveal that, with data preprocessing
and hyperparameter tuning, simpler models can match and even exceed the
performance of more complex networks, offering faster inference and greater
interpretability.

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is a critical component of modern drug discovery, yet
most existing methods--whether physics-based or deep learning-based--are
developed around holo protein structures with known ligand-bound pockets.
Consequently, their performance degrades significantly on apo or predicted
structures such as those from AlphaFold2, which are more representative of
real-world early-stage drug discovery, where pocket information is often
missing. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-and-aggregation framework to
enable accurate virtual screening under structural uncertainty. Our method
comprises two core components: (1) a tri-modal contrastive learning module that
aligns representations of the ligand, the holo pocket, and cavities detected
from structures, thereby enhancing robustness to pocket localization error; and
(2) a cross-attention based adapter for dynamically aggregating candidate
binding sites, enabling the model to learn from activity data even without
precise pocket annotations. We evaluated our method on a newly curated
benchmark of apo structures, where it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in blind apo setting, improving the early enrichment
factor (EF1%) from 11.75 to 37.19. Notably, it also maintains strong
performance on holo structures. These results demonstrate the promise of our
approach in advancing first-in-class drug discovery, particularly in scenarios
lacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes.

Abstract: Simulating collisions of deformable objects is a fundamental yet challenging
task due to the complexity of modeling solid mechanics and multi-body

equivariance to physical symmetries, inadequate handling of collisions, and
limited scalability. Here we introduce EqCollide, the first end-to-end

velocity into latent control points. A subsequent equivariant Graph Neural
Network-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation models the interactions
among control points via collision-aware message passing. To reconstruct
velocity fields, we query a neural field conditioned on control point features,
enabling continuous and resolution-independent motion predictions. Experimental
results show that EqCollide achieves accurate, stable, and scalable simulations
across diverse object configurations, and our model achieves 24.34% to 35.82%
lower rollout MSE even compared with the best-performing baseline model.
Furthermore, our model could generalize to more colliding objects and extended
temporal horizons, and stay robust to input transformed with group action.

Conclusion: WDAN是一种模型无关的框架，能有效处理时间序列预测中的非平稳性问题。

Abstract: Forecasting non-stationary time series is a challenging task because their
statistical properties often change over time, making it hard for deep models
to generalize well. Instance-level normalization techniques can help address
shifts in temporal distribution. However, most existing methods overlook the
multi-component nature of time series, where different components exhibit
distinct non-stationary behaviors. In this paper, we propose Wavelet-based
Disentangled Adaptive Normalization (WDAN), a model-agnostic framework designed
to address non-stationarity in time series forecasting. WDAN uses discrete
wavelet transforms to break down the input into low-frequency trends and
high-frequency fluctuations. It then applies tailored normalization strategies
to each part. For trend components that exhibit strong non-stationarity, we
apply first-order differencing to extract stable features used for predicting
normalization parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that WDAN consistently improves forecasting accuracy across various
backbone model. Code is available at this repository:

Abstract: Clustering ensemble has emerged as an important research topic in the field
of machine learning. Although numerous methods have been proposed to improve
clustering quality, most existing approaches overlook the need for
interpretability in high-stakes applications. In domains such as medical
diagnosis and financial risk assessment, algorithms must not only be accurate
but also interpretable to ensure transparent and trustworthy decision-making.
Therefore, to fill the gap of lack of interpretable algorithms in the field of
clustering ensemble, we propose the first interpretable clustering ensemble
algorithm in the literature. By treating base partitions as categorical
variables, our method constructs a decision tree in the original feature space
and use the statistical association test to guide the tree building process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves comparable
performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) clustering ensemble methods while
maintaining an additional feature of interpretability. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first interpretable algorithm specifically designed for
clustering ensemble, offering a new perspective for future research in
interpretable clustering.

Abstract: Millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide, collecting the total
power consumed by individual households. Based on these data, electricity
suppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback
on the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates
have relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly
consumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership.
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a
household's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power
for individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM
are based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire
household consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world
smart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each
segmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper
introduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new
subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the
distribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only
on the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world
datasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches.
Our solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's
(Electricit\'e De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed
insights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power
consumption. This paper appeared in KDD 2025.

Abstract: Improving smart grid system management is crucial in the fight against
climate change, and enabling consumers to play an active role in this effort is
a significant challenge for electricity suppliers. In this regard, millions of
smart meters have been deployed worldwide in the last decade, recording the
main electricity power consumed in individual households. This data produces
valuable information that can help them reduce their electricity footprint;
nevertheless, the collected signal aggregates the consumption of the different
appliances running simultaneously in the house, making it difficult to
apprehend. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) refers to the challenge of
estimating the power consumption, pattern, or on/off state activation of
individual appliances using the main smart meter signal. Recent methods
proposed to tackle this task are based on a fully supervised deep-learning
approach that requires both the aggregate signal and the ground truth of
individual appliance power. However, such labels are expensive to collect and
extremely scarce in practice, as they require conducting intrusive surveys in
households to monitor each appliance. In this paper, we introduce CamAL, a
weakly supervised approach for appliance pattern localization that only
requires information on the presence of an appliance in a household to be
trained. CamAL merges an ensemble of deep-learning classifiers combined with an
explainable classification method to be able to localize appliance patterns.
Our experimental evaluation, conducted on 4 real-world datasets, demonstrates
that CamAL significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised baselines and
that current SotA fully supervised NILM approaches require significantly more
labels to reach CamAL performances. The source of our experiments is available

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in car-following modeling lies in accurately
representing the multi-scale complexity of driving behaviors, particularly the
intra-driver heterogeneity where a single driver's actions fluctuate
dynamically under varying conditions. While existing models, both conventional
and data-driven, address behavioral heterogeneity to some extent, they often
emphasize inter-driver heterogeneity or rely on simplified assumptions,
limiting their ability to capture the dynamic heterogeneity of a single driver
under different driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose a novel
data-driven car-following framework that systematically embeds discrete driving
regimes (e.g., steady-state following, acceleration, cruising) into vehicular
motion predictions. Leveraging high-resolution traffic trajectory datasets, the
proposed hybrid deep learning architecture combines Gated Recurrent Units for
discrete driving regime classification with Long Short-Term Memory networks for
continuous kinematic prediction, unifying discrete decision-making processes
and continuous vehicular dynamics to comprehensively represent inter- and
intra-driver heterogeneity. Driving regimes are identified using a bottom-up
segmentation algorithm and Dynamic Time Warping, ensuring robust
characterization of behavioral states across diverse traffic scenarios.
Comparative analyses demonstrate that the framework significantly reduces
prediction errors for acceleration (maximum MSE improvement reached 58.47\%),
speed, and spacing metrics while reproducing critical traffic phenomena, such
as stop-and-go wave propagation and oscillatory dynamics.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) serve as the cornerstone of
mathematical physics. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
have significantly reduced the dependence on large datasets by embedding
physical laws directly into the training of neural networks. However, when
dealing with complex problems, the accuracy of PINNs still has room for
improvement. To address this issue, we introduce the Over-PINNs framework,
which leverages automatic differentiation (AD) to generate higher-order
auxiliary equations that impose additional physical constraints. These
equations are incorporated as extra loss terms in the training process,
effectively enhancing the model's ability to capture physical information
through an "overdetermined" approach. Numerical results illustrate that this
method exhibits strong versatility in solving various types of PDEs. It
achieves a significant improvement in solution accuracy without incurring
substantial additional computational costs.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the impact of road maintenance schedules on traffic
conditions is important because maintenance operations can substantially worsen
congestion if not carefully planned. Reliable estimates allow planners to avoid
excessive delays during periods of roadwork. Since the exact increase in
congestion is difficult to predict analytically, traffic simulations are
commonly used to assess the redistribution of the flow of traffic. However,
when applied to long-term maintenance planning involving many overlapping
projects and scheduling alternatives, these simulations must be run thousands
of times, resulting in a significant computational burden. This paper
investigates the use of machine learning-based surrogate models to predict
network-wide congestion caused by simultaneous road renovations. We frame the
problem as a supervised learning task, using one-hot encodings, engineered
traffic features, and heuristic approximations. A range of linear,
ensemble-based, probabilistic, and neural regression models is evaluated under
an online learning framework in which data progressively becomes available. The
experimental results show that the Costliest Subset Heuristic provides a
reasonable approximation when limited training data is available, and that most
regression models fail to outperform it, with the exception of XGBoost, which
achieves substantially better accuracy. In overall performance, XGBoost
significantly outperforms alternatives in a range of metrics, most strikingly
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Pinball loss, where it achieves a
MAPE of 11% and outperforms the next-best model by 20% and 38% respectively.
This modeling approach has the potential to reduce the computational burden of
large-scale traffic assignment problems in maintenance planning.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting is key for all business planning. When estimated sales
are too high, brick-and-mortar retailers may incur higher costs due to unsold
inventories, higher labor and storage space costs, etc. On the other hand, when
forecasts underestimate the level of sales, firms experience lost sales,
shortages, and impact on the reputation of the retailer in their relevant
market. Accurate forecasting presents a competitive advantage for companies. It
facilitates the achievement of revenue and profit goals and execution of
pricing strategy and tactics. In this study, we provide an exhaustive
assessment of the forecasting models applied to a high-resolution
brick-and-mortar retail dataset. Our forecasting framework addresses the
problems found in retail environments, including intermittent demand, missing
values, and frequent product turnover. We compare tree-based ensembles (such as
XGBoost and LightGBM) and state-of-the-art neural network architectures
(including N-BEATS, NHITS, and the Temporal Fusion Transformer) across various
experimental settings. Our results show that localized modeling strategies
especially those using tree-based models on individual groups with non-imputed
data, consistently deliver superior forecasting accuracy and computational
efficiency. In contrast, neural models benefit from advanced imputation
methods, yet still fall short in handling the irregularities typical of
physical retail data. These results further practical understanding for model
selection in retail environment and highlight the significance of data
preprocessing to improve forecast performance.

Abstract: Although deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning
from unstructured data, modern tree-based ensemble models remain superior in
extracting relevant information and learning from structured datasets. While
several efforts have been made to accelerate tree-based models, the inherent
characteristics of the models pose significant challenges for conventional
accelerators. Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM)
offers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing
designs suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work
addresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework
that significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model
inference. We propose an iterative pruning algorithm with a novel pruning
criterion tailored for bagging-based models (e.g., Random Forest), which
minimizes model complexity while ensuring controlled accuracy degradation.
Additionally, we present a tree mapping scheme that incorporates two innovative
data placement strategies to alleviate the memory redundancy caused by the
widespread use of don't care states in CAM. Experimental results show that
implementing the tree mapping scheme alone achieves $1.46\times$ to $21.30
\times$ better space efficiency, while the full RETENTION framework yields
$4.35\times$ to $207.12\times$ improvement with less than 3% accuracy loss.
These results demonstrate that RETENTION is highly effective in reducing CAM
capacity requirement, providing a resource-efficient direction for tree-based
model acceleration.

Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs), employing automation and machine learning (ML) to
accelerate experimental procedures, have enormous potential in the discovery of
new materials. However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to
solution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access
the broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL
based on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks,
obtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded
thin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to
systematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven
approach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and
sputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition
distribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ
measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter
chamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of
the sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using
Gaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of
the deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of
the deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We
investigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully
Bayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best
performance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10
experiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions
was verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by
avoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus
demonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials
exploration.

Abstract: Scientific computing for large deformation of elastic-plastic solids is
critical for numerous real-world applications. Classical numerical solvers rely
primarily on local discrete linear approximation and are constrained by an
inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Recently, deep learning
models have achieved impressive progress in solving the continuum mechanism.
While previous models have explored various architectures and constructed
coefficient-solution mappings, they are designed for general instances without
considering specific problem properties and hard to accurately handle with
complex elastic-plastic solids involving contact, loading and unloading. In
this work, we take stretch bending, a popular metal fabrication technique, as
our case study and introduce LaDEEP, a deep learning-based surrogate model for
\textbf{La}rge \textbf{De}formation of \textbf{E}lastic-\textbf{P}lastic
Solids. We encode the partitioned regions of the involved slender solids into a
token sequence to maintain their essential order property. To characterize the
physical process of the solid deformation, a two-stage Transformer-based module
is designed to predict the deformation with the sequence of tokens as input.
Empirically, LaDEEP achieves five magnitudes faster speed than finite element
methods with a comparable accuracy, and gains 20.47\% relative improvement on
average compared to other deep learning baselines. We have also deployed our
model into a real-world industrial production system, and it has shown

Abstract: Multi-solid systems are foundational to a wide range of real-world
applications, yet modeling their complex interactions remains challenging.
Existing deep learning methods predominantly rely on implicit modeling, where
the factors influencing solid deformation are not explicitly represented but
are instead indirectly learned. However, as the number of solids increases,
these methods struggle to accurately capture intricate physical interactions.
In this paper, we introduce a novel explicit modeling paradigm that
incorporates factors influencing solid deformation through structured modules.
Specifically, we present Unisoma, a unified and flexible Transformer-based
model capable of handling variable numbers of solids. Unisoma directly captures
physical interactions using contact modules and adaptive interaction allocation
mechanism, and learns the deformation through a triplet relationship. Compared
to implicit modeling techniques, explicit modeling is more well-suited for
multi-solid systems with diverse coupling patterns, as it enables detailed
treatment of each solid while preventing information blending and confusion.
Experimentally, Unisoma achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across
seven well-established datasets and two complex multi-solid tasks. Code is

Abstract: Solving time-dependent parametric partial differential equations (PDEs)
remains a fundamental challenge for neural solvers, particularly when
generalizing across a wide range of physical parameters and dynamics. When data
is uncertain or incomplete-as is often the case-a natural approach is to turn
to generative models. We introduce ENMA, a generative neural operator designed
to model spatio-temporal dynamics arising from physical phenomena. ENMA
predicts future dynamics in a compressed latent space using a generative masked
autoregressive transformer trained with flow matching loss, enabling tokenwise
generation. Irregularly sampled spatial observations are encoded into uniform
latent representations via attention mechanisms and further compressed through
a spatio-temporal convolutional encoder. This allows ENMA to perform in-context
learning at inference time by conditioning on either past states of the target
trajectory or auxiliary context trajectories with similar dynamics. The result
is a robust and adaptable framework that generalizes to new PDE regimes and
supports one-shot surrogate modeling of time-dependent parametric PDEs.

Abstract: The modeling and control of single-phase flow systems governed by Partial

Control (PINC) framework, originally proposed to modeling and control of
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) without the need of any labeled data, to
the PDE case, particularly to single-phase incompressible and compressible
flows, integrating neural networks with physical conservation laws. The PINC
model for PDEs is structured into two stages: a steady-state network, which
learns equilibrium solutions for a wide range of control inputs, and a
transient network, which captures dynamic responses under time-varying boundary
conditions. We propose a simplifying assumption that reduces the dimensionality
of the spatial coordinate regarding the initial condition, allowing the
efficient training of the PINC network. This simplification enables the
derivation of optimal control policies using Model Predictive Control (MPC). We
validate our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating that the
PINC model, which is trained exclusively using physical laws, i.e., without
labeled data, accurately represents flow dynamics and enables real-time control
applications. The results highlight the PINC's capability to efficiently
approximate PDE solutions without requiring iterative solvers, making it a
promising alternative for fluid flow monitoring and optimization in engineering

Result: 时间表征学习能重新发现临床相关患者群，但任务仍具挑战性（v-measure最高0.46，最低0.40）。

Conclusion: ICU-TSB为患者分层提供了可复现的基准，并探索了聚类标签的可解释性策略。

Abstract: Patient stratification identifying clinically meaningful subgroups is
essential for advancing personalized medicine through improved diagnostics and
treatment strategies. Electronic health records (EHRs), particularly those from
intensive care units (ICUs), contain rich temporal clinical data that can be
leveraged for this purpose. In this work, we introduce ICU-TSB (Temporal
Stratification Benchmark), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
patient stratification based on temporal patient representation learning using
three publicly available ICU EHR datasets. A key contribution of our benchmark
is a novel hierarchical evaluation framework utilizing disease taxonomies to
measure the alignment of discovered clusters with clinically validated disease
groupings. In our experiments with ICU-TSB, we compared statistical methods and
several recurrent neural networks, including LSTM and GRU, for their ability to
generate effective patient representations for subsequent clustering of patient
trajectories. Our results demonstrate that temporal representation learning can
rediscover clinically meaningful patient cohorts; nevertheless, it remains a
challenging task, with v-measuring varying from up to 0.46 at the top level of
the taxonomy to up to 0.40 at the lowest level. To further enhance the
practical utility of our findings, we also evaluate multiple strategies for
assigning interpretable labels to the identified clusters. The experiments and
benchmark are fully reproducible and available at

Abstract: Within wind farms, wake effects between turbines can significantly reduce
overall energy production. Wind farm flow control encompasses methods designed
to mitigate these effects through coordinated turbine control. Wake steering,
for example, consists in intentionally misaligning certain turbines with the
wind to optimize airflow and increase power output. However, designing a robust
wake steering controller remains challenging, and existing machine learning
approaches are limited to quasi-static wind conditions or small wind farms.
This work presents a new deep reinforcement learning methodology to develop a
wake steering policy that overcomes these limitations. Our approach introduces
a novel architecture that combines graph attention networks and multi-head
self-attention blocks, alongside a novel reward function and training strategy.
The resulting model computes the yaw angles of each turbine, optimizing energy
production in time-varying wind conditions. An empirical study conducted on
steady-state, low-fidelity simulation, shows that our model requires
approximately 10 times fewer training steps than a fully connected neural
network and achieves more robust performance compared to a strong optimization
baseline, increasing energy production by up to 14 %. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first deep reinforcement learning-based wake steering
controller to generalize effectively across any time-varying wind conditions in
a low-fidelity, steady-state numerical simulation setting.

Conclusion: 安全投标策略在实践中具有吸引力，能够有效满足RoI约束并实现价值最大化。

Abstract: We study the bidding problem in repeated uniform price multi-unit auctions
from the perspective of a single value-maximizing buyer who aims to maximize
their cumulative value over $T$ rounds while adhering to return-on-investment
(RoI) constraints in each round. Buyers adopt $m$-uniform bidding format, where
they submit $m$ bid-quantity pairs $(b_i, q_i)$ to demand $q_i$ units at bid
$b_i$. We introduce safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy RoI
constraints in every auction, regardless of competing bids. We show that these
strategies depend only on the valuation curve of the bidder, and the bidder can
focus on a finite subset of this class without loss of generality. While the
number of strategies in this subset is exponential in $m$, we develop a
polynomial-time algorithm to learn the optimal safe strategy that achieves
sublinear regret in the online setting, where regret is measured against a
clairvoyant benchmark that knows the competing bids a priori and selects a
fixed hindsight optimal safe strategy. We then evaluate the performance of safe
strategies against a clairvoyant that selects the optimal strategy from a
richer class of strategies in the online setting. In this scenario, we compute
the richness ratio, $\alpha\in(0, 1]$ for the class of strategies chosen by the
clairvoyant and show that our algorithm, designed to learn safe strategies,
achieves $\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret against these stronger
benchmarks. Experiments on semi-synthetic data from real-world auctions show
that safe strategies substantially outperform the derived theoretical bounds,
making them quite appealing in practice.

Conclusion: \acronym是一种有效的联邦差分隐私聚类算法，适用于分布式数据场景。

Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of data analysis that is particularly suited to
identifying coherent subgroups or substructures in unlabeled data, as are
generated continuously in large amounts these days. However, in many cases
traditional clustering methods are not applicable, because data are
increasingly being produced and stored in a distributed way, e.g. on edge
devices, and privacy concerns prevent it from being transferred to a central
server. To address this challenge, we present \acronym, a new algorithm for
$k$-means clustering that is fully-federated as well as differentially private.
Our approach leverages (potentially small and out-of-distribution) server-side
data to overcome the primary challenge of differentially private clustering
methods: the need for a good initialization. Combining our initialization with
a simple federated DP-Lloyds algorithm we obtain an algorithm that achieves
excellent results on synthetic and real-world benchmark tasks. We also provide
a theoretical analysis of our method that provides bounds on the convergence
speed and cluster identification success.

Abstract: Graph-based recommendation systems use higher-order user and item embeddings
for next-item predictions. Dynamically adding collaborative signals from
neighbors helps to use similar users' preferences during learning. While
item-item correlations and their impact on recommendations have been studied,
the efficacy of temporal item sequences for recommendations is much less
explored. In this paper, we examine temporal item sequence (sequel-aware)
embeddings along with higher-order user embeddings and show that sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks have better (or comparable) recommendation performance
than graph-based recommendation systems that do not consider sequel
information. Extensive empirical results comparing Heterogeneous Sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks (HSAL-GNNs) to other algorithms for sequential learning
(such as transformers, graph neural networks, auto-encoders) are presented on
three synthetic and three real-world datasets. Our results indicate that the
incorporation of sequence information from items greatly enhances
recommendations.

Abstract: Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a
crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of
gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations are costly
to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can
emulate the distribution functions of a simulated population of binary
parameters and thereby enable empirical constraints on the astrophysical
initial conditions and branching fractions of various formation channels given
data from a catalog of GW observations. They can also be used for data
amplification in sparse regions of the CBC parameter space to guide the
development of phenomenological population models for rarely synthesizable
systems with components in theorized mass gaps, without having to simulate a
prohibitively large number of binaries. But flow predictions are wrought with
uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work I develop a
method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by
introducing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator
constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function
associated with density estimators I sample the posterior distribution of flow
parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow
uncertainties. I demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, and data-amplification
impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole
populations formed through common envelope evolution. I outline applications of
the methodology in simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and
sketch other uses for general simulation-based approaches in GW astronomy.

Abstract: The development of science has been transforming man's view towards nature
for centuries. Observing structures and patterns in an effective approach to
discover regularities from data is a key step toward theory-building. With
increasingly complex data being obtained, revealing regularities systematically
has become a challenge. Correlation is a most commonly-used and effective
approach to describe regularities in data, yet for complex patterns, spatial
inhomogeneity and complexity can often undermine the correlations. We present
an algorithm to derive maps representing the type and degree of correlations,
by taking the two-fold symmetry of the correlation vector into full account
using the Stokes parameter. The method allows for a spatially resolved view of
the nature and strength of correlations between physical quantities. In the
correlation view, a region can often be separated into different subregions
with different types of correlations. Subregions correspond to physical regimes
for physical systems, or climate zones for climate maps. The simplicity of the
method makes it widely applicable to a variety of data, where the
correlation-based approach makes the map particularly useful in revealing
regularities in physical systems and alike. As a new and efficient approach to
represent data, the method should facilitate the development of new
computational approaches to regularity discovery.

Abstract: The paradigm of Intelligent DataPlane (IDP) embeds deep learning (DL) models
on the network dataplane to enable intelligent traffic analysis at line-speed.
However, the current use of the match-action table (MAT) abstraction on the
dataplane is misaligned with DL inference, leading to several key limitations,
including accuracy degradation, limited scale, and lack of generality. This
paper proposes Pegasus to address these limitations. Pegasus translates DL
operations into three dataplane-oriented primitives to achieve generality:
Partition, Map, and SumReduce. Specifically, Partition "divides"
high-dimensional features into multiple low-dimensional vectors, making them
more suitable for the dataplane; Map "conquers" computations on the
low-dimensional vectors in parallel with the technique of fuzzy matching, while
SumReduce "combines" the computation results. Additionally, Pegasus employs
Primitive Fusion to merge computations, improving scalability. Finally, Pegasus
adopts full precision weights with fixed-point activations to improve accuracy.
Our implementation on a P4 switch demonstrates that Pegasus can effectively
support various types of DL models, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and
AutoEncoder models on the dataplane. Meanwhile, Pegasus outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches with an average accuracy improvement of up to
22.8%, along with up to 248x larger model size and 212x larger input scale.

Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for
Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator.
These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing

simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators
are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that
can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI
which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several
simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through
both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can
significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational

Abstract: Shape assembly, the process of combining parts into a complete whole, is a
crucial robotic skill with broad real-world applications. Among various
assembly tasks, geometric assembly--where broken parts are reassembled into
their original form (e.g., reconstructing a shattered bowl)--is particularly
challenging. This requires the robot to recognize geometric cues for grasping,
assembly, and subsequent bimanual collaborative manipulation on varied
fragments. In this paper, we exploit the geometric generalization of
point-level affordance, learning affordance aware of bimanual collaboration in
geometric assembly with long-horizon action sequences. To address the
evaluation ambiguity caused by geometry diversity of broken parts, we introduce
a real-world benchmark featuring geometric variety and global reproducibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both
previous affordance-based and imitation-based methods. Project page:

prediction, which consists of two components: Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS)
guidance and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance. By this way, MTPNet
dynamically optimizes molecular representations through multi-grained protein
semantic conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first time to employ the
receptor proteins as guiding information to effectively capture critical
interaction details. Extensive experiments on 30 representative activity cliff

Our analysis demonstrates that maximizing device lifespan requires minimizing
wake time. We propose a pipeline that includes data processing, training, and
evaluation of the deep learning model designed for imbalanced, multiclass time
series data collected from an embedded sensor. The method uses a
one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network architecture to classify
accelerometer data from the IoT device. Before training, two data augmentation
techniques are tested to solve the imbalance problem of the dataset: the
Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique and the ADAptive SYNthetic sampling
approach. After training, compression techniques are implemented to have a
small model size. On the considered twoclass problem, the methodology yields a
precision of 94.54% for the first class and 95.83% for the second class, while
compression techniques reduce the model size by a factor of four. The trained
model is deployed on the IoT device, where it operates with a power consumption

Abstract: As a core mechanism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes, protein
post-translational modifications (PTMs) require precise prediction to decipher
dynamic life activity networks. To address the limitations of existing deep
learning models in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and
architectural optimization, this study proposes UniPTMs: the first unified
framework for multi-type PTM prediction. The framework innovatively establishes
a "Master-Slave" dual-path collaborative architecture: The master path
dynamically integrates high-dimensional representations of protein sequences,
structures, and evolutionary information through a Bidirectional Gated
Cross-Attention (BGCA) module, while the slave path optimizes feature
discrepancies and recalibration between structural and traditional features
using a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN). Complemented by a Multi-scale
Adaptive convolutional Pyramid (MACP) for capturing local feature patterns and
a Bidirectional Hierarchical Gated Fusion Network (BHGFN) enabling multi-level
feature integration across paths, the framework employs a Hierarchical Dynamic
Weighting Fusion (HDWF) mechanism to intelligently aggregate multimodal
features. Enhanced by a novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function for
feature consistency optimization, UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance
improvements (3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP increases) over state-of-the-art
models across five modification types and transcends the Single-Type Prediction
Paradigm. To strike a balance between model complexity and performance, we have
also developed a lightweight variant named UniPTMs-mini.

Abstract: In recent years, electricity suppliers have installed millions of smart
meters worldwide to improve the management of the smart grid system. These
meters collect a large amount of electrical consumption data to produce
valuable information to help consumers reduce their electricity footprint.
However, having non-expert users (e.g., consumers or sales advisors) understand
these data and derive usage patterns for different appliances has become a
significant challenge for electricity suppliers because these data record the
aggregated behavior of all appliances. At the same time, ground-truth labels
(which could train appliance detection and localization models) are expensive
to collect and extremely scarce in practice. This paper introduces DeviceScope,
an interactive tool designed to facilitate understanding smart meter data by
detecting and localizing individual appliance patterns within a given time
period. Our system is based on CamAL (Class Activation Map-based Appliance
Localization), a novel weakly supervised approach for appliance localization
that only requires the knowledge of the existence of an appliance in a
household to be trained. This paper appeared in ICDE 2025.

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental health
condition, and a deeper understanding of its neurocognitive foundations is
essential for identifying how core functions such as emotional and
self-referential processing are affected. We investigate how depression alters
the temporal dynamics of emotional processing by measuring neural responses to
self-referential affective sentences using surface electroencephalography (EEG)
in healthy and depressed individuals. Our results reveal significant
group-level differences in neural activity during sentence viewing, suggesting
disrupted integration of emotional and self-referential information in
depression. Deep learning model trained on these responses achieves an area

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering (HC) is an important data analysis technique in which
the goal is to recursively partition a dataset into a tree-like structure while
grouping together similar data points at each level of granularity.
Unfortunately, for many of the proposed HC objectives, there exist strong
barriers to approximation algorithms with the hardness of approximation. Thus,
we consider the problem of hierarchical clustering given auxiliary information
from natural oracles. Specifically, we focus on a *splitting oracle* which,
when provided with a triplet of vertices $(u,v,w)$, answers (possibly
erroneously) the pairs of vertices whose lowest common ancestor includes all
three vertices in an optimal tree, i.e., identifying which vertex ``splits
away'' from the others. Using such an oracle, we obtain the following results:
  - A polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $O(1)$-approximation to the Dasgupta objective (Dasgupta [STOC'16]).
  - A near-linear time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $(1-o(1))$-approximation to the Moseley-Wang objective (Moseley and Wang
[NeurIPS'17]).
  Under the plausible Small Set Expansion Hypothesis, no polynomial-time
algorithm can achieve any constant approximation for Dasgupta's objective or
$(1-C)$-approximation for the Moseley-Wang objective for some constant $C>0$.
As such, our results demonstrate that the splitting oracle enables algorithms
to outperform standard HC approaches and overcome hardness constraints.
Furthermore, our approaches extend to sublinear settings, in which we show new
streaming and PRAM algorithms for HC with improved guarantees.

Abstract: In the identification of new planetary candidates in transit surveys, the
employment of Deep Learning models proved to be essential to efficiently
analyse a continuously growing volume of photometric observations. To further
improve the robustness of these models, it is necessary to exploit the
complementarity of data collected from different transit surveys such as NASA's
Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and, in the near future,
the ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission. In this
work, we present a Deep Learning model, named DART-Vetter, able to distinguish
planetary candidates (PC) from false positives signals (NPC) detected by any
potential transiting survey. DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that
processes only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal,
featuring a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other
triaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and
tested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously
labelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of
our model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive
triaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and
Kepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage. Its compact, open
source and easy to replicate architecture makes DART-Vetter a particularly
useful tool for automatizing triaging procedures or assisting human vetters,
showing a discrete generalization on TCEs with Multiple Event Statistic (MES) >
20 and orbital period < 50 days.

Abstract: Water reuse is a key point when fresh water is a commodity in ever greater
demand, but which is also becoming ever more available. Furthermore, the return
of clean water to its natural environment is also mandatory. Therefore,
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are essential in any policy focused on
these serious challenges.
  WWTPs are complex facilities which need to operate at their best to achieve
their goals. Nowadays, they are largely monitored, generating large databases
of historical data concerning their functioning over time. All this implies a
large amount of embedded information which is not usually easy for plant
managers to assimilate, correlate and understand; in other words, for them to
know the global operation of the plant at any given time. At this point, the
intelligent and Machine Learning (ML) approaches can give support for that
need, managing all the data and translating them into manageable, interpretable
and explainable knowledge about how the WWTP plant is operating at a glance.
  Here, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) based methodology is
proposed and tested for a real WWTP, in order to extract explainable service
knowledge concerning the operation modes of the WWTP managed by AQUAVALL, which
is the public service in charge of the integral water cycle in the City Council
of Valladolid (Castilla y Le\'on, Spain). By applying well-known approaches of
XAI and ML focused on the challenge of WWTP, it has been possible to summarize
a large number of historical databases through a few explained operation modes
of the plant in a low-dimensional data space, showing the variables and
facility units involved in each case.

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing expectation values of local functions
under the Gibbs distribution of a spin system. In particular, we study two
families of linear programming hierarchies for this problem. The first
hierarchy imposes local spin flip equalities and has been considered in the
bootstrap literature in high energy physics. For this hierarchy, we prove fast
convergence under a spatial mixing (decay of correlations) condition. This
condition is satisfied for example above the critical temperature for Ising
models on a $d$-dimensional grid. The second hierarchy is based on a Markov
chain having the Gibbs state as a fixed point and has been studied in the
optimization literature and more recently in the bootstrap literature. For this
hierarchy, we prove fast convergence provided the Markov chain mixes rapidly.
Both hierarchies lead to an $\varepsilon$-approximation for local expectation
values using a linear program of size quasi-polynomial in $n/\varepsilon$,
where $n$ is the total number of sites, provided the interactions can be
embedded in a $d$-dimensional grid with constant $d$. Compared to standard
Monte Carlo methods, an advantage of this approach is that it always (i.e., for
any system) outputs rigorous upper and lower bounds on the expectation value of
interest, without needing an a priori analysis of the convergence speed.

Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has surveyed nearly the
entire sky in Full-Frame Image mode with a time resolution of 200 seconds to 30
minutes and a temporal baseline of at least 27 days. In addition to the primary
goal of discovering new exoplanets, TESS is exceptionally capable at detecting
variable stars, and in particular short-period eclipsing binaries which are
relatively common, making up a few percent of all stars, and represent powerful
astrophysical laboratories for deep investigations of stellar formation and
evolution. We combed Sectors 1-82 of TESS Full-Frame Image data searching for
eclipsing binary stars using a neural network that identified ~1.2 million
stars with eclipse-like features. Of these, we have performed an in-depth
analysis on ~60,000 targets using automated methods and manual inspection by
citizen scientists. Here we present a catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and
-validated eclipsing binary stars that passed all our ephemeris and photocenter
tests, as well as complementary visual inspection. Of these, 7936 are new
eclipsing binaries while the remaining 2065 are known systems for which we
update the published ephemerides. We outline the detection and analysis of the
targets, discuss the properties of the sample, and highlight potentially
interesting systems. Finally, we also provide a list of ~900,000 unvetted and
unvalidated targets for which the neural network found eclipse-like features
with a score higher than 0.9, and for which there are no known eclipsing
binaries within a sky-projected separation of a TESS pixel (~21 arcsec).

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning
algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. These
methods learn the parameters of parametric policies via stochastic gradient
ascent, typically using on-policy trajectory data to estimate the policy
gradient. However, such reliance on fresh data makes them sample-inefficient.
Indeed, vanilla PG methods require $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve
efficiency is to reuse off-policy information from past iterations, such as
previous gradients or trajectories. While gradient reuse has received
substantial theoretical attention, leading to improved rates of
$O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories remains largely unexplored
from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous
theoretical evidence that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can
significantly accelerate convergence in PG methods. We introduce a power mean
correction to the multiple importance weighting estimator and propose RPG
(Retrospective Policy Gradient), a PG algorithm that combines old and new
trajectories for policy updates. Through a novel analysis, we show that, under
established assumptions, RPG achieves a sample complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, the best known rate in the literature. We
further validate empirically our approach against PG methods with
state-of-the-art rates.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Nonstationarity of real-life time series requires model adaptation. In
classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH there is assumed some arbitrarily chosen
dependence type. To avoid their bias, we will focus on novel more agnostic
approach: moving estimator, which estimates parameters separately for every
time $t$: optimizing $F_t=\sum_{\tau<t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta
(x_\tau))$ local log-likelihood with exponentially weakening weights of the old
values. In practice such moving estimates can be found by EMA (exponential
moving average) of some parameters, like $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ absolute central
moments, updated by $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. We
will focus here on its applications for alpha-Stable distribution, which also
influences Hurst exponent, hence can be used for its adaptive estimation. Its
application will be shown on financial data as DJIA time series - beside
standard estimation of evolution of center $\mu$ and scale parameter $\sigma$,
there is also estimated evolution of $\alpha$ parameter allowing to
continuously evaluate market stability - tails having $\rho(x) \sim
1/|x|^{\alpha+1}$ behavior, controlling probability of potentially dangerous
extreme events.
