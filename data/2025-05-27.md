### [1] [Thinking Fast and Right: Balancing Accuracy and Reasoning Length with Adaptive Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18298)
*Jinyan Su,Claire Cardie*

Main category: cs.CL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL训练的LLM在数学任务中常产生冗长推理，增加推理成本和延迟，现有固定惩罚方法难以适应模型能力变化。

Method: 动态调整奖励函数，根据模型表现自适应平衡准确性和输出长度。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著减少推理长度，同时基本保持准确性。

Conclusion: 为大规模语言模型提供了一种成本高效的自适应推理新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in
mathematical tasks, often enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, RL-trained models frequently produce unnecessarily long reasoning
traces -- even for simple queries -- leading to increased inference costs and
latency. While recent approaches attempt to control verbosity by adding length
penalties to the reward function, these methods rely on fixed penalty terms
that are hard to tune and cannot adapt as the model's reasoning capability
evolves, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose an adaptive
reward-shaping method that enables LLMs to "think fast and right" -- producing
concise outputs without sacrificing correctness. Our method dynamically adjusts
the reward trade-off between accuracy and response length based on model
performance: when accuracy is high, the length penalty increases to encourage
faster length reduction; when accuracy drops, the penalty is relaxed to
preserve correctness. This adaptive reward accelerates early-stage length
reduction while avoiding over-compression in later stages. Experiments across
multiple datasets show that our approach consistently and dramatically reduces
reasoning length while largely maintaining accuracy, offering a new direction
for cost-efficient adaptive reasoning in large-scale language models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的混合潜在推理方法HRPO，通过结合离散和连续表示，优化LLM的推理能力，无需依赖CoT轨迹训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在推理虽具潜力，但与LLM的离散自回归生成冲突，且依赖CoT训练。HRPO旨在利用LLM内在能力，通过RL实现混合推理。

Method: HRPO通过可学习门控机制整合隐藏状态与采样令牌，逐步引入隐藏特征训练，结合离散与连续表示。

Result: HRPO在知识和推理任务中优于现有方法，且保持模型可解释性，展现跨语言模式和更短完成长度。

Conclusion: HRPO展示了RL在潜在推理中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced latent
reasoning as a promising alternative to autoregressive reasoning. By performing
internal computation with hidden states from previous steps, latent reasoning
benefit from more informative features rather than sampling a discrete
chain-of-thought (CoT) path. Yet latent reasoning approaches are often
incompatible with LLMs, as their continuous paradigm conflicts with the
discrete nature of autoregressive generation. Moreover, these methods rely on
CoT traces for training and thus fail to exploit the inherent reasoning
patterns of LLMs. In this work, we explore latent reasoning by leveraging the
intrinsic capabilities of LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). To this end, we
introduce hybrid reasoning policy optimization (HRPO), an RL-based hybrid
latent reasoning approach that (1) integrates prior hidden states into sampled
tokens with a learnable gating mechanism, and (2) initializes training with
predominantly token embeddings while progressively incorporating more hidden
features. This design maintains LLMs' generative capabilities and incentivizes
hybrid reasoning using both discrete and continuous representations. In
addition, the hybrid HRPO introduces stochasticity into latent reasoning via
token sampling, thereby enabling RL-based optimization without requiring CoT
trajectories. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks show that HRPO
outperforms prior methods in both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks.
Furthermore, HRPO-trained LLMs remain interpretable and exhibit intriguing
behaviors like cross-lingual patterns and shorter completion lengths,
highlighting the potential of our RL-based approach and offer insights for
future work in latent reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的安全对齐策略CKU，通过定位和保留有用知识、遗忘有害知识，显著提升了LLMs的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在安全对齐方面取得了进展，但仍易受越狱攻击，现有防御机制未能完全消除有害知识。

Method: CKU通过评分MLP层神经元识别有用知识子集U，在遗忘过程中修剪U的梯度以保留有用知识并减少有害内容。

Result: 实验表明，CKU在保持性能的同时显著提升了模型安全性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CKU为安全对齐和模型知识编辑提供了新思路，平衡了安全性与实用性。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in safety alignment, large language models
(LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms
have not fully deleted harmful knowledge in LLMs, which allows such attacks to
bypass safeguards and produce harmful outputs. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel safety alignment strategy, Constrained Knowledge Unlearning
(CKU), which focuses on two primary objectives: knowledge localization and
retention, and unlearning harmful knowledge. CKU works by scoring neurons in
specific multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers to identify a subset U of neurons
associated with useful knowledge. During the unlearning process, CKU prunes the
gradients of neurons in U to preserve valuable knowledge while effectively
mitigating harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that CKU
significantly enhances model safety without compromising overall performance,
offering a superior balance between safety and utility compared to existing
methods. Additionally, our analysis of neuron knowledge sensitivity across
various MLP layers provides valuable insights into the mechanics of safety
alignment and model knowledge editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维LLMs的KV缓存量化在现有方法中会导致性能下降，主要原因是累积误差大和短上下文校准不足。

Method: PM-KVQ采用渐进量化策略和块级内存分配以减少累积误差，并提出基于位置插值的新校准策略。

Result: 在7B-70B的LLMs上，PM-KVQ在相同内存预算下将推理性能提升高达8%。

Conclusion: PM-KVQ有效解决了长链思维LLMs中的KV缓存量化问题，显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in developing reasoning-capable
Large Language Models (LLMs) through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques.
However, this long-CoT reasoning process imposes substantial memory overhead
due to the large Key-Value (KV) Cache memory overhead. Post-training KV Cache
quantization has emerged as a promising compression technique and has been
extensively studied in short-context scenarios. However, directly applying
existing methods to long-CoT LLMs causes significant performance degradation
due to the following two reasons: (1) Large cumulative error: Existing methods
fail to adequately leverage available memory, and they directly quantize the KV
Cache during each decoding step, leading to large cumulative quantization
error. (2) Short-context calibration: Due to Rotary Positional Embedding
(RoPE), the use of short-context data during calibration fails to account for
the distribution of less frequent channels in the Key Cache, resulting in
performance loss. We propose Progressive Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization
(PM-KVQ) for long-CoT LLMs to address the above issues in two folds: (1) To
reduce cumulative error, we design a progressive quantization strategy to
gradually lower the bit-width of KV Cache in each block. Then, we propose
block-wise memory allocation to assign a higher bit-width to more sensitive
transformer blocks. (2) To increase the calibration length without additional
overhead, we propose a new calibration strategy with positional interpolation
that leverages short calibration data with positional interpolation to
approximate the data distribution of long-context data. Extensive experiments
on 7B-70B long-CoT LLMs show that PM-KVQ improves reasoning benchmark
performance by up to 8% over SOTA baselines under the same memory budget. Our
code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/PM-KVQ.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising cornerstone for the
development of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence
(AI). However, ensuring the robustness of LLMs remains a critical challenge. To
address these challenges and advance the field, this survey provides a

conceptual foundations, the importance of consistent performance across diverse
inputs, and the implications of failure modes in real-world applications. Next,
we analyze the sources of non-robustness, categorizing intrinsic model
limitations, data-driven vulnerabilities, and external adversarial factors that
compromise reliability. Following this, we review state-of-the-art mitigation
strategies, and then we discuss widely adopted benchmarks, emerging metrics,
and persistent gaps in assessing real-world reliability. Finally, we synthesize
findings from existing surveys and interdisciplinary studies to highlight
trends, unresolved issues, and pathways for future research.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在更新LLM中的知识时，容易干扰与编辑知识共享主题但关系不同的细粒度无关知识，导致知识表示空间中的纠缠问题。

Method: DiKE包含知识表示解耦模块（KRD）和解耦知识编辑模块（DKE），通过矩阵理论推导出闭式、秩一的参数更新方法，实现高效且最小侵入的编辑。

Result: 实验表明，DiKE在多个LLM上显著提升了细粒度无关知识的保留能力，同时保持了竞争力的通用编辑性能。

Conclusion: DiKE为LLM知识编辑提供了一种更精细化的解决方案，有效解决了知识表示纠缠问题。

Abstract: Knowledge Editing has emerged as a promising solution for efficiently
updating embedded knowledge in large language models (LLMs). While existing
approaches demonstrate effectiveness in integrating new knowledge and
preserving the original capabilities of LLMs, they fail to maintain
fine-grained irrelevant knowledge facts that share the same subject as edited
knowledge but differ in relation and object. This challenge arises because
subject representations inherently encode multiple attributes, causing the
target and fine-grained irrelevant knowledge to become entangled in the
representation space, and thus vulnerable to unintended alterations during
editing. To address this, we propose DiKE, a novel approach that Disentangles
Knowledge representations for LLM Editing (DiKE). DiKE consists of two key
components: a Knowledge Representation Disentanglement (KRD) module that
decomposes the subject representation into target-knowledgerelated and
-unrelated components, and a Disentanglement-based Knowledge Edit (DKE) module
that updates only the target-related component while explicitly preserving the
unrelated one. We further derive a closed-form, rank-one parameter update based
on matrix theory to enable efficient and minimally invasive edits. To
rigorously evaluate fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation, we
construct FINE-KED, a new benchmark comprising fine-grained irrelevant
knowledge at different levels of relational similarity to the edited knowledge.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that DiKE substantially
improves fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation while maintaining
competitive general editing performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs推理链中冗长功能元素增加计算需求的问题，优化推理效率。

Method: 引入PIR框架，基于困惑度评估推理步骤重要性，选择性修剪低重要性步骤。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，模型准确率提升0.9%至6.6%，token使用减少3%至41%。

Conclusion: PIR为高效部署推理能力强的LLMs提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities through test-time scaling approaches, particularly when fine-tuned
with chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from more powerful large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, these reasoning chains often contain verbose elements
that mirror human problem-solving, categorized as progressive reasoning (the
essential solution development path) and functional elements (verification
processes, alternative solution approaches, and error corrections). While
progressive reasoning is crucial, the functional elements significantly
increase computational demands during test-time inference. We introduce PIR
(Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), a principled framework that
quantitatively evaluates the importance of each reasoning step based on its
impact on answer prediction confidence. PIR systematically identifies and
selectively prunes only low-importance functional steps while preserving
progressive reasoning components, creating optimized training data that
maintains the integrity of the core solution path while reducing verbosity.
Models fine-tuned on PIR-optimized data exhibit superior test-time scaling
properties, generating more concise reasoning chains while achieving improved
accuracy (+0.9\% to +6.6\%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3\% to
-41\%) across challenging reasoning benchmarks (AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond).
Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability across different model sizes,
data sources, and token budgets, offering a practical solution for deploying
reasoning-capable LLMs in scenarios where efficient test-time scaling, response
time, and computational efficiency are valuable constraints.

Conclusion: DIET为开发高效、实用且高性能的LLMs提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning but often
over-think, generating excessively long responses that hinder efficiency. We
introduce DIET ( DIfficulty-AwarE Training), a framework that systematically
cuts these "token calories" by integrating on-the-fly problem difficulty into
the reinforcement learning (RL) process. DIET dynamically adapts token
compression strategies by modulating token penalty strength and conditioning
target lengths on estimated task difficulty, to optimize the
performance-efficiency trade-off. We also theoretically analyze the pitfalls of
naive reward weighting in group-normalized RL algorithms like GRPO, and propose
Advantage Weighting technique, which enables stable and effective
implementation of these difficulty-aware objectives. Experimental results
demonstrate that DIET significantly reduces token counts while simultaneously
improving reasoning performance. Beyond raw token reduction, we show two
crucial benefits largely overlooked by prior work: (1) DIET leads to superior
inference scaling. By maintaining high per-sample quality with fewer tokens, it
enables better scaling performance via majority voting with more samples under
fixed computational budgets, an area where other methods falter. (2) DIET
enhances the natural positive correlation between response length and problem
difficulty, ensuring verbosity is appropriately allocated, unlike many existing
compression methods that disrupt this relationship. Our analyses provide a
principled and effective framework for developing more efficient, practical,
and high-performing LLMs.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) research has grown rapidly, along with increasing
concern about their limitations such as failures in reasoning, hallucinations,
and limited multilingual capability. In this survey, we conduct a data-driven,
semi-automated review of research on limitations of LLM (LLLMs) from 2022 to
2024 using a bottom-up approach. From a corpus of 250,000 ACL and arXiv papers,
we identify 14,648 relevant papers using keyword filtering, LLM-based
classification, validated against expert labels, and topic clustering (via two
approaches, HDBSCAN+BERTopic and LlooM). We find that LLM-related research
increases over fivefold in ACL and fourfold in arXiv. Since 2022, LLLMs
research grows even faster, reaching over 30% of LLM papers by late 2024.
Reasoning remains the most studied limitation, followed by generalization,
hallucination, bias, and security. The distribution of topics in the ACL
dataset stays relatively stable over time, while arXiv shifts toward safety and
controllability (with topics like security risks, alignment, hallucinations,
knowledge editing), and multimodality between 2022 and 2024. We release a
dataset of annotated abstracts and a validated methodology, and offer a
quantitative view of trends in LLM limitations research.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) significantly enhances large language models'
(LLM) reasoning capabilities. However, the extensive reasoning traces lead to
inefficiencies and an increased time-to-first-token (TTFT). We propose a novel
training paradigm that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to guide reasoning LLMs
to interleave thinking and answering for multi-hop questions. We observe that
models inherently possess the ability to perform interleaved reasoning, which
can be further enhanced through RL. We introduce a simple yet effective
rule-based reward to incentivize correct intermediate steps, which guides the
policy model toward correct reasoning paths by leveraging intermediate signals
generated during interleaved reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted across
five diverse datasets and three RL algorithms (PPO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++)
demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional think-answer reasoning,
without requiring external tools. Specifically, our approach reduces TTFT by
over 80% on average and improves up to 19.3% in Pass@1 accuracy. Furthermore,
our method, trained solely on question answering and logical reasoning
datasets, exhibits strong generalization ability to complex reasoning datasets
such as MATH, GPQA, and MMLU. Additionally, we conduct in-depth analysis to
reveal several valuable insights into conditional reward modeling.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）常产生幻觉错误，现有不确定性量化（UQ）方法存在计算开销高或依赖监督学习的问题，RAUQ旨在填补这一空白。

Method: RAUQ通过分析注意力权重，识别特定“不确定性感知”头部的注意力下降模式，自动选择这些头部并递归聚合其权重，计算序列级不确定性分数。

Result: 在4个LLM和12个任务上的实验表明，RAUQ优于现有UQ方法，计算开销极低（<1%延迟），且无需任务标签或超参数调优。

Conclusion: RAUQ为白盒LLM提供了一种即插即用的实时幻觉检测方法，具有高效性和普适性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive fluency, but often produce
critical errors known as "hallucinations". Uncertainty quantification (UQ)
methods are a promising tool for coping with this fundamental shortcoming. Yet,
existing UQ methods face challenges such as high computational overhead or
reliance on supervised learning. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In
particular, we propose RAUQ (Recurrent Attention-based Uncertainty
Quantification), an unsupervised approach that leverages intrinsic attention
patterns in transformers to detect hallucinations efficiently. By analyzing
attention weights, we identified a peculiar pattern: drops in attention to
preceding tokens are systematically observed during incorrect generations for
certain "uncertainty-aware" heads. RAUQ automatically selects such heads,
recurrently aggregates their attention weights and token-level confidences, and
computes sequence-level uncertainty scores in a single forward pass.
Experiments across 4 LLMs and 12 question answering, summarization, and
translation tasks demonstrate that RAUQ yields excellent results, outperforming
state-of-the-art UQ methods using minimal computational overhead (<1% latency).
Moreover, it requires no task-specific labels and no careful hyperparameter
tuning, offering plug-and-play real-time hallucination detection in white-box
LLMs.

Abstract: To reveal when a large language model (LLM) is uncertain about a response,
uncertainty quantification commonly produces percentage numbers along with the
output. But is this all we can do? We argue that in the output space of LLMs,
the space of strings, exist strings expressive enough to summarize the
distribution over output strings the LLM deems possible. We lay a foundation
for this new avenue of uncertainty explication and present SelfReflect, a
theoretically-motivated metric to assess how faithfully a string summarizes an
LLM's internal answer distribution. We show that SelfReflect is able to
discriminate even subtle differences of candidate summary strings and that it
aligns with human judgement, outperforming alternative metrics such as LLM
judges and embedding comparisons. With SelfReflect, we investigate a number of
self-summarization methods and find that even state-of-the-art reasoning models
struggle to explicate their internal uncertainty. But we find that faithful
summarizations can be generated by sampling and summarizing. Our metric enables
future works towards this universal form of LLM uncertainties.

Abstract: The recent rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has significantly improved
multi-step reasoning performance, but often at the cost of generating
excessively long reasoning chains. This paper revisits the efficiency of such
reasoning processes through an information-theoretic lens, revealing a
fundamental trade-off between reasoning length and semantic efficiency. We
propose two metrics, InfoBias and InfoGain, to quantify divergence from ideal
reasoning paths and stepwise information contribution, respectively. Empirical
analyses show that longer reasoning chains tend to exhibit higher information
bias and diminishing information gain, especially for incorrect answers.
Motivated by these findings, we introduce an entropy-based Adaptive Think
strategy that dynamically halts reasoning once confidence is sufficiently high,
improving efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. Compared to the
Vanilla Think approach (default mode), our strategy yields a 1.10% improvement
in average accuracy and a 50.80% reduction in token usage on QwQ-32B across six
benchmark tasks spanning diverse reasoning types and difficulty levels,
demonstrating superior efficiency and reasoning performance. These results
underscore the promise of entropy-based methods for enhancing both accuracy and

Motivation: 解决大型Transformer语言模型生成过程不透明的问题，提供一种解释和控制模型生成行为的方法。

Method: 提出MSPGT框架，使用注意力跨度阈值和层间互信息峰值确定尺度边界，并在GPT-2、BERT、RoBERTa和T5上进行验证。

Abstract: Large Transformer based language models achieve remarkable performance but
remain opaque in how they plan, structure, and realize text. We introduce
Multi_Scale Probabilistic Generation Theory (MSPGT), a hierarchical framework
that factorizes generation into three semantic scales_global context,
intermediate structure, and local word choices and aligns each scale with
specific layer ranges in Transformer architectures. To identify scale
boundaries, we propose two complementary metrics: attention span thresholds and
inter layer mutual information peaks. Across four representative models (GPT-2,
BERT, RoBERTa, and T5), these metrics yield stable local/intermediate/global
partitions, corroborated by probing tasks and causal interventions. We find
that decoder_only models allocate more layers to intermediate and global
processing while encoder_only models emphasize local feature extraction.
Through targeted interventions, we demonstrate that local scale manipulations
primarily influence lexical diversity, intermediate-scale modifications affect
sentence structure and length, and global_scale perturbations impact discourse
coherence all with statistically significant effects. MSPGT thus offers a
unified, architecture-agnostic method for interpreting, diagnosing, and
controlling large language models, bridging the gap between mechanistic
interpretability and emergent capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为‘MetaGen Blended RAG’的方法，通过混合查询索引和元数据增强来提升企业特定领域数据的检索准确性，避免了微调的高成本和低泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业特定领域数据（如医疗、法律）由于术语复杂且语义多变，导致RAG系统精度低。现有微调方法成本高且泛化性差。

Method: 构建元数据生成管道（包括关键概念、主题和缩写），创建元数据增强的混合索引，并优化搜索查询。

Result: 在PubMedQA上，检索准确率达82%，RAG准确率达77%，优于未微调的RAG和GPT3.5，接近最佳微调模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在零样本设置下表现优异，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Despite the widespread exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
its deployment in enterprises for domain-specific datasets remains limited due
to poor answer accuracy. These corpora, often shielded behind firewalls in
private enterprise knowledge bases, having complex, domain-specific
terminology, rarely seen by LLMs during pre-training; exhibit significant
semantic variability across domains (like networking, military, or legal,
etc.), or even within a single domain like medicine, and thus result in poor
context precision for RAG systems. Currently, in such situations, fine-tuning
or RAG with fine-tuning is attempted, but these approaches are slow, expensive,
and lack generalization for accuracy as the new domain-specific data emerges.
We propose an approach for Enterprise Search that focuses on enhancing the
retriever for a domain-specific corpus through hybrid query indexes and
metadata enrichment. This 'MetaGen Blended RAG' method constructs a metadata
generation pipeline using key concepts, topics, and acronyms, and then creates
a metadata-enriched hybrid index with boosted search queries. This approach
avoids overfitting and generalizes effectively across domains. On the PubMedQA
benchmark for the biomedical domain, the proposed method achieves 82% retrieval
accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all previous RAG accuracy results
without fine-tuning and sets a new benchmark for zero-shot results while
outperforming much larger models like GPT3.5. The results are even comparable
to the best fine-tuned models on this dataset, and we further demonstrate the
robustness and scalability of the approach by evaluating it on other Q&A
datasets like SQuAD, NQ etc.

Conclusion: TAGS无需参数更新即可超越多个微调医学LLM，展示了其高效性和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advances such as Chain-of-Thought prompting have significantly
improved large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot medical reasoning. However,
prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned
medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and
limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these
limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly
capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary
perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support
this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary
modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars
by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity,
and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final
answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA
benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and
improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several
fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates. The code will be

Result: GPT-4生成的规范文化特异性不足，且隐含刻板印象，易被恢复。

Conclusion: 解决这些问题对开发公平服务多样化用户的LLMs至关重要。

Abstract: LLMs have been demonstrated to align with the values of Western or North
American cultures. Prior work predominantly showed this effect through
leveraging surveys that directly ask (originally people and now also LLMs)
about their values. However, it is hard to believe that LLMs would consistently
apply those values in real-world scenarios. To address that, we take a
bottom-up approach, asking LLMs to reason about cultural norms in narratives
from different cultures. We find that GPT-4 tends to generate norms that, while
not necessarily incorrect, are significantly less culture-specific. In
addition, while it avoids overtly generating stereotypes, the stereotypical
representations of certain cultures are merely hidden rather than suppressed in
the model, and such stereotypes can be easily recovered. Addressing these
challenges is a crucial step towards developing LLMs that fairly serve their
diverse user base.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their practical utility is often limited by persistent issues of
hallucinations and outdated parametric knowledge. Although post-training model
editing offers a pathway for dynamic updates, existing methods frequently
suffer from overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry and
graph neural networks for precise and stable model edits. We introduce HYPE
(HYperbolic Parameter Editing), which comprises three key components: (i)
Hyperbolic Graph Construction, which uses Poincar\'e embeddings to represent
knowledge triples in hyperbolic space, preserving hierarchical relationships
and preventing unintended side effects by ensuring that edits to parent
concepts do not inadvertently affect child concepts; (ii) M\"obius-Transformed
Updates, which apply hyperbolic addition to propagate edits while maintaining
structural consistency within the hyperbolic manifold, unlike conventional
Euclidean updates that distort relational distances; and (iii) Dual
Stabilization, which combines gradient masking and periodic GNN parameter
resetting to prevent catastrophic forgetting by focusing updates on critical
parameters and preserving long-term knowledge. Experiments on CounterFact,
CounterFact+, and MQuAKE with GPT-J and GPT2-XL demonstrate that HYPE
significantly enhances edit stability, factual accuracy, and multi-hop
reasoning.

Conclusion: 模块化方法能有效提升跨语言任务表现，层交换合并是一种有前景的技术。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) still struggle across tasks outside of
high-resource languages. In this work, we investigate cross-lingual transfer to
lower-resource languages where task-specific post-training data is scarce.
Building on prior work, we first validate that the subsets of model parameters
that matter most for mathematical reasoning and multilingual capabilities are
distinctly non-overlapping. To exploit this implicit separability between task
and target language parameterization, we develop and analyze numerous modular
frameworks to improve the composition of the two during fine-tuning. These
methods generally employ freezing parameters or post hoc model merging to
assign math and language improvement to different key parts of the LLM. In the
absence of in-language math data, we demonstrate that the modular approaches
successfully improve upon baselines across three languages, four models, and
two fine-tuning paradigms (full and LoRA). Furthermore, we identify the most
consistently successful modular method to be fine-tuning separate language and
math experts and model merging via Layer-Swapping, somewhat surprisingly. We
offer possible explanations for this result via recent works on the linearity
of task vectors. We further explain this by empirically showing that reverting
less useful fine-tuning updates after training often outperforms freezing them
from the start.

Abstract: Enhancing the linguistic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
include low-resource languages is a critical research area. Current research
directions predominantly rely on synthetic data generated by translating
English corpora, which, while demonstrating promising linguistic understanding
and translation abilities, often results in models aligned with source language
culture. These models frequently fail to represent the cultural heritage and
values of local communities. This work proposes a methodology to create both
synthetic and retrieval-based pre-training data tailored to a specific
community, considering its (i) language, (ii) cultural heritage, and (iii)
cultural values. We demonstrate our methodology using Egyptian and Moroccan
dialects as testbeds, chosen for their linguistic and cultural richness and
current underrepresentation in LLMs. As a proof-of-concept, we develop
NileChat, a 3B parameter LLM adapted for Egyptian and Moroccan communities,
incorporating their language, cultural heritage, and values. Our results on
various understanding, translation, and cultural and values alignment
benchmarks show that NileChat outperforms existing Arabic-aware LLMs of similar
size and performs on par with larger models. We share our methods, data, and
models with the community to promote the inclusion and coverage of more diverse
communities in LLM development.

Motivation: 小型语言模型（SLM）难以直接学习长链式思维（CoT）推理，且长CoT中的冗余内容会进一步增加学习难度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效将长CoT推理能力蒸馏到SLM中，同时减少冗余推理步骤。

Conclusion: 该方法为SLM提供了高效的长CoT推理能力，同时保持了竞争力。

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 exhibit strong complex
problems solving abilities by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
steps. It is challenging to directly train small language models (SLMs) to
emerge long CoT. Thus, distillation becomes a practical method to enable SLMs
for such reasoning ability. However, the long CoT often contains a lot of
redundant contents (e.g., overthinking steps) which may make SLMs hard to learn
considering their relatively poor capacity and generalization. To address this
issue, we propose a simple-yet-effective method to prune unnecessary steps in
long CoT, and then employ an on-policy method for the SLM itself to curate
valid and useful long CoT training data. In this way, SLMs can effectively
learn efficient long CoT reasoning and preserve competitive performance at the
same time. Experimental results across a series of mathematical reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in distilling
long CoT reasoning ability into SLMs which maintains the competitive
performance but significantly reduces generating redundant reasoning steps.

Result: MedScore提取的有效事实数量是现有方法的三倍，显著提高了事实性评估的可靠性。

Conclusion: 事实性评估的准确性依赖于分解方法、验证语料库和骨干LLM的选择，需要为医学领域定制评估流程。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent and convincing
responses, they are not necessarily correct. This is especially apparent in the
popular decompose-then-verify factuality evaluation pipeline, where LLMs
evaluate generations by decomposing the generations into individual, valid
claims. Factuality evaluation is especially important for medical answers,
since incorrect medical information could seriously harm the patient. However,
existing factuality systems are a poor match for the medical domain, as they
are typically only evaluated on objective, entity-centric, formulaic texts such
as biographies and historical topics. This differs from condition-dependent,
conversational, hypothetical, sentence-structure diverse, and subjective
medical answers, which makes decomposition into valid facts challenging. We
propose MedScore, a new approach to decomposing medical answers into
condition-aware valid facts. Our method extracts up to three times more valid
facts than existing methods, reducing hallucination and vague references, and
retaining condition-dependency in facts. The resulting factuality score
significantly varies by decomposition method, verification corpus, and used
backbone LLM, highlighting the importance of customizing each step for reliable
factuality evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) often overlook intersectional and
culturally specific biases, particularly in underrepresented multilingual
regions like South Asia. This work addresses these gaps by conducting a
multilingual and intersectional analysis of LLM outputs across 10 Indo-Aryan
and Dravidian languages, identifying how cultural stigmas influenced by purdah
and patriarchy are reinforced in generative tasks. We construct a culturally
grounded bias lexicon capturing previously unexplored intersectional dimensions
including gender, religion, marital status, and number of children. We use our
lexicon to quantify intersectional bias and the effectiveness of self-debiasing
in open-ended generations (e.g., storytelling, hobbies, and to-do lists), where
bias manifests subtly and remains largely unexamined in multilingual contexts.
Finally, we evaluate two self-debiasing strategies (simple and complex prompts)
to measure their effectiveness in reducing culturally specific bias in
Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages. Our approach offers a nuanced lens into
cultural bias by introducing a novel bias lexicon and evaluation framework that
extends beyond Eurocentric or small-scale multilingual settings.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emerging capabilities
in social intelligence tasks, including implicature resolution (Sravanthi et
al. (2024)) and theory-of-mind reasoning (Shapira et al. (2024)), both of which
require substantial pragmatic understanding. However, how LLMs acquire this
competence throughout the training process remains poorly understood. In this
work, we introduce ALTPRAG, a dataset grounded in the pragmatic concept of
alternatives, designed to evaluate whether LLMs at different training stages
can accurately infer nuanced speaker intentions. Each instance pairs two
contextually appropriate but pragmatically distinct continuations, enabling
fine-grained assessment of both pragmatic interpretation and contrastive
reasoning. We systematically evaluate 22 LLMs across key training stages:
pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference optimization, to
examine the development of pragmatic competence. Our results show that even
base models exhibit notable sensitivity to pragmatic cues, which improves
consistently with increases in model and data scale. Additionally, SFT and RLHF
contribute further gains, particularly in cognitive-pragmatic reasoning. These
findings highlight pragmatic competence as an emergent and compositional
property of LLM training and offer new insights for aligning models with human
communicative norms.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models represented by the Transformer have been proven
to possess strong base capabilities, and the representative self-attention
mechanism in the Transformer has become a classic in sequence modeling
architectures. Different from the work of proposing sequence modeling
architecture to improve the efficiency of attention mechanism, this work
focuses on the impact of sequence modeling architectures on base capabilities.
Specifically, our concern is: How exactly do sequence modeling architectures
affect the base capabilities of pre-trained language models? In this work, we
first point out that the mixed domain pre-training setting commonly adopted in
existing architecture design works fails to adequately reveal the differences
in base capabilities among various architectures. To address this, we propose a
limited domain pre-training setting with out-of-distribution testing, which
successfully uncovers significant differences in base capabilities among
architectures at an early stage. Next, we analyze the base capabilities of
stateful sequence modeling architectures, and find that they exhibit
significant degradation in base capabilities compared to the Transformer. Then,
through a series of architecture component analysis, we summarize a key
architecture design principle: A sequence modeling architecture need possess
full-sequence arbitrary selection capability to avoid degradation in base
capabilities. Finally, we empirically validate this principle using an
extremely simple Top-1 element selection architecture and further generalize it
to a more practical Top-1 chunk selection architecture. Experimental results
demonstrate our proposed sequence modeling architecture design principle and
suggest that our work can serve as a valuable reference for future architecture
improvements and novel designs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in learning algorithms,
evaluations, and optimization tasks. Recent studies have shown that using
LLM-based optimizers to automatically optimize model prompts, demonstrations,
predictions themselves, or other components can significantly enhance the
performance of AI systems, as demonstrated by frameworks such as DSPy and
TextGrad. However, optimizers built on language models themselves are usually
designed by humans with manual design choices; optimizers themselves are not
optimized. Moreover, these optimizers are general purpose by design, to be
useful to a broad audience, and are not tailored for specific tasks. To address
these challenges, we propose metaTextGrad, which focuses on designing a
meta-optimizer to further enhance existing optimizers and align them to be good
optimizers for a given task. Our approach consists of two key components: a
meta prompt optimizer and a meta structure optimizer. The combination of these
two significantly improves performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving an
average absolute performance improvement of up to 6% compared to the best
baseline.

Abstract: Standing in 2025, at a critical juncture in the pursuit of Artificial General

significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capability of large language

enhance the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has attracted widespread attention from the community. In this position paper,
we argue that reinforcement fine-tuning powers the reasoning capability of
multimodal large language models. To begin with, we provide a detailed
introduction to the fundamental background knowledge that researchers
interested in this field should be familiar with. Furthermore, we meticulously
summarize the improvements of RFT in powering reasoning capability of MLLMs
into five key points: diverse modalities, diverse tasks and domains, better
training algorithms, abundant benchmarks and thriving engineering frameworks.
Finally, we propose five promising directions for future research that the

valuable insights to the community at this pivotal stage in the advancement
toward AGI. Summary of works done on RFT for MLLMs is available at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
reasoning, positioning them as promising tools for supporting human
problem-solving. However, what happens when their performance is affected by
misinformation, i.e., incorrect inputs introduced by users due to oversights or
gaps in knowledge? Such misinformation is prevalent in real-world interactions
with LLMs, yet how it propagates within LLMs' reasoning process remains
underexplored. Focusing on mathematical reasoning, we present a comprehensive
analysis of how misinformation affects intermediate reasoning steps and final
answers. We also examine how effectively LLMs can correct misinformation when
explicitly instructed to do so. Even with explicit instructions, LLMs succeed
less than half the time in rectifying misinformation, despite possessing
correct internal knowledge, leading to significant accuracy drops (10.02% -
72.20%). Further analysis shows that applying factual corrections early in the
reasoning process most effectively reduces misinformation propagation, and
fine-tuning on synthesized data with early-stage corrections significantly
improves reasoning factuality. Our work offers a practical approach to
mitigating misinformation propagation.

Motivation: 研究意图检测在LLMs安全防护中的应用，并探索其防护机制在恶意操纵下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出IntentPrompt框架，通过两阶段提示优化（结构化大纲和声明式叙述）和反馈循环迭代增强攻击效果。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在多个基准测试和黑盒LLMs上优于现有越狱方法，攻击成功率达86.75%至97.12%。

Conclusion: 意图操纵对LLMs的安全机制构成显著威胁，需进一步研究防护措施。

Abstract: Intent detection, a core component of natural language understanding, has
considerably evolved as a crucial mechanism in safeguarding large language
models (LLMs). While prior work has applied intent detection to enhance LLMs'
moderation guardrails, showing a significant success against content-level
jailbreaks, the robustness of these intent-aware guardrails under malicious
manipulations remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate the
vulnerability of intent-aware guardrails and demonstrate that LLMs exhibit
implicit intent detection capabilities. We propose a two-stage intent-based
prompt-refinement framework, IntentPrompt, that first transforms harmful
inquiries into structured outlines and further reframes them into
declarative-style narratives by iteratively optimizing prompts via feedback
loops to enhance jailbreak success for red-teaming purposes. Extensive
experiments across four public benchmarks and various black-box LLMs indicate
that our framework consistently outperforms several cutting-edge jailbreak
methods and evades even advanced Intent Analysis (IA) and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-based defenses. Specifically, our "FSTR+SPIN" variant achieves attack
success rates ranging from 88.25% to 96.54% against CoT-based defenses on the
o1 model, and from 86.75% to 97.12% on the GPT-4o model under IA-based
defenses. These findings highlight a critical weakness in LLMs' safety
mechanisms and suggest that intent manipulation poses a growing challenge to
content moderation guardrails.

Abstract: High-quality instruction data is crucial for developing large language models

operating in tag space provides superior controllability and stability across

Conclusion: 该研究为增强LLM的文化意识提供了新方法，推动了更具包容性的语言技术发展。

Abstract: The human-centered word association test (WAT) serves as a cognitive proxy,
revealing sociocultural variations through lexical-semantic patterns. We extend
this test into an LLM-adaptive, free-relation task to assess the alignment of
large language models (LLMs) with cross-cultural cognition. To mitigate the
culture preference, we propose CultureSteer, an innovative approach that
integrates a culture-aware steering mechanism to guide semantic representations
toward culturally specific spaces. Experiments show that current LLMs exhibit
significant bias toward Western cultural (notably in American) schemas at the
word association level. In contrast, our model substantially improves
cross-cultural alignment, surpassing prompt-based methods in capturing diverse
semantic associations. Further validation on culture-sensitive downstream tasks
confirms its efficacy in fostering cognitive alignment across cultures. This
work contributes a novel methodological paradigm for enhancing cultural
awareness in LLMs, advancing the development of more inclusive language

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating

Debate-Augmented RAG (DRAG), a training-free framework that integrates

In retrieval, DRAG employs structured debates among proponents, opponents, and
judges to refine retrieval quality and ensure factual reliability. In
generation, DRAG introduces asymmetric information roles and adversarial
debates, enhancing reasoning robustness and mitigating factual inconsistencies.
Evaluations across multiple tasks demonstrate that DRAG improves retrieval
reliability, reduces RAG-induced hallucinations, and significantly enhances
overall factual accuracy. Our code is available at

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in digital platforms reveals the
limitations of traditional detection methods, which mostly rely on static
classification and fail to capture the intricate process of real-world
fact-checking. Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that
enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection

Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection

assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage
debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing

introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim
across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning
Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two fakenews datasets
demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study

Abstract: Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models
with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations.
While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e.,
LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual
annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data
and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we
propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages
minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple
modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured
textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making
patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with
images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being
trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively
trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in
modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce,
underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework
highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective
alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially
advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong generalization and reasoning
abilities, making them well-suited for complex decision-making tasks such as
medical consultation (MC). However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to
capture the dual nature of MC, which entails two distinct sub-tasks: symptom

\textbf{DDO}, a novel LLM-based framework that performs
\textbf{D}ual-\textbf{D}ecision \textbf{O}ptimization by decoupling and
independently optimizing the the two sub-tasks through a collaborative
multi-agent workflow. Experiments on three real-world MC datasets show that DDO
consistently outperforms existing LLM-based approaches and achieves competitive

Motivation: 现有方法训练SLM一次性学习长理性，导致核心推理令牌梯度平滑和推理速度慢。

Conclusion: CWT和STT显著提升了SLM的推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation allows a large language model (LLM) to
guide a small language model (SLM) in reasoning tasks. Existing methods train
the SLM to learn the long rationale in one iteration, resulting in two issues:
1) Long rationales lead to a large token-level batch size during training,
making gradients of core reasoning tokens (i.e., the token will directly affect
the correctness of subsequent reasoning) over-smoothed as they contribute a
tiny fraction of the rationale. As a result, the SLM converges to sharp minima
where it fails to grasp the reasoning logic. 2) The response is slow, as the
SLM must generate a long rationale before reaching the answer. Therefore, we
propose chunk-wise training (CWT), which uses a heuristic search to divide the
rationale into internal semantically coherent chunks and focuses SLM on
learning from only one chunk per iteration. In this way, CWT naturally isolates
non-reasoning chunks that do not involve the core reasoning token (e.g.,
summary and transitional chunks) from the SLM learning for reasoning chunks,
making the fraction of the core reasoning token increase in the corresponding
iteration. Based on CWT, skip-thinking training (STT) is proposed. STT makes
the SLM automatically skip non-reasoning medium chunks to reach the answer,
improving reasoning speed while maintaining accuracy. We validate our approach
on a variety of SLMs and multiple reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to update the embedded knowledge within Large Language

from other tasks. Our evaluation covers both instruction-tuned and
reasoning-oriented LLMs, under a realistic autoregressive inference setting
rather than teacher-forced decoding. Beyond single-edit assessments, we also
evaluate multi-edit scenarios to better reflect practical demands. We employ
four evaluation dimensions, including portability, and compare all recent
methods against a simple and straightforward baseline named Selective
Contextual Reasoning (SCR). Empirical results reveal that parameter-based
editing methods perform poorly under realistic conditions. In contrast, SCR
consistently outperforms them across all settings. This study offers new

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising framework for
aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences by directly
optimizing the log-likelihood difference between chosen and rejected responses.
However, existing methods assign equal importance to all tokens in the
response, while humans focus on more meaningful parts. This leads to suboptimal
preference optimization, as irrelevant or noisy tokens disproportionately
influence DPO loss. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{O}ptimal
\textbf{T}ransport-based token weighting scheme for enhancing direct
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (OTPO). By emphasizing semantically
meaningful token pairs and de-emphasizing less relevant ones, our method
introduces a context-aware token weighting scheme that yields a more
contrastive reward difference estimate. This adaptive weighting enhances reward
stability, improves interpretability, and ensures that preference optimization
focuses on meaningful differences between responses. Extensive experiments have
validated OTPO's effectiveness in improving instruction-following ability

Conclusion: 提出了一个统一框架，连接了注意力头和任务向量，解释了ICL的底层机制。

Abstract: The unusual properties of in-context learning (ICL) have prompted
investigations into the internal mechanisms of large language models. Prior
work typically focuses on either special attention heads or task vectors at
specific layers, but lacks a unified framework linking these components to the
evolution of hidden states across layers that ultimately produce the model's
output. In this paper, we propose such a framework for ICL in classification
tasks by analyzing two geometric factors that govern performance: the
separability and alignment of query hidden states. A fine-grained analysis of
layer-wise dynamics reveals a striking two-stage mechanism: separability
emerges in early layers, while alignment develops in later layers. Ablation
studies further show that Previous Token Heads drive separability, while
Induction Heads and task vectors enhance alignment. Our findings thus bridge
the gap between attention heads and task vectors, offering a unified account of
ICL's underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: Aligning general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks
often incurs significant costs, including constructing task-specific
instruction pairs and extensive training adjustments. Prior research has
explored various avenues to enhance alignment efficiency, primarily through
minimal-data training or data-driven activations to identify key attention
heads. However, these approaches inherently introduce data dependency, which
hinders generalization and reusability. To address this issue and enhance model
alignment efficiency, we propose the \textit{\textbf{A}ttention
\textbf{L}ocalization and \textbf{P}runing \textbf{S}trategy (\textbf{ALPS})},
an efficient algorithm that localizes the most task-sensitive attention heads
and prunes by restricting attention training updates to these heads, thereby
reducing alignment costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
activates only \textbf{10\%} of attention parameters during fine-tuning while
achieving a \textbf{2\%} performance improvement over baselines on three tasks.
Moreover, the identified task-specific heads are transferable across datasets

Abstract: Human social interactions depend on the ability to infer others' unspoken
intentions, emotions, and beliefs-a cognitive skill grounded in the
psychological concept of Theory of Mind (ToM). While large language models
(LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity
and contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories
of metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind
decomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a
Theory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses user mental states (e.g., intent,
emotion), (2) a Domain Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural norms and
ethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually
appropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging
benchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain
in ToM reasoning. Notably, it enables LLMs to match human-level performance on
key ToM tasks for the first time. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of all
components, which showcase the framework's ability to balance contextual
plausibility, social appropriateness, and user adaptation. This work advances
AI systems toward human-like social intelligence, with applications in

Motivation: 探索指令调优LLMs中结构化模板对输出多样性的影响，揭示其潜在问题。

Method: 系统评估不同结构化提示对模型输出的影响，包括任务性能、对齐行为和输出多样性。

Result: 结构标记显著限制输出多样性，而格式一致性对结构敏感任务至关重要。

Conclusion: 当前提示设计可能抑制多样性，需改进为多样性感知设计。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) employ structured templates,
such as role markers and special tokens, to enforce format consistency during
inference. However, we identify a critical limitation of such formatting: it
induces a phenomenon we term diversity collapse, where the model generates
semantically similar outputs for open-ended inputs, undermining creativity and
variability. We systematically evaluate this effect across tasks like story
completion and free-form generation, finding that (1) diversity collapse
persists even under high-temperature sampling, and (2) structural tokens in
templates significantly constrain the model's output space. To contextualize
these findings, we fine-tune the same model using a range of structured prompts
and then evaluate them across three axes: downstream task performance,
alignment behavior, and output diversity. Our analysis shows that format
consistency between fine-tuning and inference is crucial for
structure-sensitive tasks (e.g., GSM8K, IFEval), but has marginal influence on
knowledge-heavy tasks (e.g., MMLU, WebQuestions). In contrast, output diversity
is primarily governed by the presence or absence of structural tokens, with
minimal formatting yielding the most diverse outputs. These findings reveal
that current prompting conventions, while beneficial for alignment, may
inadvertently suppress output diversity, underscoring the need for
diversity-aware prompt design and instruction tuning.

TL;DR: System-1.5 Reasoning框架通过动态分配计算资源优化LLM推理效率，结合深度和步骤捷径，显著提升推理速度并减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CoT推理效率低，而现有潜在空间方法未能区分关键步骤，导致资源浪费。System-1.5旨在动态优化推理过程。

Method: 提出深度捷径（DS）和步骤捷径（SS），通过两阶段自蒸馏训练实现自适应推理。

Result: 在GSM8K任务上，推理速度提升20倍，生成token减少92.31%，性能接近传统CoT方法。

Conclusion: System-1.5在保持性能的同时显著提升效率，为LLM推理优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to move
beyond fast System-1 responses and engage in deliberative System-2 reasoning.
However, this comes at the cost of significant inefficiency due to verbose
intermediate output. Recent latent-space reasoning methods improve efficiency
by operating on hidden states without decoding into language, yet they treat
all steps uniformly, failing to distinguish critical deductions from auxiliary
steps and resulting in suboptimal use of computational resources. In this
paper, we propose System-1.5 Reasoning, an adaptive reasoning framework that
dynamically allocates computation across reasoning steps through shortcut paths
in latent space.Specifically, System-1.5 Reasoning introduces two types of
dynamic shortcuts. The model depth shortcut (DS) adaptively reasons along the
vertical depth by early exiting non-critical tokens through lightweight adapter
branches, while allowing critical tokens to continue through deeper Transformer
layers. The step shortcut (SS) reuses hidden states across the decoding steps
to skip trivial steps and reason horizontally in latent space. Training
System-1.5 Reasoning involves a two-stage self-distillation process: first
distilling natural language CoT into latent-space continuous thought, and then
distilling full-path System-2 latent reasoning into adaptive shortcut paths
(System-1.5 Reasoning).Experiments on reasoning tasks demonstrate the superior
performance of our method. For example, on GSM8K, System-1.5 Reasoning achieves
reasoning performance comparable to traditional CoT fine-tuning methods while
accelerating inference by over 20x and reducing token generation by 92.31% on
average.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
natural language tasks, but their decision-making processes remain largely
opaque. Existing explanation methods either suffer from limited faithfulness to
the model's reasoning or produce explanations that humans find difficult to
understand. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ProtoSurE}, a novel
prototype-based surrogate framework that provides faithful and
human-understandable explanations for LLMs. ProtoSurE trains an
interpretable-by-design surrogate model that aligns with the target LLM while
utilizing sentence-level prototypes as human-understandable concepts. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoSurE consistently outperforms SOTA explanation
methods across diverse LLMs and datasets. Importantly, ProtoSurE demonstrates
strong data efficiency, requiring relatively few training examples to achieve
good performance, making it practical for real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有的状态空间模型在长序列建模中表现优异，但在语言表示（尤其是复杂分层推理任务）方面的能力尚未充分探索。大多数大型语言模型依赖平坦的欧几里得嵌入，限制了其对潜在层次结构的捕捉能力。

Method: HiM模型将高效的Mamba2与双曲几何（通过Poincare球或Lorentz流形映射）结合，使用可学习的曲率和双曲损失优化，以捕捉不同层次的关系距离。

Result: 实验表明，HiM模型在四个语言和医学数据集上的混合跳预测和多跳推理任务中表现优于欧几里得基线，HiM-Poincare能捕捉更细粒度的语义差异，而HiM-Lorentz提供更稳定和紧凑的嵌入。

Conclusion: HiM模型通过结合Mamba2和双曲几何，显著提升了分层推理任务的表现，为语言模型的层次感知表示提供了新思路。

Abstract: Selective state-space models have achieved great success in long-sequence
modeling. However, their capacity for language representation, especially in
complex hierarchical reasoning tasks, remains underexplored. Most large
language models rely on flat Euclidean embeddings, limiting their ability to
capture latent hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Mamba (HiM), integrating efficient Mamba2 with exponential growth and curved
nature of hyperbolic geometry to learn hierarchy-aware language embeddings for
deeper linguistic understanding. Mamba2-processed sequences are projected to
the Poincare ball (via tangent-based mapping) or Lorentzian manifold (via
cosine and sine-based mapping) with "learnable" curvature, optimized with a
combined hyperbolic loss. Our HiM model facilitates the capture of relational
distances across varying hierarchical levels, enabling effective long-range
reasoning. This makes it well-suited for tasks like mixed-hop prediction and
multi-hop inference in hierarchical classification. We evaluated our HiM with
four linguistic and medical datasets for mixed-hop prediction and multi-hop
inference tasks. Experimental results demonstrated that: 1) Both HiM models
effectively capture hierarchical relationships for four ontological datasets,
surpassing Euclidean baselines. 2) HiM-Poincare captures fine-grained semantic
distinctions with higher h-norms, while HiM-Lorentz provides more stable,
compact, and hierarchy-preserving embeddings favoring robustness over detail.

Conclusion: VerIPO通过验证器引导的迭代优化，显著提升视频LLM的长链推理能力和稳定性。

Abstract: Applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) shows significant promise for complex video reasoning. However,
popular Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) methods, such as outcome-based Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are limited by data preparation
bottlenecks (e.g., noise or high cost) and exhibit unstable improvements in the
quality of long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) and downstream performance.To address
these limitations, we propose VerIPO, a Verifier-guided Iterative Policy
Optimization method designed to gradually improve video LLMs' capacity for
generating deep, long-term reasoning chains. The core component is
Rollout-Aware Verifier, positioned between the GRPO and Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) training phases to form the GRPO-Verifier-DPO training loop.
This verifier leverages small LLMs as a judge to assess the reasoning logic of
rollouts, enabling the construction of high-quality contrastive data, including
reflective and contextually consistent CoTs. These curated preference samples
drive the efficient DPO stage (7x faster than GRPO), leading to marked
improvements in reasoning chain quality, especially in terms of length and
contextual consistency. This training loop benefits from GRPO's expansive
search and DPO's targeted optimization. Experimental results demonstrate: 1)
Significantly faster and more effective optimization compared to standard GRPO
variants, yielding superior performance; 2) Our trained models exceed the
direct inference of large-scale instruction-tuned Video-LLMs, producing long
and contextually consistent CoTs on diverse video reasoning tasks; and 3) Our
model with one iteration outperforms powerful LMMs (e.g., Kimi-VL) and long

Abstract: Effective data selection is critical for efficient training of modern Large
Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces Influence Distillation, a novel,
mathematically-justified framework for data selection that employs second-order
information to optimally weight training samples. By distilling each sample's
influence on a target distribution, our method assigns model-specific weights
that are used to select training data for LLM fine-tuning, guiding it toward
strong performance on the target domain. We derive these optimal weights for
both Gradient Descent and Adam optimizers. To ensure scalability and reduce
computational cost, we propose a $\textit{landmark-based approximation}$:
influence is precisely computed for a small subset of "landmark" samples and
then efficiently propagated to all other samples to determine their weights. We
validate Influence Distillation by applying it to instruction tuning on the
Tulu V2 dataset, targeting a range of tasks including GSM8k, SQuAD, and MMLU,
across several models from the Llama and Qwen families. Experiments show that
Influence Distillation matches or outperforms state-of-the-art performance
while achieving up to $3.5\times$ faster selection.

Conclusion: 扩展拒绝微调能有效抵御ablation攻击，且不影响模型的其他功能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to comply with safety
guidelines by refusing harmful instructions. A recent attack, termed
abliteration, isolates and suppresses the single latent direction most
responsible for refusal behavior, enabling the model to generate unethical
content. We propose a defense that modifies how models generate refusals. We
construct an extended-refusal dataset that contains harmful prompts with a full
response that justifies the reason for refusal. We then fine-tune
Llama-2-7B-Chat and Qwen2.5-Instruct (1.5B and 3B parameters) on our
extended-refusal dataset, and evaluate the resulting systems on a set of
harmful prompts. In our experiments, extended-refusal models maintain high
refusal rates, dropping at most by 10%, whereas baseline models' refusal rates
drop by 70-80% after abliteration. A broad evaluation of safety and utility
shows that extended-refusal fine-tuning neutralizes the abliteration attack
while preserving general performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools across various
applications, making it more important than ever to ensure the quality and the
trustworthiness of their outputs. This has led to growing interest in
uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for assessing the reliability of LLM
outputs. Many existing UQ techniques rely on token probabilities, which
inadvertently introduces a bias with respect to the length of the output. While
some methods attempt to account for this, we demonstrate that such biases
persist even in length-normalized approaches. To address the problem, here we
propose UNCERTAINTY-LINE: (Length-INvariant Estimation), a simple debiasing
procedure that regresses uncertainty scores on output length and uses the
residuals as corrected, length-invariant estimates. Our method is post-hoc,
model-agnostic, and applicable to a range of UQ measures. Through extensive
evaluation on machine translation, summarization, and question-answering tasks,
we demonstrate that UNCERTAINTY-LINE: consistently improves over even nominally
length-normalized UQ methods uncertainty estimates across multiple metrics and

diverse models and tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, which achieves

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained significant attention for its
simplicity and computational efficiency in aligning large language models
(LLMs). Recent advancements have extended DPO to multimodal scenarios,
achieving strong performance. However, traditional DPO relies on binary
preference optimization, rewarding or penalizing entire responses without
considering fine-grained segment correctness, leading to suboptimal solutions.
The root of this issue lies in the absence of fine-grained supervision during
the optimization process. To address this, we propose Adaptive Sentence-level
Preference Optimization (ASPO), which evaluates individual sentences for more
precise preference optimization. By dynamically calculating adaptive rewards at
the sentence level based on model predictions, ASPO enhances response content
assessment without additional models or parameters. This significantly improves
the alignment of multimodal features. Extensive experiments show that ASPO
substantially enhances the overall performance of multimodal models.

Abstract: Investigating hallucination issues in large language models (LLMs) within

Cross-lingual and Cross-modal Hallucinations benchmark (CCHall) to fill this
gap. Specifically, CCHall simultaneously incorporates both cross-lingual and
cross-modal hallucination scenarios, which can be used to assess the
cross-lingual and cross-modal capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation on CCHall, exploring both mainstream open-source and

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning

Additionally, the model is able to self-evaluate its intermediate reasoning
steps. During iterative reasoning, the model engages in branching exploration

Method: 通过观察预训练阶段的损失轨迹，发现模型难以区分单语和语言混淆文本。采用ORPO方法，在标准监督微调基础上增加对不期望输出风格的惩罚。

Result: ORPO能有效抑制语言混淆生成，即使在高解码温度下也不影响模型整体性能。

Conclusion: 引入适当的惩罚项可以在低资源环境中缓解语言混淆问题。

Abstract: Large language models often suffer from language confusion, a phenomenon
where responses are partially or entirely generated in unintended languages.
This can critically impact user experience in low-resource settings. We
hypothesize that conventional supervised fine-tuning exacerbates this issue
because the softmax objective focuses probability mass only on the single
correct token but does not explicitly penalize cross-lingual mixing.
Interestingly, by observing loss trajectories during the pretraining phase, we
observe that models fail to learn to distinguish between monolingual and
language-confused text. Additionally, we find that ORPO, which adds penalties
for unwanted output styles to standard SFT, effectively suppresses
language-confused generations even at high decoding temperatures without
degrading overall model performance. Our findings suggest that incorporating
appropriate penalty terms can mitigate language confusion in low-resource
settings with limited data.

Abstract: Despite the recent strides in large language models, studies have underscored
the existence of social biases within these systems. In this paper, we delve
into the validation and comparison of the ethical biases of LLMs concerning
globally discussed and potentially sensitive topics, hypothesizing that these
biases may arise from language-specific distinctions. Introducing the
Multilingual Sensitive Questions & Answers Dataset (MSQAD), we collected news
articles from Human Rights Watch covering 17 topics, and generated socially
sensitive questions along with corresponding responses in multiple languages.
We scrutinized the biases of these responses across languages and topics,
employing two statistical hypothesis tests. The results showed that the null
hypotheses were rejected in most cases, indicating biases arising from
cross-language differences. It demonstrates that ethical biases in responses
are widespread across various languages, and notably, these biases were
prevalent even among different LLMs. By making the proposed MSQAD openly
available, we aim to facilitate future research endeavors focused on examining
cross-language biases in LLMs and their variant models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs
(MLLMs) has historically relied on model-centric scaling through increasing
parameter counts from millions to hundreds of billions to drive performance
gains. However, as we approach hardware limits on model size, the dominant
computational bottleneck has fundamentally shifted to the quadratic cost of
self-attention over long token sequences, now driven by ultra-long text
contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper,
\textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient AI is shifting from
model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position token
compression as the new frontier, which improves AI efficiency via reducing the
number of tokens during model training or inference. Through comprehensive
analysis, we first examine recent developments in long-context AI across
various domains and establish a unified mathematical framework for existing
model efficiency strategies, demonstrating why token compression represents a
crucial paradigm shift in addressing long-context overhead. Subsequently, we
systematically review the research landscape of token compression, analyzing
its fundamental benefits and identifying its compelling advantages across
diverse scenarios. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of current
challenges in token compression research and outline promising future

Motivation: LLM作为评估工具（如GPT-4）因其成本效益和与人类评估的一致性而流行，但训练代理评估模型时存在教师偏好偏差问题。

Method: 提出三阶段框架AGDe-Judge，通过引入无偏辅助模型，从标签和反馈两方面去偏。

Result: 实验表明，AGDe-Judge能有效减少教师偏好偏差，同时在六个评测基准上保持高性能。

Conclusion: AGDe-Judge为解决LLM评估中的教师偏好偏差提供了有效方案。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge employs large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to
evaluate the quality of LLM-generated responses, gaining popularity for its
cost-effectiveness and strong alignment with human evaluations. However,
training proxy judge models using evaluation data generated by powerful teacher
models introduces a critical yet previously overlooked issue: teacher
preference bias, where the proxy judge model learns a biased preference for
responses from the teacher model. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
setting that incorporates an additional assistant model, which is not biased
toward the teacher model's responses, to complement the training data. Building
on this setup, we introduce AGDe-Judge, a three-stage framework designed to
debias from both the labels and feedbacks in the training data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AGDe-Judge effectively reduces teacher preference
bias while maintaining strong performance across six evaluation benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在动态对抗辩论中的置信度调整能力，发现模型普遍存在过度自信、置信度上升、相互高估等问题，表明LLMs在多轮动态任务中缺乏准确的自我评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在动态、对抗性辩论中是否能准确调整其置信度，以评估其在多轮任务中的自我评估能力。

Method: 组织了60场三回合政策辩论，涉及10种最先进的LLMs，模型在每轮后私下评估其获胜置信度（0-100）。

Result: 观察到五种问题模式：系统性过度自信、置信度上升、相互高估、自我辩论偏见和私人推理与公开评分不一致。

Conclusion: LLMs在多轮动态任务中缺乏准确的自我评估能力，对其在助理或代理角色中的部署提出了担忧。

Abstract: Can LLMs accurately adjust their confidence when facing opposition? Building
on previous studies measuring calibration on static fact-based
question-answering tasks, we evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in a
dynamic, adversarial debate setting, uniquely combining two realistic factors:
(a) a multi-turn format requiring models to update beliefs as new information
emerges, and (b) a zero-sum structure to control for task-related uncertainty,
since mutual high-confidence claims imply systematic overconfidence. We
organized 60 three-round policy debates among ten state-of-the-art LLMs, with
models privately rating their confidence (0-100) in winning after each round.
We observed five concerning patterns: (1) Systematic overconfidence: models
began debates with average initial confidence of 72.9% vs. a rational 50%
baseline. (2) Confidence escalation: rather than reducing confidence as debates
progressed, debaters increased their win probabilities, averaging 83% by the
final round. (3) Mutual overestimation: in 61.7% of debates, both sides
simultaneously claimed >=75% probability of victory, a logical impossibility.
(4) Persistent self-debate bias: models debating identical copies increased
confidence from 64.1% to 75.2%; even when explicitly informed their chance of
winning was exactly 50%, confidence still rose (from 50.0% to 57.1%). (5)
Misaligned private reasoning: models' private scratchpad thoughts sometimes
differed from their public confidence ratings, raising concerns about
faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning. These results suggest LLMs lack the
ability to accurately self-assess or update their beliefs in dynamic,
multi-turn tasks; a major concern as LLM outputs are deployed without careful
review in assistant roles or agentic settings.

Conclusion: DREAM为多模态解码提供了一种高效、准确且并行的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a powerful method for accelerating
autoregressive generation in large language models (LLMs), yet its integration
into vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. We introduce DREAM, a
novel speculative decoding framework tailored for VLMs that combines three key
innovations: (1) a cross-attention-based mechanism to inject intermediate
features from the target model into the draft model for improved alignment, (2)
adaptive intermediate feature selection based on attention entropy to guide
efficient draft model training, and (3) visual token compression to reduce
draft model latency. DREAM enables efficient, accurate, and parallel multimodal
decoding with significant throughput improvement. Experiments across a diverse
set of recent popular VLMs, including LLaVA, Pixtral, SmolVLM and Gemma3,
demonstrate up to 3.6x speedup over conventional decoding and significantly
outperform prior SD baselines in both inference throughput and speculative
draft acceptance length across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. The code

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating scientific
hypothesis generation, yet existing approaches primarily yield coarse-grained
hypotheses lacking critical methodological and experimental details. We
introduce and formally define the novel task of fine-grained scientific
hypothesis discovery, which entails generating detailed, experimentally
actionable hypotheses from coarse initial research directions. We frame this as
a combinatorial optimization problem and investigate the upper limits of LLMs'
capacity to solve it when maximally leveraged. Specifically, we explore four
foundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to
formulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most
promising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own
internal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis
space; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment
with ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an
ensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than
defining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4)
whether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape
than a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search
method that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis,
progressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations. We
show that this hierarchical process smooths the reward landscape and enables
more effective optimization. Empirical evaluations on a new benchmark of
expert-annotated fine-grained hypotheses from recent chemistry literature show
that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their use in
complex agentic roles, involving decision-making with humans or other agents,
making ethical alignment a key AI safety concern. While prior work has examined
both LLMs' moral judgment and strategic behavior in social dilemmas, there is
limited understanding of how they act when moral imperatives directly conflict
with rewards or incentives. To investigate this, we introduce Moral Behavior in
Social Dilemma Simulation (MoralSim) and evaluate how LLMs behave in the
prisoner's dilemma and public goods game with morally charged contexts. In
MoralSim, we test a range of frontier models across both game structures and
three distinct moral framings, enabling a systematic examination of how LLMs
navigate social dilemmas in which ethical norms conflict with payoff-maximizing
strategies. Our results show substantial variation across models in both their
general tendency to act morally and the consistency of their behavior across
game types, the specific moral framing, and situational factors such as
opponent behavior and survival risks. Crucially, no model exhibits consistently
moral behavior in MoralSim, highlighting the need for caution when deploying
LLMs in agentic roles where the agent's "self-interest" may conflict with
ethical expectations. Our code is available at

Abstract: Creativity evaluation remains a challenging frontier for large language
models (LLMs). Current evaluations heavily rely on inefficient and costly human
judgments, hindering progress in enhancing machine creativity. While automated
methods exist, ranging from psychological testing to heuristic- or
prompting-based approaches, they often lack generalizability or alignment with
human judgment. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel
pairwise-comparison framework for assessing textual creativity, leveraging
shared contextual instructions to improve evaluation consistency. We introduce
CreataSet, a large-scale dataset with 100K+ human-level and 1M+ synthetic
creative instruction-response pairs spanning diverse open-domain tasks. Through
training on CreataSet, we develop an LLM-based evaluator named CrEval. CrEval
demonstrates remarkable superiority over existing methods in alignment with
human judgments. Experimental results underscore the indispensable significance
of integrating both human-generated and synthetic data in training highly
robust evaluators, and showcase the practical utility of CrEval in boosting the
creativity of LLMs. We will release all data, code, and models publicly soon to

Abstract: Current large-language models (LLMs) typically adopt a fixed reasoning
strategy, either simple or complex, for all questions, regardless of their
difficulty. This neglect of variation in task and reasoning process complexity
leads to an imbalance between performance and efficiency. Existing methods
attempt to implement training-free fast-slow thinking system switching to
handle problems of varying difficulty, but are limited by coarse-grained
solution-level strategy adjustments. To address this issue, we propose a novel
reasoning paradigm: Process-Level Adaptive Thinking Mode Switching (PATS),
which enables LLMs to dynamically adjust their reasoning strategy based on the
difficulty of each step, optimizing the balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency. Our approach integrates Process Reward Models (PRMs)
with Beam Search, incorporating progressive mode switching and bad-step penalty
mechanisms. Experiments on diverse mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our
methodology achieves high accuracy while maintaining moderate token usage. This
study emphasizes the significance of process-level, difficulty-aware reasoning
strategy adaptation, offering valuable insights into efficient inference for

Abstract: Large language models have been extensively studied as neural knowledge bases
for their knowledge access, editability, reasoning, and explainability.
However, few works focus on the structural patterns of their knowledge.
Motivated by this gap, we investigate these structural patterns from a graph
perspective. We quantify the knowledge of LLMs at both the triplet and entity
levels, and analyze how it relates to graph structural properties such as node
degree. Furthermore, we uncover the knowledge homophily, where topologically
close entities exhibit similar levels of knowledgeability, which further
motivates us to develop graph machine learning models to estimate entity
knowledge based on its local neighbors. This model further enables valuable
knowledge checking by selecting triplets less known to LLMs. Empirical results
show that using selected triplets for fine-tuning leads to superior
performance.

Abstract: Long-context capability is considered one of the most important abilities of
LLMs, as a truly long context-capable LLM enables users to effortlessly process
many originally exhausting tasks -- e.g., digesting a long-form document to
find answers vs. directly asking an LLM about it. However, existing
real-task-based long-context evaluation benchmarks have two major shortcomings.
First, benchmarks like LongBench often do not provide proper metrics to
separate long-context performance from the model's baseline ability, making
cross-model comparison unclear. Second, such benchmarks are usually constructed
with fixed input lengths, which limits their applicability across different
models and fails to reveal when a model begins to break down. To address these
issues, we introduce a length-controllable long-context benchmark and a novel
metric that disentangles baseline knowledge from true long-context
capabilities. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in
effectively evaluating LLMs.

Conclusion: 推理级监控为LLM智能体系统中的知识产权保护提供了新方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents capable of
collaborative reasoning and task execution, multi-agent LLM systems have
emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex problems. However, these
systems pose new challenges for copyright protection, particularly when
sensitive or copyrighted content is inadvertently recalled through inter-agent
communication and reasoning. Existing protection techniques primarily focus on
detecting content in final outputs, overlooking the richer, more revealing
reasoning processes within the agents themselves. In this paper, we introduce
CoTGuard, a novel framework for copyright protection that leverages
trigger-based detection within Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Specifically,
we can activate specific CoT segments and monitor intermediate reasoning steps
for unauthorized content reproduction by embedding specific trigger queries
into agent prompts. This approach enables fine-grained, interpretable detection
of copyright violations in collaborative agent scenarios. We evaluate CoTGuard
on various benchmarks in extensive experiments and show that it effectively
uncovers content leakage with minimal interference to task performance. Our
findings suggest that reasoning-level monitoring offers a promising direction
for safeguarding intellectual property in LLM-based agent systems.

Conclusion: SRP通过结合LLMs和KGs的迭代反思机制，显著提升了推理的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in natural language processing tasks, yet they remain prone to
hallucinations when reasoning with insufficient internal knowledge. While
integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) provides access to structured,
verifiable information, existing approaches often generate incomplete or
factually inconsistent reasoning paths. To this end, we propose Self-Reflective
Planning (SRP), a framework that synergizes LLMs with KGs through iterative,
reference-guided reasoning. Specifically, given a question and topic entities,
SRP first searches for references to guide planning and reflection. In the
planning process, it checks initial relations and generates a reasoning path.
After retrieving knowledge from KGs through a reasoning path, it implements
iterative reflection by judging the retrieval result and editing the reasoning
path until the answer is correctly retrieved. Extensive experiments on three
public datasets demonstrate that SRP surpasses various strong baselines and
further underscore its reliable reasoning ability.

Abstract: AI support of collaborative interactions entails mediating potential
misalignment between interlocutor beliefs. Common preference alignment methods
like DPO excel in static settings, but struggle in dynamic collaborative tasks
where the explicit signals of interlocutor beliefs are sparse and skewed. We
propose the Frictional Agent Alignment Framework (FAAF), to generate precise,
context-aware "friction" that prompts for deliberation and re-examination of
existing evidence. FAAF's two-player objective decouples from data skew: a
frictive-state policy identifies belief misalignments, while an intervention
policy crafts collaborator-preferred responses. We derive an analytical
solution to this objective, enabling training a single policy via a simple
supervised loss. Experiments on three benchmarks show FAAF outperforms
competitors in producing concise, interpretable friction and in OOD
generalization. By aligning LLMs to act as adaptive "thought partners" -- not
passive responders -- FAAF advances scalable, dynamic human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: The inherent capabilities of a language model (LM) and the reasoning
strategies it employs jointly determine its performance in reasoning tasks.
While test-time scaling is regarded as an effective approach to tackling
complex reasoning tasks, it incurs substantial computational costs and often
leads to "overthinking", where models become trapped in "thought pitfalls". To
address this challenge, we propose Route-To-Reason (RTR), a novel unified
routing framework that dynamically allocates both LMs and reasoning strategies
according to task difficulty under budget constraints. RTR learns compressed
representations of both expert models and reasoning strategies, enabling their
joint and adaptive selection at inference time. This method is low-cost, highly
flexible, and can be seamlessly extended to arbitrary black-box or white-box
models and strategies, achieving true plug-and-play functionality. Extensive
experiments across seven open source models and four reasoning strategies
demonstrate that RTR achieves an optimal trade-off between accuracy and
computational efficiency among all baselines, achieving higher accuracy than

length as surrogate signals to train LLMs for mathematical problem-solving,
bypassing the need for traditional ground truth answers.Our study shows that a
reward function centered on format correctness alone can yield performance
improvements comparable to the standard GRPO algorithm in early phases.
Recognizing the limitations of format-only rewards in the later phases, we
incorporate length-based rewards. The resulting GRPO approach, leveraging
format-length surrogate signals, not only matches but surpasses the performance
of the standard GRPO algorithm relying on ground truth answers in certain
scenarios, achieving 40.0\% accuracy on AIME2024 with a 7B base model. Through
systematic exploration and experimentation, this research not only offers a
practical solution for training LLMs to solve mathematical problems and
reducing the dependence on extensive ground truth data collection, but also
reveals the essence of why our label-free approach succeeds: base model is like
an excellent student who has already mastered mathematical and logical
reasoning skills, but performs poorly on the test paper, it simply needs to
develop good answering habits to achieve outstanding results in exams , in
other words, to unlock the capabilities it already possesses.

Conclusion: FlowHN通过创新的负载平衡和输出融合策略，显著提升了混合架构的性能。

Abstract: Attention and State-Space Models (SSMs) when combined in a hybrid network in
sequence or in parallel provide complementary strengths. In a hybrid sequential
pipeline they alternate between applying a transformer to the input and then
feeding its output into a SSM. This results in idle periods in the individual
components increasing end-to-end latency and lowering throughput caps. In the
parallel hybrid architecture, the transformer operates independently in
parallel with the SSM, and these pairs are cascaded, with output from one pair
forming the input to the next. Two issues are (i) creating an expressive
knowledge representation with the inherently divergent outputs from these
separate branches, and (ii) load balancing the computation between these
parallel branches, while maintaining representation fidelity. In this work we
present FlowHN, a novel parallel hybrid network architecture that accommodates
various strategies for load balancing, achieved through appropriate
distribution of input tokens between the two branches. Two innovative
differentiating factors in FlowHN include a FLOP aware dynamic token split
between the attention and SSM branches yielding efficient balance in compute
load, and secondly, a method to fuse the highly divergent outputs from
individual branches for enhancing representation expressivity. Together they
enable much better token processing speeds, avoid bottlenecks, and at the same
time yield significantly improved accuracy as compared to other competing
works. We conduct comprehensive experiments on autoregressive language modeling
for models with 135M, 350M, and 1B parameters. FlowHN outperforms sequential
hybrid models and its parallel counterpart, achieving up to 4* higher Tokens
per Second (TPS) and 2* better Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU).

Abstract: Learning to adapt pretrained language models to unlabeled,
out-of-distribution data is a critical challenge, as models often falter on
structurally novel reasoning tasks even while excelling within their training
distribution. We introduce a new framework called VDS-TTT - Verifier-Driven
Sample Selection for Test-Time Training to efficiently address this. We use a
learned verifier to score a pool of generated responses and select only from
high ranking pseudo-labeled examples for fine-tuned adaptation. Specifically,
for each input query our LLM generates N candidate answers; the verifier
assigns a reliability score to each, and the response with the highest
confidence and above a fixed threshold is paired with its query for test-time
training. We fine-tune only low-rank LoRA adapter parameters, ensuring
adaptation efficiency and fast convergence. Our proposed self-supervised
framework is the first to synthesize verifier driven test-time training data
for continuous self-improvement of the model. Experiments across three diverse
benchmarks and three state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that VDS-TTT yields up
to a 32.29% relative improvement over the base model and a 6.66% gain compared
to verifier-based methods without test-time training, highlighting its
effectiveness and efficiency for on-the-fly large language model adaptation.

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) have paved the way for their expanding applications in embodied
AI, robotics, and other real-world tasks. To effectively support these
applications, grounding in spatial and temporal understanding in multimodal
environments is essential. To this end, recent works have leveraged scene
graphs, a structured representation that encodes entities, attributes, and
their relationships in a scene. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs'
ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce
Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess
LLMs' ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual
narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models
perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph
generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that
these models fail to effectively decompose discrete scenes from a complex
narrative, leading to a bottleneck when generating scene graphs. These findings
underscore the need for improved methodologies in scene graph generation and
provide valuable insights for future research. The demonstration of our
benchmark is available at https://tsg-bench.netlify.app. Additionally, our code

Abstract: Large proprietary language models exhibit strong causal reasoning abilities
that smaller open-source models struggle to replicate. We introduce a novel
framework for distilling causal explanations that transfers causal reasoning
skills from a powerful teacher model to a compact open-source model. The key
idea is to train the smaller model to develop causal reasoning abilities by
generating structured cause-and-effect explanations consistent with those of
the teacher model. To evaluate the quality of the student-generated
explanations, we introduce a new metric called Causal Explanation Coherence
(CEC) to assess the structural and logical consistency of causal reasoning.
This metric uses sentence-level semantic alignment to measure how well each
part of the generated explanation corresponds to the teacher's reference,
capturing both faithfulness and coverage of the underlying causal chain. Our
framework and the CEC metric provide a principled foundation for training
smaller models to perform robust causal reasoning and for systematically
assessing the coherence of explanations in language model outputs.

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of large language

existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input
distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We
introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a
closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data
generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data
generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples
that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines
the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic
improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external
supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning
benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods,
highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs中语法特化的形成机制，为未来研究提供了工具和数据支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been found to develop surprising internal
specializations: Individual neurons, attention heads, and circuits become
selectively sensitive to syntactic structure, reflecting patterns observed in
the human brain. While this specialization is well-documented, how it emerges
during training and what influences its development remains largely unknown.
  In this work, we tap into the black box of specialization by tracking its
formation over time. By quantifying internal syntactic consistency across
minimal pairs from various syntactic phenomena, we identify a clear
developmental trajectory: Syntactic sensitivity emerges gradually, concentrates
in specific layers, and exhibits a 'critical period' of rapid internal
specialization. This process is consistent across architectures and
initialization parameters (e.g., random seeds), and is influenced by model
scale and training data. We therefore reveal not only where syntax arises in
LLMs but also how some models internalize it during training. To support future
research, we will release the code, models, and training checkpoints upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: MemGAS通过多粒度关联和自适应检索，显著提升了LLM在长对话中的记忆性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been widely adopted in
conversational agents. However, the increasingly long interactions between
users and agents accumulate extensive dialogue records, making it difficult for
LLMs with limited context windows to maintain a coherent long-term dialogue
memory and deliver personalized responses. While retrieval-augmented memory
systems have emerged to address this issue, existing methods often depend on
single-granularity memory segmentation and retrieval. This approach falls short
in capturing deep memory connections, leading to partial retrieval of useful
information or substantial noise, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
tackle these limits, we propose MemGAS, a framework that enhances memory
consolidation by constructing multi-granularity association, adaptive
selection, and retrieval. MemGAS is based on multi-granularity memory units and
employs Gaussian Mixture Models to cluster and associate new memories with
historical ones. An entropy-based router adaptively selects optimal granularity
by evaluating query relevance distributions and balancing information
completeness and noise. Retrieved memories are further refined via LLM-based
filtering. Experiments on four long-term memory benchmarks demonstrate that
MemGAS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both question answer and
retrieval tasks, achieving superior performance across different query types
and top-K settings.

Result: 在长上下文评估中，TailorKV在激进压缩设置下实现了近乎无损的性能，优于现有技术。例如，Llama-3.1-8B模型在128k上下文下可在单个RTX 3090 GPU上运行，解码速度为82毫秒/令牌。

Conclusion: TailorKV通过结合量化和选择性加载，有效解决了KV缓存的内存和延迟问题，为高效LLM推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache in generative large language models (LLMs)
introduces substantial memory overhead. Existing works mitigate this burden by
offloading or compressing the KV cache. However, loading the entire cache
incurs significant latency due to PCIe bandwidth bottlenecks in CPU-GPU
communication, while aggressive compression causes notable performance
degradation. We identify that certain layers in the LLM need to maintain global
information and are unsuitable for selective loading. In contrast, other layers
primarily focus on a few tokens with dominant activations that potentially
incur substantial quantization error. This observation leads to a key insight
that loading dominant tokens and quantizing all tokens can complement each
other. Building on this insight, we propose a hybrid compression method,
TailorKV, which seamlessly integrates quantization and offloading. TailorKV
develops an inference framework along with a hardware-friendly implementation
that leverages these complementary characteristics. Extensive long-context
evaluations exhibit that TailorKV achieves nearly lossless performance under
aggressive compression settings, outperforming the state-of-the-art.
Particularly, the Llama-3.1-8B with 128k context can be served within a single
RTX 3090 GPU, reaching 82 ms per token during decoding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results across diverse
downstream tasks, but their monolithic nature restricts scalability and
efficiency in complex problem-solving. While recent research explores
multi-agent collaboration among LLMs, most approaches rely on static
organizational structures that struggle to adapt as task complexity and agent
numbers grow, resulting in coordination overhead and inefficiencies. To this
end, we propose a puppeteer-style paradigm for LLM-based multi-agent
collaboration, where a centralized orchestrator ("puppeteer") dynamically
directs agents ("puppets") in response to evolving task states. This
orchestrator is trained via reinforcement learning to adaptively sequence and
prioritize agents, enabling flexible and evolvable collective reasoning.
Experiments on closed- and open-domain scenarios show that this method achieves
superior performance with reduced computational costs. Analyses further reveal
that the key improvements consistently stem from the emergence of more compact,
cyclic reasoning structures under the orchestrator's evolution.

Abstract: Typical methods for evaluating the performance of language models evaluate
their ability to answer questions accurately. These evaluation metrics are
acceptable for determining the extent to which language models can understand
and reason about text in a general sense, but fail to capture nuanced
capabilities, such as the ability of language models to recognize and obey rare
grammar points, particularly in languages other than English. We measure the
perplexity of language models when confronted with the "first person psych
predicate restriction" grammar point in Japanese. Weblab is the only tested
open source model in the 7-10B parameter range which consistently assigns
higher perplexity to ungrammatical psych predicate sentences than grammatical
ones. We give evidence that Weblab's uniformly bad tokenization is a possible
root cause for its good performance, and show that Llama 3's perplexity on
grammatical psych predicate sentences can be reduced by orders of magnitude
(28x difference) by restricting test sentences to those with uniformly
well-behaved tokenizations. We show in further experiments on machine
translation tasks that language models will use alternative grammar patterns in
order to produce grammatical sentences when tokenization issues prevent the
most natural sentence from being output.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the
field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world
clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Existing systems rely on a
one-way information transmission mode where patients must fully describe their
symptoms in a single round, leading to nonspecific diagnostic recommendations
when complaints are vague. Traditional multi-turn dialogue methods based on
supervised learning are constrained by static data-driven paradigms, lacking
generalizability and struggling to intelligently extract key clinical
information. To address these limitations, we propose DoctorAgent-RL, a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that
models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under
uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy
within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent,
dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive
rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables
LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical
reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing
dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English
multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient
interactions. Experiments demonstrate that DoctorAgent-RL outperforms existing
models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic
performance, demonstrating practical value in assisting clinical consultations.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the performance of
Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. However, existing research has
overlooked the efficiency of TTS from a latency-sensitive perspective. Through
a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods, we demonstrate that a
compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios
where latency is critical. To address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS,
we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1)
branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference
branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding.
By integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources
properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3%
accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4%
within 10 seconds. Our work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and

challenges: how to integrate knowledge into LLMs effectively and how to
adaptively generate results with specific answer formats for various task
situations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named
GenKI, which aims to improve the OpenQA performance by exploring Knowledge
Integration and controllable Generation on LLMs simultaneously. Specifically,
we first train a dense passage retrieval model to retrieve associated knowledge
from a given knowledge base. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge
integration model that incorporates the retrieval knowledge into instructions
during fine-tuning to intensify the model. Furthermore, to enable controllable
generation in LLMs, we leverage a certain fine-tuned LLM and an ensemble based
on text consistency incorporating all coherence, fluency, and answer format
assurance. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, MSMARCO,
and CMRC2018 datasets, featuring diverse answer formats, have demonstrated the
effectiveness of GenKI with comparison of state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover,
ablation studies have disclosed a linear relationship between the frequency of
retrieved knowledge and the model's ability to recall knowledge accurately
against the ground truth. Our code of GenKI is available at

Motivation: 传统标注数据集成本高，LLM生成标签虽高效但噪声问题显著，现有研究对LLM生成噪声关注不足。

Conclusion: SiDyP有效提升模型对LLM生成噪声标签的鲁棒性，适用于多种NLP任务。

Abstract: The traditional process of creating labeled datasets is labor-intensive and
expensive. Recent breakthroughs in open-source large language models (LLMs)
have opened up a new avenue in generating labeled datasets automatically for
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing an alternative to
such an expensive annotation process. However, the reliability of such
auto-generated labels remains a significant concern due to inherent
inaccuracies. When learning from noisy labels, the model's generalization is
likely to be harmed as it is prone to overfit to those label noises. While
previous studies in learning from noisy labels mainly focus on synthetic noise
and real-world noise, LLM-generated label noise receives less attention. In
this paper, we propose SiDyP: Simplex Label Diffusion with Dynamic Prior to
calibrate the classifier's prediction, thus enhancing its robustness towards
LLM-generated noisy labels. SiDyP retrieves potential true label candidates by
neighborhood label distribution in text embedding space and iteratively refines
noisy candidates using a simplex diffusion model. Our framework can increase
the performance of the BERT classifier fine-tuned on both zero-shot and
few-shot LLM-generated noisy label datasets by an average of 7.21% and 7.30%
respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiDyP by conducting extensive
benchmarking for different LLMs over a variety of NLP tasks. Our code is
available on Github.

Conclusion: RAM提供了一种高效、灵活的对齐方法，适用于多样化应用场景。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) across industries has
increased the demand for high-quality and customizable outputs. However,
traditional alignment methods often require retraining large pretrained models,
making it difficult to quickly adapt and optimize LLMs for diverse
applications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Residual
Alignment Model} (\textit{RAM}) that formalizes the alignment process as a type
of importance sampling. In this framework, the unaligned upstream model serves
as the proposal distribution, while the alignment process is framed as
secondary sampling based on an autoregressive alignment module that acts as an
estimator of the importance weights. This design enables a natural detachment
of the alignment module from the target aligned model, improving flexibility
and scalability. Based on this model, we derive an efficient sequence-level
training strategy for the alignment module, which operates independently of the
proposal module. Additionally, we develop a resampling algorithm with iterative
token-level decoding to address the common first-token latency issue in
comparable methods. Experimental evaluations on two leading open-source LLMs
across diverse tasks, including instruction following, domain adaptation, and
preference optimization, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
baseline models.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多跳和推理密集型任务（如数学问题解决）中容易产生幻觉，而现有的结果奖励模型仅验证最终答案。过程奖励模型（PRMs）通过评分中间步骤来引导生成连贯的解决方案。

Method: 提出PathFinder-PRM，一种分层、错误感知的判别性PRM，分类数学和一致性错误并组合细粒度信号估计步骤正确性。使用40万样本数据集训练，结合PRM800K和RLHFlow Mistral数据。

Result: 在PRMBench上，PathFinder-PRM以67.7的PRMScore创下新纪录，优于之前的最佳表现（65.5），且数据使用量减少3倍。在奖励引导的贪婪搜索中，prm@8达到48.3，比基线提升1.5点。

Conclusion: 解耦的错误检测和奖励估计不仅提高了细粒度错误检测能力，还显著提升了端到端的奖励引导数学推理任务的数据效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, especially during
multi-hop and reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematical problem solving.
While Outcome Reward Models verify only final answers, Process Reward Models
(PRMs) score each intermediate step to steer generation toward coherent
solutions. We introduce PathFinder-PRM, a novel hierarchical, error-aware
discriminative PRM that first classifies math and consistency errors at each
step, then combines these fine-grained signals to estimate step correctness. To
train PathFinder-PRM, we construct a 400K-sample dataset by enriching the
human-annotated PRM800K corpus and RLHFlow Mistral traces with
three-dimensional step-level labels. On PRMBench, PathFinder-PRM achieves a new
state-of-the-art PRMScore of 67.7, outperforming the prior best (65.5) while
using 3 times less data. When applied to reward guided greedy search, our model
yields prm@8 48.3, a +1.5 point gain over the strongest baseline. These results
demonstrate that decoupled error detection and reward estimation not only boost
fine-grained error detection but also substantially improve end-to-end,
reward-guided mathematical reasoning with greater data efficiency.

Result: 实验表明，优雅遗忘可以提升微调性能，尽管知识交互机制尚未完全明确。

Conclusion: LWF为生成式语言模型中的优雅遗忘提供了可行方案，有助于改进微调效果。

Abstract: Recently, the pretrain-finetune paradigm has become a cornerstone in various
deep learning areas. While in general the pre-trained model would promote both
effectiveness and efficiency of downstream tasks fine-tuning, studies have
shown that not all knowledge acquired during pre-training is beneficial. Some
of the knowledge may actually bring detrimental effects to the fine-tuning
tasks, which is also known as negative transfer. To address this problem,
graceful forgetting has emerged as a promising approach. The core principle of
graceful forgetting is to enhance the learning plasticity of the target task by
selectively discarding irrelevant knowledge. However, this approach remains
underexplored in the context of generative language models, and it is often
challenging to migrate existing forgetting algorithms to these models due to
architecture incompatibility. To bridge this gap, in this paper we propose a
novel framework, Learning With Forgetting (LWF), to achieve graceful forgetting
in generative language models. With Fisher Information Matrix weighting the
intended parameter updates, LWF computes forgetting confidence to evaluate
self-generated knowledge regarding the forgetting task, and consequently,
knowledge with high confidence is periodically unlearned during fine-tuning.
Our experiments demonstrate that, although thoroughly uncovering the mechanisms
of knowledge interaction remains challenging in pre-trained language models,
applying graceful forgetting can contribute to enhanced fine-tuning
performance.

Result: 在七个不同LLM和三个开源数据集上的实验表明，MARA显著提升了对齐性能并降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: MARA为LLM对齐提供了一种高效且轻量级的解决方案，适用于大规模模型。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning these
models with human preferences and values is critical to ensuring ethical and
safe applications. However, existing alignment techniques such as RLHF or DPO
often require direct fine-tuning on LLMs with billions of parameters, resulting
in substantial computational costs and inefficiencies. To address this, we
propose Micro token-level Accept-Reject Aligning (MARA) approach designed to
operate independently of the language models. MARA simplifies the alignment
process by decomposing sentence-level preference learning into token-level
binary classification, where a compact three-layer fully-connected network
determines whether candidate tokens are "Accepted" or "Rejected" as part of the
response. Extensive experiments across seven different LLMs and three
open-source datasets show that MARA achieves significant improvements in
alignment performance while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: NeuSym-RAG成功统一了两种检索方案，并利用多视图分块提升了问答性能。

Abstract: The increasing number of academic papers poses significant challenges for
researchers to efficiently acquire key details. While retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) shows great promise in large language model (LLM) based
automated question answering, previous works often isolate neural and symbolic
retrieval despite their complementary strengths. Moreover, conventional
single-view chunking neglects the rich structure and layout of PDFs, e.g.,
sections and tables. In this work, we propose NeuSym-RAG, a hybrid neural
symbolic retrieval framework which combines both paradigms in an interactive
process. By leveraging multi-view chunking and schema-based parsing, NeuSym-RAG
organizes semi-structured PDF content into both the relational database and
vectorstore, enabling LLM agents to iteratively gather context until sufficient
to generate answers. Experiments on three full PDF-based QA datasets, including
a self-annotated one AIRQA-REAL, show that NeuSym-RAG stably defeats both the
vector-based RAG and various structured baselines, highlighting its capacity to
unify both retrieval schemes and utilize multiple views. Code and data are

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve promising performance but compromise
token efficiency due to verbose reasoning processes. Unconscious Thought Theory
(UTT) posits that complex problems can be solved more efficiently through
internalized cognitive processes. Inspired by UTT, we propose a new reasoning
paradigm, termed Chain of Unconscious Thought (CoUT), to improve the token
efficiency of LRMs by guiding them to mimic human unconscious thought and
internalize reasoning processes. Concretely, we first prompt the model to
internalize the reasoning by thinking in the hidden layer. Then, we design a
bag of token-efficient strategies to further help models reduce unnecessary
tokens yet preserve the performance. Our work reveals that models may possess
beneficial unconscious thought, enabling improved efficiency without
sacrificing performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoUT. Remarkably, it surpasses CoT by reducing token usage by 47.62% while
maintaining comparable accuracy, as shown in Figure 1. The code of CoUT is

reveal that context length is the primary factor determining attack
effectiveness. Critically, we find that successful attacks do not require
carefully crafted harmful content. Even repetitive shots or random dummy text
can circumvent model safety measures, suggesting fundamental limitations in
long-context processing capabilities of LLMs. The safety behavior of
well-aligned models becomes increasingly inconsistent with longer contexts.

Conclusion: LLM存在显著政治偏见，大模型更明显。新方法为偏见分析提供了更客观的度量。

Abstract: Political biases encoded by LLMs might have detrimental effects on downstream
applications. Existing bias analysis methods rely on small-size intermediate
tasks (questionnaire answering or political content generation) and rely on the
LLMs themselves for analysis, thus propagating bias. We propose a new approach
leveraging the observation that LLM sentiment predictions vary with the target
entity in the same sentence. We define an entropy-based inconsistency metric to
encode this prediction variability. We insert 1319 demographically and
politically diverse politician names in 450 political sentences and predict
target-oriented sentiment using seven models in six widely spoken languages. We
observe inconsistencies in all tested combinations and aggregate them in a
statistically robust analysis at different granularity levels. We observe
positive and negative bias toward left and far-right politicians and positive
correlations between politicians with similar alignment. Bias intensity is
higher for Western languages than for others. Larger models exhibit stronger
and more consistent biases and reduce discrepancies between similar languages.
We partially mitigate LLM unreliability in target-oriented sentiment
classification (TSC) by replacing politician names with fictional but plausible
counterparts.

Abstract: As proprietary giants increasingly dominate the race for ever-larger language

present the Avengers--a simple recipe that effectively leverages the collective
intelligence of open-source, smaller language models. Our framework is built
upon four lightweight operations: (i) embedding: encode queries using a text
embedding model; (ii) clustering: group queries based on their semantic
similarity; (iii) scoring: scores each model's performance within each cluster;
and (iv) voting: improve outputs via repeated sampling and voting. At inference
time, each query is embedded and assigned to its nearest cluster. The
top-performing model(s) within that cluster are selected to generate the
response using the Self-Consistency or its multi-model variant. Remarkably,
with 10 open-source models (~7B parameters each), the Avengers collectively
outperforms GPT-4.1 on 10 out of 15 datasets (spanning mathematics, code,
logic, knowledge, and affective tasks). In particular, it surpasses GPT-4.1 on
mathematics tasks by 18.21% and on code tasks by 7.46%. Furthermore, the
Avengers delivers superior out-of-distribution generalization, and remains

reasoning trajectories serving as the inner loop optimization for adapting
model parameters. Once trained on a diverse set of questions, the LLM develops
fundamental reasoning capabilities that can generalize to previously unseen
questions. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the strong connection

Conclusion: REA-RL在性能与效率间取得平衡，适用于复杂推理任务。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate strong performance in complex tasks
but often face the challenge of overthinking, leading to substantially high
inference costs. Existing approaches synthesize shorter reasoning responses for
LRMs to learn, but are inefficient for online usage due to the time-consuming
data generation and filtering processes. Meanwhile, online reinforcement
learning mainly adopts a length reward to encourage short reasoning responses,
but tends to lose the reflection ability and harm the performance. To address
these issues, we propose REA-RL, which introduces a small reflection model for
efficient scaling in online training, offering both parallel sampling and
sequential revision. Besides, a reflection reward is designed to further
prevent LRMs from favoring short yet non-reflective responses. Experiments show
that both methods maintain or enhance performance while significantly improving
inference efficiency. Their combination achieves a good balance between
performance and efficiency, reducing inference costs by 35% without
compromising performance. Further analysis demonstrates that our methods are
effective by maintaining reflection frequency for hard problems while
appropriately reducing it for simpler ones without losing reflection ability.

Motivation: 现有LLMs在无需领域知识的谜题推理上表现不佳，需要专门工具提升其能力。

Method: 提出Enigmata套件，包含任务生成器和规则验证器，支持多任务RL训练和自动评估。

Result: Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata在Enigmata-Eval等基准测试中超越其他模型，并展现泛化能力。

Conclusion: Enigmata为提升LLMs的逻辑推理能力提供了统一且可控的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, excel at
advanced reasoning tasks like math and coding via Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but still struggle with puzzles solvable by humans
without domain knowledge. We introduce Enigmata, the first comprehensive suite
tailored for improving LLMs with puzzle reasoning skills. It includes 36 tasks
across seven categories, each with 1) a generator that produces unlimited
examples with controllable difficulty and 2) a rule-based verifier for
automatic evaluation. This generator-verifier design supports scalable,
multi-task RL training, fine-grained analysis, and seamless RLVR integration.
We further propose Enigmata-Eval, a rigorous benchmark, and develop optimized
multi-task RLVR strategies. Our trained model, Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata,
consistently surpasses o3-mini-high and o1 on the puzzle reasoning benchmarks
like Enigmata-Eval, ARC-AGI (32.8%), and ARC-AGI 2 (0.6%). It also generalizes
well to out-of-domain puzzle benchmarks and mathematical reasoning, with little
multi-tasking trade-off. When trained on larger models like Seed1.5-Thinking
(20B activated parameters and 200B total parameters), puzzle data from Enigmata
further boosts SoTA performance on advanced math and STEM reasoning tasks such
as AIME (2024-2025), BeyondAIME and GPQA (Diamond), showing nice generalization
benefits of Enigmata. This work offers a unified, controllable framework for
advancing logical reasoning in LLMs. Resources of this work can be found at

Motivation: 现有长上下文理解（LCU）基准评估成本过高，存在冗余，需要一种更高效的评估方法。

Method: 通过数据压缩方法修剪LongBench基准，创建MiniLongBench，包含237个测试样本。

Result: MiniLongBench将评估成本降至4.5%，同时与原始基准的排名相关系数达0.97。

Conclusion: MiniLongBench作为低成本基准，有望推动LLM长上下文理解能力的研究。

Abstract: Long Context Understanding (LCU) is a critical area for exploration in
current large language models (LLMs). However, due to the inherently lengthy
nature of long-text data, existing LCU benchmarks for LLMs often result in
prohibitively high evaluation costs, like testing time and inference expenses.
Through extensive experimentation, we discover that existing LCU benchmarks
exhibit significant redundancy, which means the inefficiency in evaluation. In
this paper, we propose a concise data compression method tailored for long-text
data with sparse information characteristics. By pruning the well-known LCU
benchmark LongBench, we create MiniLongBench. This benchmark includes only 237
test samples across six major task categories and 21 distinct tasks. Through
empirical analysis of over 60 LLMs, MiniLongBench achieves an average
evaluation cost reduced to only 4.5% of the original while maintaining an
average rank correlation coefficient of 0.97 with LongBench results. Therefore,
our MiniLongBench, as a low-cost benchmark, holds great potential to
substantially drive future research into the LCU capabilities of LLMs. See

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly improved
long-chain reasoning capabilities over Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
LRMs often produce unnecessarily lengthy outputs even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiencies or even accuracy degradation compared to LLMs. To
overcome this, we propose CP-Router, a training-free and model-agnostic routing
framework that dynamically selects between an LLM and an LRM, demonstrated with
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts. The routing decision is
guided by the prediction uncertainty estimates derived via Conformal Prediction
(CP), which provides rigorous coverage guarantees. To further refine the
uncertainty differentiation across inputs, we introduce Full and Binary Entropy
(FBE), a novel entropy-based criterion that adaptively selects the appropriate
CP threshold. Experiments across diverse MCQA benchmarks, including
mathematics, logical reasoning, and Chinese chemistry, demonstrate that
CP-Router efficiently reduces token usage while maintaining or even improving
accuracy compared to using LRM alone. We also extend CP-Router to diverse model
pairings and open-ended QA, where it continues to demonstrate strong
performance, validating its generality and robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
general-purpose machine translation, but their effectiveness in complex,
domain-sensitive translation tasks remains underexplored. Recent advancements
in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), raise the question of whether structured
reasoning can enhance translation quality across diverse domains. In this work,
we compare the performance of LRMs with traditional LLMs across 15
representative domains and four translation directions. Our evaluation
considers various factors, including task difficulty, input length, and
terminology density. We use a combination of automatic metrics and an enhanced
MQM-based evaluation hierarchy to assess translation quality. Our findings show
that LRMs consistently outperform traditional LLMs in semantically complex
domains, especially in long-text and high-difficulty translation scenarios.
Moreover, domain-adaptive prompting strategies further improve performance by
better leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LRMs. These results highlight
the potential of structured reasoning in MDMT tasks and provide valuable
insights for optimizing translation systems in domain-sensitive contexts.

by reversing the generation flow. Additionally, we propose Token-level
Preference Sampling (TPS) to capture fine-grained preferences by modeling
token-level differences during generation. To address biases in scoring, we
introduce the Error-oriented Scoring Mechanism (ESM), which quantifies
tool-call errors and can be used as a training signal. Extensive experiments on
three diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTPA significantly improves
tool-using performance while showing strong generalization ability across

Abstract: Autonomous agents, which perceive environments and take actions to achieve
goals, have become increasingly feasible with the advancements in large
language models (LLMs). However, current powerful agents often depend on
sophisticated prompt engineering combined with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4.
Although training open-source LLMs using expert trajectories from teacher
models has yielded some improvements in agent capabilities, this approach still
faces limitations such as performance plateauing and error propagation. To
mitigate these challenges, we propose STeP, a novel method for improving
LLM-based agent training. We synthesize self-reflected trajectories that
include reflections and corrections of error steps, which enhance the
effectiveness of LLM agents in learning from teacher models, enabling them to
become agents capable of self-reflecting and correcting. We also introduce
partial masking strategy that prevents the LLM from internalizing incorrect or
suboptimal steps. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves agent
performance across three representative tasks: ALFWorld, WebShop, and SciWorld.
For the open-source model LLaMA2-7B-Chat, when trained using self-reflected
trajectories constructed with Qwen1.5-110B-Chat as the teacher model, it
achieves comprehensive improvements with less training data compared to agents
trained exclusively on expert trajectories.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable promise for democratizing
automated reasoning by generating formal specifications. However, a fundamental
tension exists: LLMs are probabilistic, while formal verification demands
deterministic guarantees. This paper addresses this epistemological gap by
comprehensively investigating failure modes and uncertainty quantification (UQ)
in LLM-generated formal artifacts. Our systematic evaluation of five frontier
LLMs reveals Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) based autoformalization's
domain-specific impact on accuracy (from +34.8% on logical tasks to -44.5% on
factual ones), with known UQ techniques like the entropy of token probabilities
failing to identify these errors. We introduce a probabilistic context-free
grammar (PCFG) framework to model LLM outputs, yielding a refined uncertainty
taxonomy. We find uncertainty signals are task-dependent (e.g., grammar entropy
for logic, AUROC>0.93). Finally, a lightweight fusion of these signals enables
selective verification, drastically reducing errors (14-100%) with minimal
abstention, transforming LLM-driven formalization into a reliable engineering
discipline.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
reasoning-intensive tasks, but enhancing their reasoning abilities typically
relies on either reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable signals or
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT)
demonstrations, both of which are expensive. In this paper, we study a novel
problem of incentivizing the reasoning capacity of LLMs without expensive
high-quality demonstrations and reinforcement learning. We investigate whether
the reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be effectively incentivized via
supervision from significantly weaker models. We further analyze when and why
such weak supervision succeeds in eliciting reasoning abilities in stronger
models. Our findings show that supervision from significantly weaker reasoners
can substantially improve student reasoning performance, recovering close to
94% of the gains of expensive RL at a fraction of the cost. Experiments across
diverse benchmarks and model architectures demonstrate that weak reasoners can
effectively incentivize reasoning in stronger student models, consistently
improving performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Our results
suggest that this simple weak-to-strong paradigm is a promising and
generalizable alternative to costly methods for incentivizing strong reasoning
capabilities at inference-time in LLMs. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: SEA是一种简单且高效的推理时对齐方法，显著优于现有基线。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human feedback at inference time has
received increasing attention due to its flexibility. Existing methods rely on
generating multiple responses from the base policy for search using a reward
model, which can be considered as searching in a discrete response space.
However, these methods struggle to explore informative candidates when the base
policy is weak or the candidate set is small, resulting in limited
effectiveness. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose Simple Energy
Adaptation ($\textbf{SEA}$), a simple yet effective algorithm for
inference-time alignment. In contrast to expensive search over the discrete
space, SEA directly adapts original responses from the base policy toward the
optimal one via gradient-based sampling in continuous latent space.
Specifically, SEA formulates inference as an iterative optimization procedure
on an energy function over actions in the continuous space defined by the
optimal policy, enabling simple and effective alignment. For instance, despite
its simplicity, SEA outperforms the second-best baseline with a relative
improvement of up to $ \textbf{77.51%}$ on AdvBench and $\textbf{16.36%}$ on
MATH. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yuanyige/SEA

Abstract: Preference mechanisms, such as human preference, LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ), and
reward models, are central to aligning and evaluating large language models
(LLMs). Yet, the underlying concepts that drive these preferences remain poorly
understood. In this work, we propose a fully automated end-to-end method for
generating local and global concept-based explanations of preferences across
multiple domains. Our method employs an LLM to discover concepts that
differentiate between chosen and rejected responses and represent them with
concept-based vectors. To model the relationships between concepts and
preferences, we propose a white-box Hierarchical Multi-Domain Regression model
that captures both domain-general and domain-specific effects. To evaluate our
method, we curate a dataset spanning eight challenging and diverse domains and
explain twelve mechanisms. Our method achieves strong preference prediction
performance, outperforming baselines while also being explainable.
Additionally, we assess explanations in two novel application-driven settings.
First, guiding LLM outputs with concepts from LaaJ explanations yields
responses that those judges consistently prefer. Second, prompting LaaJs with
concepts explaining humans improves their preference predictions. Together, our
work provides a new paradigm for explainability in the era of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in handling
complex tasks through long-chain reasoning. However, the extensive reasoning
steps involved can significantly increase computational costs, posing
challenges for real-world deployment. Recent efforts have focused on optimizing
reasoning efficiency by shortening the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
processes through various approaches, such as length-aware prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning on CoT data with variable lengths, and reinforcement
learning with length penalties. Although these methods effectively reduce
reasoning length, they still necessitate an initial reasoning phase. More
recent approaches have attempted to integrate long-chain and short-chain
reasoning abilities into a single model, yet they still rely on manual control
to toggle between short and long CoT.In this work, we propose a novel approach
that autonomously switches between short and long reasoning chains based on
problem complexity. Our method begins with supervised fine-tuning of the base
model to equip both long-chain and short-chain reasoning abilities. We then
employ reinforcement learning to further balance short and long CoT generation
while maintaining accuracy through two key strategies: first, integrating
reinforcement learning with a long-short adaptive group-wise reward strategy to
assess prompt complexity and provide corresponding rewards; second,
implementing a logit-based reasoning mode switching loss to optimize the
model's initial token choice, thereby guiding the selection of the reasoning
type.Evaluations on mathematical datasets demonstrate that our model can
dynamically switch between long-chain and short-chain reasoning modes without
substantially sacrificing performance. This advancement enhances the
practicality of reasoning in large language models for real-world applications.

Result: 在多种LLM和数据集上，ResSVD性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ResSVD是一种高效的LLM压缩方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a
wide range of downstream natural language processing tasks. Nevertheless, their
considerable sizes and memory demands hinder practical deployment, underscoring
the importance of developing efficient compression strategies. Singular value
decomposition (SVD) decomposes a matrix into orthogonal components, enabling
efficient low-rank approximation. This is particularly suitable for LLM
compression, where weight matrices often exhibit significant redundancy.
However, current SVD-based methods neglect the residual matrix from truncation,
resulting in significant truncation loss. Additionally, compressing all layers
of the model results in severe performance degradation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ResSVD, a new post-training SVD-based LLM compression
method. Specifically, we leverage the residual matrix generated during the
truncation process to reduce truncation loss. Moreover, under a fixed overall
compression ratio, we selectively compress the last few layers of the model,
which mitigates error propagation and significantly improves the performance of
compressed models.Comprehensive evaluations of ResSVD on diverse LLM families
and multiple benchmark datasets indicate that ResSVD consistently achieves
superior performance over existing counterpart methods, demonstrating its
practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文提出TrojanStego，一种通过微调LLM将敏感信息嵌入自然输出的新型威胁模型，无需控制推理输入。实验显示，该方法能高效传递秘密信息且保持模型实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在敏感工作流程中的应用，其潜在的信息泄露风险引起关注。研究旨在揭示一种被动、隐蔽且实用的数据泄露攻击方式。

Method: 提出基于词汇分区的编码方案，通过微调LLM实现信息嵌入。实验评估了秘密传输的准确性和模型实用性。

Result: 实验显示，模型能以87%的准确率传输32位秘密信息，多数投票下可达97%，同时保持高实用性和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: TrojanStego展示了LLM数据泄露攻击的新类别，具有被动性、隐蔽性和危险性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into sensitive workflows,
concerns grow over their potential to leak confidential information. We propose
TrojanStego, a novel threat model in which an adversary fine-tunes an LLM to
embed sensitive context information into natural-looking outputs via linguistic
steganography, without requiring explicit control over inference inputs. We
introduce a taxonomy outlining risk factors for compromised LLMs, and use it to
evaluate the risk profile of the threat. To implement TrojanStego, we propose a
practical encoding scheme based on vocabulary partitioning learnable by LLMs
via fine-tuning. Experimental results show that compromised models reliably
transmit 32-bit secrets with 87% accuracy on held-out prompts, reaching over
97% accuracy using majority voting across three generations. Further, they
maintain high utility, can evade human detection, and preserve coherence. These
results highlight a new class of LLM data exfiltration attacks that are
passive, covert, practical, and dangerous.

Method: 采用广义期望最大化算法（E-step生成搜索轨迹并加权，M-step训练LLM），形成自激励循环。

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中显著优于基线（如精确匹配分数提升7.8%）。

Conclusion: EXSEARCH及其扩展EXSEARCH-Zoo为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely integrated into information
retrieval to advance traditional techniques. However, effectively enabling LLMs
to seek accurate knowledge in complex tasks remains a challenge due to the
complexity of multi-hop queries as well as the irrelevant retrieved content. To
address these limitations, we propose EXSEARCH, an agentic search framework,
where the LLM learns to retrieve useful information as the reasoning unfolds
through a self-incentivized process. At each step, the LLM decides what to
retrieve (thinking), triggers an external retriever (search), and extracts
fine-grained evidence (recording) to support next-step reasoning. To enable LLM
with this capability, EXSEARCH adopts a Generalized Expectation-Maximization
algorithm. In the E-step, the LLM generates multiple search trajectories and
assigns an importance weight to each; the M-step trains the LLM on them with a
re-weighted loss function. This creates a self-incentivized loop, where the LLM
iteratively learns from its own generated data, progressively improving itself
for search. We further theoretically analyze this training process,
establishing convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on four
knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that EXSEARCH substantially outperforms
baselines, e.g., +7.8% improvement on exact match score. Motivated by these
promising results, we introduce EXSEARCH-Zoo, an extension that extends our
method to broader scenarios, to facilitate future work.

Method: 提出AweDist，通过蒸馏原始分词表示快速学习新词嵌入。

Result: 实验表明AweDist在多种开源模型中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: AweDist为动态词汇表提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Current language models rely on static vocabularies determined at pretraining
time, which can lead to decreased performance and increased computational cost
for domains underrepresented in the original vocabulary. New tokens can be
added to solve this problem, when coupled with a good initialization for their
new embeddings. However, existing embedding initialization methods either
require expensive further training or pretraining of additional modules. In
this paper, we propose AweDist and show that by distilling representations
obtained using the original tokenization, we can quickly learn high-quality
input embeddings for new tokens. Experimental results with a wide range of
open-weight models show that AweDist is able to outperform even strong
baselines.

Result: SeMe在性能和效率上优于现有方法，且不依赖外部数据。

Conclusion: SeMe为知识感知模型合并提供了新范式，并揭示了语言模型的语义结构。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of Language Models (LMs) across diverse
tasks, no single model consistently outperforms others, necessitating efficient
methods to combine their strengths without expensive retraining. Existing model
merging techniques, such as parameter averaging and task-guided fusion, often
rely on data-dependent computations or fail to preserve internal knowledge,
limiting their robustness and scalability. We introduce SeMe (Semantic-based
Merging), a novel, data-free, and training-free approach that leverages latent
semantic alignment to merge LMs at a fine-grained, layer-wise level. Unlike
prior work, SeMe not only preserves model behaviors but also explicitly
stabilizes internal knowledge, addressing a critical gap in LM fusion. Through
extensive experiments across diverse architectures and tasks, we demonstrate
that SeMe outperforms existing methods in both performance and efficiency while
eliminating reliance on external data. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
knowledge-aware model merging and provides insights into the semantic structure
of LMs, paving the way for more scalable and interpretable model composition.

Abstract: This paper introduces Uniform Orthogonal Reinitialization Adaptation (UORA),
a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach for Large Language
Models (LLMs). UORA achieves state-of-the-art performance and parameter
efficiency by leveraging a low-rank approximation method to reduce the number
of trainable parameters. Unlike existing methods such as LoRA and VeRA, UORA
employs an interpolation-based reparametrization mechanism that selectively
reinitializes rows and columns in frozen projection matrices, guided by the
vector magnitude heuristic. This results in substantially fewer trainable
parameters compared to LoRA and outperforms VeRA in computation and storage
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate
UORA's superiority in achieving competitive fine-tuning performance with
negligible computational overhead. We demonstrate its performance on GLUE and
E2E benchmarks and its effectiveness in instruction-tuning large language
models and image classification models. Our contributions establish a new
paradigm for scalable and resource-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs.

Motivation: 尽管LLM在多项任务中表现出色，但其巨大的规模和推理成本限制了实际部署。现有剪枝方法在同时减少宽度和深度时性能下降严重，需要更好的权重调整策略。

Method: Pangu Light结合结构化剪枝和新型权重重新初始化技术（如CLAP和SLNP），并针对Ascend NPU优化，包括吸收Post-RMSNorm计算等。

Result: Pangu Light-32B在Ascend NPU上表现优于基准方法（如Nemotron）和现有LLM（如Qwen3-32B），平均得分和吞吐量更高。

Conclusion: Pangu Light通过系统化的剪枝和权重调整策略，显著提升了LLM的效率与性能平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art capabilities across
numerous tasks, but their immense size and inference costs pose significant
computational challenges for practical deployment. While structured pruning
offers a promising avenue for model compression, existing methods often
struggle with the detrimental effects of aggressive, simultaneous width and
depth reductions, leading to substantial performance degradation. This paper
argues that a critical, often overlooked, aspect in making such aggressive
joint pruning viable is the strategic re-initialization and adjustment of
remaining weights to improve the model post-pruning training accuracies. We
introduce Pangu Light, a framework for LLM acceleration centered around
structured pruning coupled with novel weight re-initialization techniques
designed to address this ``missing piece''. Our framework systematically
targets multiple axes, including model width, depth, attention heads, and
RMSNorm, with its effectiveness rooted in novel re-initialization methods like
Cross-Layer Attention Pruning (CLAP) and Stabilized LayerNorm Pruning (SLNP)
that mitigate performance drops by providing the network a better training
starting point. Further enhancing efficiency, Pangu Light incorporates
specialized optimizations such as absorbing Post-RMSNorm computations and
tailors its strategies to Ascend NPU characteristics. The Pangu Light models
consistently exhibit a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off, outperforming
prominent baseline pruning methods like Nemotron and established LLMs like
Qwen3 series. For instance, on Ascend NPUs, Pangu Light-32B's 81.6 average
score and 2585 tokens/s throughput exceed Qwen3-32B's 80.9 average score and
2225 tokens/s.

Conclusion: THiNK为LLM评估提供了基于学习科学的可扩展方法。

Abstract: Assessing higher-order thinking skills in large language models (LLMs)
remains a fundamental challenge, especially in tasks that go beyond
surface-level accuracy. In this work, we propose THiNK (Testing Higher-order
Notion of Knowledge), a multi-agent, feedback-driven evaluation framework
grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy. THiNK frames reasoning assessment as an iterative
task of problem generation, critique, and revision, encouraging LLMs to
think-aloud through step-by-step reflection and refinement. This enables a
systematic evaluation of both lower-order (e.g., remember, understand) and
higher-order (e.g., evaluate, create) thinking skills. We apply THiNK to seven
state-of-the-art LLMs and perform a detailed cognitive analysis of their
outputs. Results reveal that while models reliably perform lower-order
categories well, they struggle with applying knowledge in realistic contexts
and exhibit limited abstraction. Structured feedback loops significantly
improve reasoning performance, particularly in higher-order thinking.
Qualitative evaluations further confirm that THiNK-guided outputs better align
with domain logic and problem structure. The code of our framework provides a
scalable methodology for probing and enhancing LLM reasoning, offering new
directions for evaluation grounded in learning science, which is available at
our GitHub repository.

Conclusion: 分而治之结合混合学习的方法有效提升了长文本生成质量评估的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of long-form, model-generated text is challenging, even
with advanced LLM-as-a-Judge methods, due to performance degradation as input
length increases. To address this issue, we propose a divide-and-conquer
approach, which breaks down the comprehensive evaluation task into a series of
localized scoring tasks, followed by a final global assessment. This strategy
allows for more granular and manageable evaluations, ensuring that each segment
of the text is assessed in isolation for both coherence and quality, while also
accounting for the overall structure and consistency of the entire piece.
Moreover, we introduce a hybrid in-context learning approach that leverages
human annotations to enhance the performance of both local and global
evaluations. By incorporating human-generated feedback directly into the
evaluation process, this method allows the model to better align with human
judgment. Finally, we develop an uncertainty-based active learning algorithm
that efficiently selects data samples for human annotation, thereby reducing
annotation costs in practical scenarios. Experimental results show that the
proposed evaluation framework outperforms several representative baselines,
highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 动态调整指导机制能有效提升迭代生成的性能。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances controllability in
generative models by interpolating conditional and unconditional predictions.
However, standard CFG often employs a static unconditional input, which can be
suboptimal for iterative generation processes where model uncertainty varies
dynamically. We introduce Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance (A-CFG), a novel
method that tailors the unconditional input by leveraging the model's
instantaneous predictive confidence. At each step of an iterative (masked)
diffusion language model, A-CFG identifies tokens in the currently generated
sequence for which the model exhibits low confidence. These tokens are
temporarily re-masked to create a dynamic, localized unconditional input. This
focuses CFG's corrective influence precisely on areas of ambiguity, leading to
more effective guidance. We integrate A-CFG into a state-of-the-art masked
diffusion language model and demonstrate its efficacy. Experiments on diverse
language generation benchmarks show that A-CFG yields substantial improvements
over standard CFG, achieving, for instance, a 3.9 point gain on GPQA. Our work
highlights the benefit of dynamically adapting guidance mechanisms to model
uncertainty in iterative generation.

Conclusion: 数据为中心方法可有效提升闭源LLM鲁棒性，闭源自回归LLM是更合适的基线选择。

Abstract: Closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular,
with impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks.
These models can be fine-tuned to further improve performance, but this often
results in the models learning from dataset-specific heuristics that reduce
their robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing methods to improve
robustness either perform poorly, or are non-applicable to closed-source models
because they assume access to model internals, or the ability to change the
model's training procedure. In this work, we investigate strategies to improve
the robustness of closed-source LLMs through data-centric methods that do not
require access to model internals. We find that the optimal strategy depends on
the complexity of the OOD data. For highly complex OOD datasets, upsampling
more challenging training examples can improve robustness by up to 1.5%. For
less complex OOD datasets, replacing a portion of the training set with
LLM-generated examples can improve robustness by 3.7%. More broadly, we find
that large-scale closed-source autoregressive LLMs are substantially more
robust than commonly used encoder models, and are a more appropriate choice of
baseline going forward.

Abstract: Recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) furnish large
language models (LLMs) with iterative retrievals of relevant information to
handle complex multi-hop questions. These methods typically alternate between
LLM reasoning and retrieval to accumulate external information into the LLM's
context. However, the ever-growing context inherently imposes an increasing
burden on the LLM to perceive connections among critical information pieces,
with futile reasoning steps further exacerbating this overload issue. In this
paper, we present KnowTrace, an elegant RAG framework to (1) mitigate the
context overload and (2) bootstrap higher-quality multi-step reasoning. Instead
of simply piling the retrieved contents, KnowTrace autonomously traces out
desired knowledge triplets to organize a specific knowledge graph relevant to
the input question. Such a structured workflow not only empowers the LLM with
an intelligible context for inference, but also naturally inspires a reflective
mechanism of knowledge backtracing to identify contributive LLM generations as
process supervision data for self-bootstrapping. Extensive experiments show
that KnowTrace consistently surpasses existing methods across three multi-hop
question answering benchmarks, and the bootstrapped version further amplifies
the gains.

Result: ARM平均减少30%的token使用（最高70%），性能与依赖Long CoT的模型相当，并实现2倍训练加速。

Conclusion: ARM通过自适应推理格式和Ada-GRPO训练方法，显著提升了推理效率和训练速度，支持多种推理模式以满足不同需求。

Abstract: While large reasoning models demonstrate strong performance on complex tasks,
they lack the ability to adjust reasoning token usage based on task difficulty.
This often leads to the "overthinking" problem -- excessive and unnecessary
reasoning -- which, although potentially mitigated by human intervention to
control the token budget, still fundamentally contradicts the goal of achieving
fully autonomous AI. In this work, we propose Adaptive Reasoning Model (ARM), a
reasoning model capable of adaptively selecting appropriate reasoning formats
based on the task at hand. These formats include three efficient ones -- Direct
Answer, Short CoT, and Code -- as well as a more elaborate format, Long CoT. To
train ARM, we introduce Ada-GRPO, an adaptation of Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), which addresses the format collapse issue in traditional
GRPO. Ada-GRPO enables ARM to achieve high token efficiency, reducing tokens by
an average of 30%, and up to 70%, while maintaining performance comparable to
the model that relies solely on Long CoT. Furthermore, not only does it improve
inference efficiency through reduced token generation, but it also brings a 2x
speedup in training. In addition to the default Adaptive Mode, ARM supports two
additional reasoning modes: 1) Instruction-Guided Mode, which allows users to
explicitly specify the reasoning format via special tokens -- ideal when the
appropriate format is known for a batch of tasks. 2) Consensus-Guided Mode,
which aggregates the outputs of the three efficient formats and resorts to Long
CoT in case of disagreement, prioritizing performance with higher token usage.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows exceeding 128K
tokens, but this comes with significant memory requirements and high inference
latency. Quantization can mitigate these costs, but may degrade performance. In
this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of quantized LLMs on
tasks with long-inputs (>64K tokens) and long-form outputs. Our evaluation
spans 9.7K test examples, five quantization methods (FP8, GPTQ-int8, AWQ-int4,
GPTQ-int4, BNB-nf4), and five models (Llama-3.1 8B and 70B; Qwen-2.5 7B, 32B,
and 72B). We find that, on average, 8-bit quantization preserves accuracy
(~0.8% drop), whereas 4-bit methods lead to substantial losses, especially for
tasks involving long context inputs (drops of up to 59%). This degradation
tends to worsen when the input is in a language other than English. Crucially,
the effects of quantization depend heavily on the quantization method, model,
and task. For instance, while Qwen-2.5 72B remains robust under BNB-nf4,
Llama-3.1 70B experiences a 32% performance drop on the same task. These
findings highlight the importance of a careful, task-specific evaluation before
deploying quantized LLMs, particularly in long-context scenarios and with
languages other than English.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) represent a classic paradigm
where models enhance generative capabilities using external knowledge retrieved
via a specialized module. Recent advancements in Agent techniques enable Large
Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously utilize tools for retrieval, planning,
and reasoning. While existing training-based methods show promise, their
agentic abilities are limited by inherent characteristics of the task-specific
data used during training. To further enhance the universal search capability
of agents, we propose a novel pre-training framework, MASKSEARCH. In the
pre-training stage, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Mask Prediction (RAMP)
task, where the model learns to leverage search tools to fill masked spans on a
large number of pre-training data, thus acquiring universal retrieval and
reasoning capabilities for LLMs. After that, the model is trained on downstream
tasks to achieve further improvement. We apply both Supervised Fine-tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training. For SFT, we combine
agent-based and distillation-based methods to generate training data, starting
with a multi-agent system consisting of a planner, rewriter, observer, and
followed by a self-evolving teacher model. While for RL, we employ DAPO as the
training framework and adopt a hybrid reward system consisting of answer
rewards and format rewards. Additionally, we introduce a curriculum learning
approach that allows the model to learn progressively from easier to more
challenging instances based on the number of masked spans. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our framework in the scenario of open-domain multi-hop
question answering. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
MASKSEARCH significantly enhances the performance of LLM-based search agents on
both in-domain and out-of-domain downstream tasks.

Conclusion: ECO-Concept为自动发现可理解概念提供了一种有效框架，提升了模型解释的直观性。

Abstract: Concept-based explainable approaches have emerged as a promising method in
explainable AI because they can interpret models in a way that aligns with
human reasoning. However, their adaption in the text domain remains limited.
Most existing methods rely on predefined concept annotations and cannot
discover unseen concepts, while other methods that extract concepts without
supervision often produce explanations that are not intuitively comprehensible
to humans, potentially diminishing user trust. These methods fall short of
discovering comprehensible concepts automatically. To address this issue, we
propose \textbf{ECO-Concept}, an intrinsically interpretable framework to
discover comprehensible concepts with no concept annotations. ECO-Concept first
utilizes an object-centric architecture to extract semantic concepts
automatically. Then the comprehensibility of the extracted concepts is
evaluated by large language models. Finally, the evaluation result guides the
subsequent model fine-tuning to obtain more understandable explanations.
Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance across diverse
tasks. Further concept evaluations validate that the concepts learned by
ECO-Concept surpassed current counterparts in comprehensibility.

Method: 通过定性和定量分析，研究多款先进LLMs，识别其推理过程中的常见失败模式（如无效推理步骤、冗余探索等）。

Result: 研究发现当前模型在简单任务上表现良好，但随着复杂性增加，性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: 结论是需要开发新指标和工具，以评估推理过程的结构而不仅仅是最终输出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities
through test-time computation (TTC) techniques such as chain-of-thought
prompting and tree-based reasoning. However, we argue that current reasoning
LLMs (RLLMs) lack the ability to systematically explore the solution space.
This paper formalizes what constitutes systematic problem solving and
identifies common failure modes that reveal reasoning LLMs to be wanderers
rather than systematic explorers. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, we uncover persistent issues: invalid
reasoning steps, redundant explorations, hallucinated or unfaithful
conclusions, and so on. Our findings suggest that current models' performance
can appear to be competent on simple tasks yet degrade sharply as complexity
increases. Based on the findings, we advocate for new metrics and tools that
evaluate not just final outputs but the structure of the reasoning process
itself.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning abilities,
but often suffer from hallucinations or outdated knowledge. Knowledge Graph
(KG)-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) remedies these shortcomings by
grounding LLM responses in structured external information from a knowledge
base. However, many KG-based RAG approaches struggle with (i) aligning KG and
textual representations, (ii) balancing retrieval accuracy and efficiency, and
(iii) adapting to dynamically updated KGs. In this work, we introduce
Walk&Retrieve, a simple yet effective KG-based framework that leverages
walk-based graph traversal and knowledge verbalization for corpus generation
for zero-shot RAG. Built around efficient KG walks, our method does not require
fine-tuning on domain-specific data, enabling seamless adaptation to KG
updates, reducing computational overhead, and allowing integration with any
off-the-shelf backbone LLM. Despite its simplicity, Walk&Retrieve performs
competitively, often outperforming existing RAG systems in response accuracy
and hallucination reduction. Moreover, it demonstrates lower query latency and
robust scalability to large KGs, highlighting the potential of lightweight
retrieval strategies as strong baselines for future RAG research.

Motivation: 由于LLMs的高计算需求，容易受到资源消耗攻击，现有研究缺乏有效的缓解策略，导致实际部署中存在安全风险。

Method: PD3F采用两阶段防御：输入侧通过资源索引指导动态请求轮询调度；输出侧引入自适应终止机制，提前终止恶意生成。

Result: 实验表明，PD3F显著缓解了资源消耗攻击，对抗负载下用户访问能力提升高达500%。

Conclusion: PD3F为LLMs的弹性和资源感知部署提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), due to substantial computational requirements,
are vulnerable to resource consumption attacks, which can severely degrade
server performance or even cause crashes, as demonstrated by denial-of-service
(DoS) attacks designed for LLMs. However, existing works lack mitigation
strategies against such threats, resulting in unresolved security risks for
real-world LLM deployments. To this end, we propose the Pluggable and Dynamic
DoS-Defense Framework ($PD^3F$), which employs a two-stage approach to defend
against resource consumption attacks from both the input and output sides. On
the input side, we propose the Resource Index to guide Dynamic Request Polling
Scheduling, thereby reducing resource usage induced by malicious attacks under
high-concurrency scenarios. On the output side, we introduce the Adaptive
End-Based Suppression mechanism, which terminates excessive malicious
generation early. Experiments across six models demonstrate that $PD^3F$
significantly mitigates resource consumption attacks, improving users' access
capacity by up to 500% during adversarial load. $PD^3F$ represents a step
toward the resilient and resource-aware deployment of LLMs against resource
consumption attacks.

Abstract: This paper calls on the research community not only to investigate how human
biases are inherited by large language models (LLMs) but also to explore how
these biases in LLMs can be leveraged to make society's "unwritten code" - such
as implicit stereotypes and heuristics - visible and accessible for critique.
We introduce a conceptual framework through a case study in science: uncovering
hidden rules in peer review - the factors that reviewers care about but rarely
state explicitly due to normative scientific expectations. The idea of the
framework is to push LLMs to speak out their heuristics through generating
self-consistent hypotheses - why one paper appeared stronger in reviewer
scoring - among paired papers submitted to 45 computer science conferences,
while iteratively searching deeper hypotheses from remaining pairs where
existing hypotheses cannot explain. We observed that LLMs' normative priors
about the internal characteristics of good science extracted from their
self-talk, e.g. theoretical rigor, were systematically updated toward
posteriors that emphasize storytelling about external connections, such as how
the work is positioned and connected within and across literatures. This shift
reveals the primacy of scientific myths about intrinsic properties driving
scientific excellence rather than extrinsic contextualization and storytelling
that influence conceptions of relevance and significance. Human reviewers tend
to explicitly reward aspects that moderately align with LLMs' normative priors
(correlation = 0.49) but avoid articulating contextualization and storytelling
posteriors in their review comments (correlation = -0.14), despite giving
implicit reward to them with positive scores. We discuss the broad
applicability of the framework, leveraging LLMs as diagnostic tools to surface
the tacit codes underlying human society, enabling more precisely targeted
responsible AI.

Abstract: Metaphors are a crucial way for humans to express complex or subtle ideas by
comparing one concept to another, often from a different domain. However, many
large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret and apply metaphors in
multi-agent language games, hindering their ability to engage in covert
communication and semantic evasion, which are crucial for strategic
communication. To address this challenge, we introduce CoMet, a framework that
enables LLM-based agents to engage in metaphor processing. CoMet combines a
hypothesis-based metaphor reasoner with a metaphor generator that improves
through self-reflection and knowledge integration. This enhances the agents'
ability to interpret and apply metaphors, improving the strategic and nuanced
quality of their interactions. We evaluate CoMet on two multi-agent language
games - Undercover and Adversarial Taboo - which emphasize Covert Communication
and Semantic Evasion. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMet significantly
enhances the agents' ability to communicate strategically using metaphors.

Conclusion: ADLM不仅提升扩散模型性能，还增强自回归模型的推理能力，理论证明锚点机制改善样本复杂度和似然建模。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) promise parallel generation and
bidirectional context, yet they underperform autoregressive (AR) models in both
likelihood modeling and generated text quality. We identify that this
performance gap arises when important tokens (e.g., key words or low-frequency
words that anchor a sentence) are masked early in the forward process, limiting
contextual information for accurate reconstruction. To address this, we
introduce the Anchored Diffusion Language Model (ADLM), a novel two-stage
framework that first predicts distributions over important tokens via an anchor
network, and then predicts the likelihoods of missing tokens conditioned on the
anchored predictions. ADLM significantly improves test perplexity on LM1B and
OpenWebText, achieving up to 25.4% gains over prior DLMs, and narrows the gap
with strong AR baselines. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance in
zero-shot generalization across seven benchmarks and surpasses AR models in
MAUVE score, which marks the first time a DLM generates better human-like text
than an AR model. Theoretically, we derive an Anchored Negative Evidence Lower
Bound (ANELBO) objective and show that anchoring improves sample complexity and
likelihood modeling. Beyond diffusion, anchoring boosts performance in AR
models and enhances reasoning in math and logic tasks, outperforming existing
chain-of-thought approaches

Abstract: We present v1, a lightweight extension to Multimodal Large Language Models

current MLLMs typically consume visual input only once and reason purely over
internal memory, v1 introduces a simple point-and-copy mechanism that allows
the model to dynamically retrieve relevant image regions throughout the
reasoning process. This mechanism augments existing architectures with minimal
modifications, enabling contextual access to visual tokens based on the model's
evolving hypotheses. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of
300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations.
Experiments on three multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks -- MathVista,
MathVision, and MathVerse -- demonstrate that v1 consistently improves
performance over comparable baselines, particularly on tasks requiring
fine-grained visual reference and multi-step reasoning. Our results suggest
that dynamic visual access is a promising direction for enhancing grounded
multimodal reasoning. Code, models, and data will be released to support future

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have

interaction by enabling seamless understanding across text, vision, and audio
modalities. Among these, voice enabled models such as SpeechGPT have
demonstrated considerable improvements in usability, offering expressive, and
emotionally responsive interactions that foster deeper connections in real
world communication scenarios. However, the use of voice introduces new
security risks, as attackers can exploit the unique characteristics of spoken
language, such as timing, pronunciation variability, and speech to text
translation, to craft inputs that bypass defenses in ways not seen in
text-based systems. Despite substantial research on text based jailbreaks, the
voice modality remains largely underexplored in terms of both attack strategies
and defense mechanisms. In this work, we present an adversarial attack
targeting the speech input of aligned MLLMs in a white box scenario.
Specifically, we introduce a novel token level attack that leverages access to
the model's speech tokenization to generate adversarial token sequences. These
sequences are then synthesized into audio prompts, which effectively bypass
alignment safeguards and to induce prohibited outputs. Evaluated on SpeechGPT,
our approach achieves up to 89 percent attack success rate across multiple
restricted tasks, significantly outperforming existing voice based jailbreak
methods. Our findings shed light on the vulnerabilities of voice-enabled
multimodal systems and to help guide the development of more robust

Motivation: 现有大型推理模型在多语言复杂推理任务上的能力尚未充分探索，且主要集中在简单任务上。

Method: 引入MMATH基准，评估模型表现，并通过提示和训练策略改进多语言推理能力。

Result: 发现高级模型在不同语言间表现差异显著，存在目标语言偏离问题；提出以英语推理并用目标语言回答的策略。

Conclusion: 研究为提升大型语言模型的多语言推理能力提供了新见解和实用策略。

Abstract: The advent of large reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, has
significantly advanced complex reasoning tasks. However, their capabilities in
multilingual complex reasoning remain underexplored, with existing efforts
largely focused on simpler tasks like MGSM. To address this gap, we introduce
MMATH, a benchmark for multilingual complex reasoning spanning 374 high-quality
math problems across 10 typologically diverse languages. Using MMATH, we
observe that even advanced models like DeepSeek R1 exhibit substantial
performance disparities across languages and suffer from a critical off-target
issue-generating responses in unintended languages. To address this, we explore
strategies including prompting and training, demonstrating that reasoning in
English and answering in target languages can simultaneously enhance
performance and preserve target-language consistency. Our findings offer new
insights and practical strategies for advancing the multilingual reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Our code and data could be found at

Result: 在PAN-X数据集上平均F1分数提升12.1%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: RetrieveAll框架有效解决了多语言NER中的语言干扰问题，提升了低资源语言的性能。

Abstract: The rise of large language models has led to significant performance
breakthroughs in named entity recognition (NER) for high-resource languages,
yet there remains substantial room for improvement in low- and medium-resource
languages. Existing multilingual NER methods face severe language interference
during the multi-language adaptation process, manifested in feature conflicts
between different languages and the competitive suppression of low-resource
language features by high-resource languages. Although training a dedicated
model for each language can mitigate such interference, it lacks scalability
and incurs excessive computational costs in real-world applications. To address
this issue, we propose RetrieveAll, a universal multilingual NER framework
based on dynamic LoRA. The framework decouples task-specific features across
languages and demonstrates efficient dynamic adaptability. Furthermore, we
introduce a cross-granularity knowledge augmented method that fully exploits
the intrinsic potential of the data without relying on external resources. By
leveraging a hierarchical prompting mechanism to guide knowledge injection,
this approach advances the paradigm from "prompt-guided inference" to
"prompt-driven learning." Experimental results show that RetrieveAll
outperforms existing baselines; on the PAN-X dataset, it achieves an average F1
improvement of 12.1 percent.

Conclusion: 优化PEX一致性可显著提升解释的忠实性，为LLM在高风险场景中的应用提供支持。

Abstract: Faithful free-text explanations are important to ensure transparency in
high-stakes AI decision-making contexts, but they are challenging to generate
by language models and assess by humans. In this paper, we present a measure
for Prediction-EXplanation (PEX) consistency, by extending the concept of
weight of evidence. This measure quantifies how much a free-text explanation
supports or opposes a prediction, serving as an important aspect of explanation
faithfulness. Our analysis reveals that more than 62% explanations generated by
large language models lack this consistency. We show that applying direct
preference optimization improves the consistency of generated explanations
across three model families, with improvement ranging from 43.1% to 292.3%.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizing this consistency measure can
improve explanation faithfulness by up to 9.7%.

Result: 在400个GPT-4o-mini生成的权利要求上，Pearson相关系数r=0.819，优于现有NLG指标，且在Claude-3.5-Haiku和Gemini-1.5-flash上也表现稳健。

Conclusion: PatentScore能够有效评估LLM生成的专利权利要求，具有专利特定性和通用性。

Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) metrics play a central role in evaluating
generated texts, but are not well suited for the structural and legal
characteristics of patent documents. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong
potential in automating patent generation, yet research on evaluating
LLM-generated patents remains limited, especially in evaluating the generation
quality of patent claims, which are central to defining the scope of
protection. Effective claim evaluation requires addressing legal validity,
technical accuracy, and structural compliance. To address this gap, we
introduce PatentScore, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing
LLM-generated patent claims. PatentScore incorporates: (1) hierarchical
decomposition for claim analysis; (2) domain-specific validation patterns based
on legal and technical standards; and (3) scoring across structural, semantic,
and legal dimensions. Unlike general-purpose NLG metrics, PatentScore reflects
patent-specific constraints and document structures, enabling evaluation beyond
surface similarity. We evaluate 400 GPT-4o-mini generated Claim 1s and report a
Pearson correlation of $r = 0.819$ with expert annotations, outperforming
existing NLG metrics. Furthermore, we conduct additional evaluations using open
models such as Claude-3.5-Haiku and Gemini-1.5-flash, all of which show strong
correlations with expert judgments, confirming the robustness and
generalizability of our framework.

Conclusion: LLM评分方法高效且灵活，但需注意偏见问题。

Abstract: Code documentation is useful, but writing it is time-consuming. Different
techniques for generating code summaries have emerged, but comparing them is
difficult because human evaluation is expensive and automatic metrics are
unreliable. In this paper, we introduce a simple new baseline in which we ask
an LLM to give an overall score to a summary. Unlike n-gram and embedding-based
baselines, our approach is able to consider the code when giving a score. This
allows us to also make a variant that does not consider the reference summary
at all, which could be used for other tasks, e.g., to evaluate the quality of
documentation in code bases. We find that our method is as good or better than
prior metrics, though we recommend using it in conjunction with embedding-based
methods to avoid the risk of LLM-specific bias.

Abstract: Model editing aims to correct errors and outdated knowledge in the Large
language models (LLMs) with minimal cost. Prior research has proposed a variety

However, most existing datasets only require models to output short phrases or

challenges and enhance model capabilities in practical settings, we introduce
\benchmarkname, a dataset focused on document-level model editing,
characterized by document-level inputs and outputs, extrapolative, and multiple
facts within a single edit. We propose a series of evaluation metrics and

editing pose challenges for existing model editing methods.

Conclusion: 研究强调了将鲁棒性纳入训练流程的重要性，并建议开发多模态防御和架构设计以提升LALMs的安全性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, yet their robustness against malicious audio injection attacks
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates five leading LALMs
across four attack scenarios: Audio Interference Attack, Instruction Following
Attack, Context Injection Attack, and Judgment Hijacking Attack. Using metrics
like Defense Success Rate, Context Robustness Score, and Judgment Robustness
Index, their vulnerabilities and resilience were quantitatively assessed.
Experimental results reveal significant performance disparities among models;
no single model consistently outperforms others across all attack types. The
position of malicious content critically influences attack effectiveness,
particularly when placed at the beginning of sequences. A negative correlation
between instruction-following capability and robustness suggests models
adhering strictly to instructions may be more susceptible, contrasting with
greater resistance by safety-aligned models. Additionally, system prompts show
mixed effectiveness, indicating the need for tailored strategies. This work
introduces a benchmark framework and highlights the importance of integrating
robustness into training pipelines. Findings emphasize developing multi-modal
defenses and architectural designs that decouple capability from susceptibility
for secure LALMs deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize smart home
assistants by enhancing their ability to accurately understand user needs and
respond appropriately, which is extremely beneficial for building a smarter
home environment. While recent studies have explored integrating LLMs into
smart home systems, they primarily focus on handling straightforward, valid
single-device operation instructions. However, real-world scenarios are far
more complex and often involve users issuing invalid instructions or
controlling multiple devices simultaneously. These have two main challenges:
LLMs must accurately identify and rectify errors in user instructions and
execute multiple user instructions perfectly. To address these challenges and
advance the development of LLM-based smart home assistants, we introduce
HomeBench, the first smart home dataset with valid and invalid instructions
across single and multiple devices in this paper. We have experimental results
on 13 distinct LLMs; e.g., GPT-4o achieves only a 0.0% success rate in the
scenario of invalid multi-device instructions, revealing that the existing
state-of-the-art LLMs still cannot perform well in this situation even with the
help of in-context learning, retrieval-augmented generation, and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LLMs在分词任务中表现出潜力，LLACA方法为无监督分词提供了新思路。

Abstract: Word segmentation stands as a cornerstone of Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Based on the concept of "comprehend first, segment later", we propose a
new framework to explore the limit of unsupervised word segmentation with Large
Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the semantic understanding capabilities of
LLMs based on word segmentation. We employ current mainstream LLMs to perform
word segmentation across multiple languages to assess LLMs' "comprehension".
Our findings reveal that LLMs are capable of following simple prompts to
segment raw text into words. There is a trend suggesting that models with more
parameters tend to perform better on multiple languages. Additionally, we
introduce a novel unsupervised method, termed LLACA ($\textbf{L}$arge
$\textbf{L}$anguage Model-Inspired $\textbf{A}$ho-$\textbf{C}$orasick
$\textbf{A}$utomaton). Leveraging the advanced pattern recognition capabilities
of Aho-Corasick automata, LLACA innovatively combines these with the deep
insights of well-pretrained LLMs. This approach not only enables the
construction of a dynamic $n$-gram model that adjusts based on contextual
information but also integrates the nuanced understanding of LLMs, offering
significant improvements over traditional methods. Our source code is available

Abstract: Legal consultation is essential for safeguarding individual rights and

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward scalable, low-cost

designed to evaluate and improve LLMs' legal consultation capability. With
LeCoDe, we innovatively collect live-streamed consultations from short-video

rigorous annotation by legal experts further enhances the dataset with
professional insights and expertise. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
evaluation framework that assesses LLMs' consultation capabilities in terms of
(1) clarification capability and (2) professional advice quality. This unified
framework incorporates 12 metrics across two dimensions. Through extensive
experiments on various general and domain-specific LLMs, our results reveal
significant challenges in this task, with even state-of-the-art models like
GPT-4 achieving only 39.8% recall for clarification and 59% overall score for
advice quality, highlighting the complexity of professional consultation
scenarios. Based on these findings, we further explore several strategies to

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have extended the capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) by enabling audio-based human interactions. However,
recent research has revealed that LALMs remain vulnerable to harmful queries
due to insufficient safety-alignment. Despite advances in defence measures for
text and vision LLMs, effective safety-alignment strategies and audio-safety
dataset specifically targeting LALMs are notably absent. Meanwhile defence
measures based on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) struggle to address safety
improvement while avoiding over-rejection issues, significantly compromising
helpfulness. In this work, we propose an unsupervised safety-fine-tuning
strategy as remedy that reshapes model's representation space to enhance
existing LALMs safety-alignment while balancing the risk of over-rejection. Our
experiments, conducted across three generations of Qwen LALMs, demonstrate that
our approach significantly improves LALMs safety under three modality input
conditions (audio-text, text-only, and audio-only) while increasing
over-rejection rate by only 0.88% on average. Warning: this paper contains

Abstract: As the impact of large language models increases, understanding the moral
values they reflect becomes ever more important. Assessing the nature of moral
values as understood by these models via direct prompting is challenging due to
potential leakage of human norms into model training data, and their
sensitivity to prompt formulation. Instead, we propose to use word
associations, which have been shown to reflect moral reasoning in humans, as
low-level underlying representations to obtain a more robust picture of LLMs'
moral reasoning. We study moral differences in associations from western
English-speaking communities and LLMs trained predominantly on English data.
First, we create a large dataset of LLM-generated word associations, resembling
an existing data set of human word associations. Next, we propose a novel
method to propagate moral values based on seed words derived from Moral
Foundation Theory through the human and LLM-generated association graphs.
Finally, we compare the resulting moral conceptualizations, highlighting
detailed but systematic differences between moral values emerging from English
speakers and LLM associations.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations, where
generated responses seem semantically plausible yet exhibit little or no
relevance to the input image. Previous studies reveal that this issue primarily
stems from LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors while disregarding the
visual information during decoding. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a
novel Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (C-PMI) calibrated decoding
strategy, which adaptively strengthens the mutual dependency between generated
texts and input images to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing methods
solely focusing on text token sampling, we propose to jointly model the
contributions of visual and textual tokens to C-PMI, formulating hallucination
mitigation as a bi-level optimization problem aimed at maximizing mutual
information. To solve it, we design a token purification mechanism that
dynamically regulates the decoding process by sampling text tokens remaining
maximally relevant to the given image, while simultaneously refining image
tokens most pertinent to the generated response. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks reveal that the proposed method significantly reduces
hallucinations in LVLMs while preserving decoding efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in Spoken Language Understanding
(SLU). Recent SLU models process audio directly by adapting speech input into
LLMs for better multimodal learning. A key consideration for these models is
the cross-modal alignment between text and audio modalities, which is a
telltale sign as to whether or not LLM is able to associate semantic meaning to
audio segments. While various methods exist for fusing these modalities, there
is no standard metric to evaluate alignment quality in LLMs. In this work, we
propose a new metric, ALAS (Automatic Latent Alignment Score). Our study
examines the correlation between audio and text representations across
transformer layers, for two different tasks (Spoken Question Answering and
Emotion Recognition). We showcase that our metric behaves as expected across
different layers and different tasks.

*Alkis Koudounas,Moreno La Quatra,Elena Baralis*

Main category: cs.CL

Relevance: 75.0

TL;DR: DeepDialogue是一个大规模多模态对话数据集，包含40,150个高质量多轮对话，覆盖41个领域和20种情感，并首次加入语音组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话数据集在情感范围、领域多样性和多轮深度方面有限，且多为纯文本，阻碍了多模态对话系统的发展。

Method: 使用9种不同规模的语言模型生成初始对话，结合人工标注和LLM质量过滤，最终合成情感一致的语音。

Result: 发现小模型在6轮对话后失去连贯性，具体领域对话更有意义，跨模型交互更连贯。

Conclusion: DeepDialogue为多模态对话研究提供了首个大规模开源数据集，保留了情感上下文。

Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in single-turn responses, yet multi-turn dialogues remain
challenging for even the most sophisticated language models. Current dialogue
datasets are limited in their emotional range, domain diversity, turn depth,
and are predominantly text-only, hindering progress in developing more
human-like conversational systems across modalities. To address these
limitations, we present DeepDialogue, a large-scale multimodal dataset
containing 40,150 high-quality multi-turn dialogues spanning 41 domains and
incorporating 20 distinct emotions with coherent emotional progressions. Our
approach pairs 9 different language models (4B-72B parameters) to generate
65,600 initial conversations, which we then evaluate through a combination of
human annotation and LLM-based quality filtering. The resulting dataset reveals
fundamental insights: smaller models fail to maintain coherence beyond 6
dialogue turns; concrete domains (e.g., "cars," "travel") yield more meaningful
conversations than abstract ones (e.g., "philosophy"); and cross-model
interactions produce more coherent dialogues than same-model conversations. A
key contribution of DeepDialogue is its speech component, where we synthesize
emotion-consistent voices for all 40,150 dialogues, creating the first
large-scale open-source multimodal dialogue dataset that faithfully preserves
emotional context across multi-turn conversations.

TL;DR: MA-RAG是一个多智能体框架，用于检索增强生成（RAG），通过协作的智能体解决复杂信息检索任务中的模糊性和推理挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RAG方法依赖于端到端微调或孤立组件增强，无法有效处理模糊查询、稀疏证据或多源信息整合问题。MA-RAG旨在通过多智能体协作解决这些问题。

Method: MA-RAG采用Planner、Step Definer、Extractor和QA Agents等专用智能体，通过任务感知推理分解问题为子任务（如查询消歧、证据提取和答案合成），并利用链式思维提示逐步优化检索与合成过程。

Result: 实验表明，MA-RAG在多跳和模糊QA基准测试中优于无需训练的基线方法，并与微调系统媲美。

Conclusion: MA-RAG通过协作智能体驱动的推理，实现了鲁棒且可解释的结果，证明了其在RAG任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We present MA-RAG, a Multi-Agent framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) that addresses the inherent ambiguities and reasoning challenges in
complex information-seeking tasks. Unlike conventional RAG methods that rely on
either end-to-end fine-tuning or isolated component enhancements, MA-RAG
orchestrates a collaborative set of specialized AI agents: Planner, Step
Definer, Extractor, and QA Agents, to tackle each stage of the RAG pipeline
with task-aware reasoning. Ambiguities may arise from underspecified queries,
sparse or indirect evidence in retrieved documents, or the need to integrate
information scattered across multiple sources. MA-RAG mitigates these
challenges by decomposing the problem into subtasks, such as query
disambiguation, evidence extraction, and answer synthesis, and dispatching them
to dedicated agents equipped with chain-of-thought prompting. These agents
communicate intermediate reasoning and progressively refine the retrieval and
synthesis process. Our design allows fine-grained control over information flow
without any model fine-tuning. Crucially, agents are invoked on demand,
enabling a dynamic and efficient workflow that avoids unnecessary computation.
This modular and reasoning-driven architecture enables MA-RAG to deliver
robust, interpretable results. Experiments on multi-hop and ambiguous QA
benchmarks demonstrate that MA-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art training-free
baselines and rivals fine-tuned systems, validating the effectiveness of
collaborative agent-based reasoning in RAG.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为视觉抽象思维（VAT）的新范式，通过减少冗余视觉信息，提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉推理能力。实验表明，VAT在多种任务中平均提升17%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在面对复杂信息时会使用抽象思维简化内容，受此启发，研究旨在通过视觉抽象提升MLLMs的推理效率。

Method: 提出VAT范式，用视觉抽象替代冗长的中间步骤或外部知识，简化推理过程。

Result: VAT在多种视觉推理任务中平均提升17%的性能，且与CoT兼容。

Conclusion: VAT通过模拟人类抽象思维，有效提升MLLMs的视觉推理能力，为多模态推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Images usually convey richer detail than text, but often include redundant
information which potentially downgrades multimodal reasoning performance. When
faced with lengthy or complex messages, humans tend to employ abstract thinking
to convert them into simple and concise abstracts. Inspired by this cognitive
strategy, we introduce Visual Abstract Thinking (VAT), a novel thinking
paradigm that prompts Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with visual
abstract instead of explicit verbal thoughts or elaborate guidance, permitting
a more concentrated visual reasoning mechanism. Explicit thinking, such as
Chain-of-thought (CoT) or tool-augmented approaches, increases the complexity
of reasoning process via inserting verbose intermediate steps, external
knowledge or visual information. In contrast, VAT reduces redundant visual
information and encourages models to focus their reasoning on more essential
visual elements. Experimental results show that VAT consistently empowers
different models, and achieves an average gain of 17% over GPT-4o baseline by
employing diverse types of visual abstracts, demonstrating that VAT can enhance
visual reasoning abilities for MLLMs regarding conceptual, structural and
relational reasoning tasks. VAT is also compatible with CoT in
knowledge-intensive multimodal reasoning tasks. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of visual reasoning via abstract thinking and encourage further
exploration of more diverse reasoning paradigms from the perspective of human
cognition.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了后处理对LLM在FIM代码生成中自动评估的重要性，发现监督微调显著提升性能，但后处理在随机代码片段生成中仍必要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在FIM代码生成中常产生无关代码，后处理对自动评估至关重要，但确定最佳截断策略复杂。

Method: 研究监督微调对LLM输出的影响，并在HumanEval Infilling和SAFIM基准上评估微调后的Qwen2.5-Coder模型。

Result: 监督微调显著提升FIM代码生成性能，尤其在生成完整代码行时无需后处理；随机代码片段生成仍需后处理。

Conclusion: 监督微调可减少后处理需求，但在某些情况下后处理仍不可或缺。

Abstract: Post-processing is crucial for the automatic evaluation of LLMs in
fill-in-the-middle (FIM) code generation due to the frequent presence of
extraneous code in raw outputs. This extraneous generation suggests a lack of
awareness regarding output boundaries, requiring truncation for effective
evaluation. The determination of an optimal truncation strategy, however, often
proves intricate, particularly when the scope includes several programming
languages. This study investigates the necessity of post-processing
instruction-tuned LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that supervised fine-tuning
significantly enhances FIM code generation, enabling LLMs to generate code that
seamlessly integrates with the surrounding context. Evaluating our fine-tuned
\texttt{Qwen2.5-Coder} (base and instruct) models on HumanEval Infilling and
SAFIM benchmarks demonstrates improved performances without post-processing,
especially when the \emph{middle} consist of complete lines. However,
post-processing of the LLM outputs remains necessary when the \emph{middle} is
a random span of code.

Conclusion: 结论是提出TaMAS策略，倡导根据任务特性选择模型，而非盲目依赖LLM。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of LLMs has overshadowed the potential advantages of
traditional BERT-like models in text classification. This study challenges the
prevailing "LLM-centric" trend by systematically comparing three category
methods, i.e., BERT-like models fine-tuning, LLM internal state utilization,
and zero-shot inference across six high-difficulty datasets. Our findings
reveal that BERT-like models often outperform LLMs. We further categorize
datasets into three types, perform PCA and probing experiments, and identify
task-specific model strengths: BERT-like models excel in pattern-driven tasks,
while LLMs dominate those requiring deep semantics or world knowledge. Based on
this, we propose TaMAS, a fine-grained task selection strategy, advocating for
a nuanced, task-driven approach over a one-size-fits-all reliance on LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法简单、成本低且可扩展，显著提升了Text-to-SQL的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into executable SQL
queries, and recent progress with large language models (LLMs) has driven
substantial improvements in this task. Schema linking remains a critical
component in Text-to-SQL systems, reducing prompt size for models with narrow
context windows and sharpening model focus even when the entire schema fits. We
present a zero-shot, training-free schema linking approach that first
constructs a schema graph based on foreign key relations, then uses a single
prompt to Gemini 2.5 Flash to extract source and destination tables from the
user query, followed by applying classical path-finding algorithms and
post-processing to identify the optimal sequence of tables and columns that
should be joined, enabling the LLM to generate more accurate SQL queries.
Despite being simple, cost-effective, and highly scalable, our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the BIRD benchmark, outperforming previous
specialized, fine-tuned, and complex multi-step LLM-based approaches. We
conduct detailed ablation studies to examine the precision-recall trade-off in
our framework. Additionally, we evaluate the execution accuracy of our schema
filtering method compared to other approaches across various model sizes.

Method: 将命令行构建建模为马尔可夫决策过程，利用上下文无关语法屏蔽无效参数，结合随机和PPO优化采样策略生成数据集。

Result: 语法屏蔽和PPO显著提升样本效率，生成更高质量数据集。微调CodeT5后，BLEU-4提升85%（语法约束）和额外26%（PPO）。

Conclusion: ShIOEnv和生成的数据集为未来研究提供了工具，尤其在小型模型的行为建模和优化方面。

Abstract: Command-line interfaces (CLIs) provide structured textual environments for
system administration. Explorations have been performed using pre-trained
language models (PLMs) to simulate these environments for safe interaction in
high-risk environments. However, their use has been constrained to frozen,
large parameter models like GPT. For smaller architectures to reach a similar
level of believability, a rich dataset of CLI interactions is required.
Existing public datasets focus on mapping natural-language tasks to commands,
omitting crucial execution data such as exit codes, outputs, and environmental
side effects, limiting their usability for behavioral modeling. We introduce a
Shell Input -Output Environment (ShIOEnv), which casts command construction as
a Markov Decision Process whose state is the partially built sequence and whose
actions append arguments. After each action, ShIOEnv executes the candidate and
returns its exit status, output, and progress toward a minimal-length
behavioral objective. Due to the intractable nature of the combinatorial
argument state-action space, we derive a context-free grammar from man pages to
mask invalid arguments from being emitted. We explore random and
proximal-policy optimization (PPO)-optimized sampling of unrestricted and
grammar-masked action spaces to produce four exploration strategies. We
observed that grammar masking and PPO significantly improve sample efficiency
to produce a higher quality dataset (maximizing the number of arguments while
minimizing redundancies). Policy-generated datasets of shell input-output
behavior pairs are used to fine-tune CodeT5, where we observe 85% improvements
in BLEU-4 when constraining the action space to grammar productions with an
additional 26% improvement when applying PPO. The ShIOEnv environment and
curated command behavior datasets are released for use in future research.

Conclusion: 联邦RAG为隐私敏感领域的NLP提供了有前景的解决方案，但仍需解决隐私保护检索、跨客户端异构性等挑战。

Abstract: Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Federated RAG) combines Federated

accuracy of language models by grounding outputs in external knowledge. As
large language models are increasingly deployed in privacy-sensitive domains
such as healthcare, finance, and personalized assistance, Federated RAG offers
a promising framework for secure, knowledge-intensive natural language
processing (NLP). To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first
systematic mapping study of Federated RAG, covering literature published
between 2020 and 2025. Following Kitchenham's guidelines for evidence-based
software engineering, we develop a structured classification of research
focuses, contribution types, and application domains. We analyze architectural
patterns, temporal trends, and key challenges, including privacy-preserving
retrieval, cross-client heterogeneity, and evaluation limitations. Our findings
synthesize a rapidly evolving body of research, identify recurring design
patterns, and surface open questions, providing a foundation for future work at
the intersection of RAG and federated systems.

Abstract: As online platforms grow, comment sections increasingly host harassment that
undermines user experience and well-being. This study benchmarks three leading
large language models, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Anthropic
Claude 3 Opus, on a corpus of 5,080 YouTube comments sampled from high-abuse
threads in gaming, lifestyle, food vlog, and music channels. The dataset
comprises 1,334 harmful and 3,746 non-harmful messages in English, Arabic, and
Indonesian, annotated independently by two reviewers with substantial agreement
(Cohen's kappa = 0.83). Using a unified prompt and deterministic settings,
GPT-4.1 achieved the best overall balance with an F1 score of 0.863, precision
of 0.887, and recall of 0.841. Gemini flagged the highest share of harmful
posts (recall = 0.875) but its precision fell to 0.767 due to frequent false
positives. Claude delivered the highest precision at 0.920 and the lowest
false-positive rate of 0.022, yet its recall dropped to 0.720. Qualitative
analysis showed that all three models struggle with sarcasm, coded insults, and
mixed-language slang. These results underscore the need for moderation
pipelines that combine complementary models, incorporate conversational
context, and fine-tune for under-represented languages and implicit abuse. A
de-identified version of the dataset and full prompts is publicly released to
promote reproducibility and further progress in automated content moderation.

Conclusion: ReadBench揭示了VLMs在处理视觉呈现的广泛文本内容时需要改进，这对实际应用至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have greatly
enhanced their capability to jointly process text and images. However, despite
extensive benchmarks evaluating visual comprehension (e.g., diagrams, color
schemes, OCR tasks...), there is limited assessment of VLMs' ability to read
and reason about text-rich images effectively. To fill this gap, we introduce
ReadBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reading
comprehension capabilities of VLMs. ReadBench transposes contexts from
established text-only benchmarks into images of text while keeping textual
prompts and questions intact. Evaluating leading VLMs with ReadBench, we find
minimal-but-present performance degradation on short, text-image inputs, while
performance sharply declines for longer, multi-page contexts. Our experiments
further reveal that text resolution has negligible effects on multimodal
performance. These findings highlight needed improvements in VLMs, particularly
their reasoning over visually presented extensive textual content, a capability
critical for practical applications. ReadBench is available at

Conclusion: SpeakStream为流式LLM输出的对话AI提供了高效低延迟的TTS解决方案。

Abstract: The latency bottleneck of traditional text-to-speech (TTS) systems
fundamentally hinders the potential of streaming large language models (LLMs)
in conversational AI. These TTS systems, typically trained and inferenced on
complete utterances, introduce unacceptable delays, even with optimized
inference speeds, when coupled with streaming LLM outputs. This is particularly
problematic for creating responsive conversational agents where low first-token
latency is critical. In this paper, we present SpeakStream, a streaming TTS
system that generates audio incrementally from streaming text using a
decoder-only architecture. SpeakStream is trained using a next-step prediction
loss on interleaved text-speech data. During inference, it generates speech
incrementally while absorbing streaming input text, making it particularly
suitable for cascaded conversational AI agents where an LLM streams text to a
TTS system. Our experiments demonstrate that SpeakStream achieves
state-of-the-art latency results in terms of first-token latency while
maintaining the quality of non-streaming TTS systems.

Abstract: The detection of mental health problems from social media and the
interpretation of these results have been extensively explored. Research has
shown that incorporating clinical symptom information into a model enhances
domain expertise, improving its detection and interpretation performance. While
large language models (LLMs) are shown to be effective for generating
explanatory rationales in mental health detection, their substantially large
parameter size and high computational cost limit their practicality. Reasoning
distillation transfers this ability to smaller language models (SLMs), but
inconsistencies in the relevance and domain alignment of LLM-generated
rationales pose a challenge. This paper investigates how rationale quality
impacts SLM performance in mental health detection and explanation generation.
We hypothesize that ensuring high-quality and domain-relevant rationales
enhances the distillation. To this end, we propose a framework that selects
rationales based on their alignment with expert clinical reasoning. Experiments
show that our quality-focused approach significantly enhances SLM performance
in both mental disorder detection and rationale generation. This work
highlights the importance of rationale quality and offers an insightful
framework for knowledge transfer in mental health applications.

Abstract: Limited access to mental healthcare, extended wait times, and increasing
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led individuals to turn to
LLMs for fulfilling their mental health needs. However, examining the
multi-turn mental health conversation capabilities of LLMs remains
under-explored. Existing evaluation frameworks typically focus on diagnostic
accuracy and win-rates and often overlook alignment with patient-specific
goals, values, and personalities required for meaningful conversations. To
address this, we introduce MedAgent, a novel framework for synthetically
generating realistic, multi-turn mental health sensemaking conversations and
use it to create the Mental Health Sensemaking Dialogue (MHSD) dataset,
comprising over 2,200 patient-LLM conversations. Additionally, we present
MultiSenseEval, a holistic framework to evaluate the multi-turn conversation
abilities of LLMs in healthcare settings using human-centric criteria. Our
findings reveal that frontier reasoning models yield below-par performance for
patient-centric communication and struggle at advanced diagnostic capabilities
with average score of 31%. Additionally, we observed variation in model
performance based on patient's persona and performance drop with increasing
turns in the conversation. Our work provides a comprehensive synthetic data
generation framework, a dataset and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in
multi-turn mental health conversations.

Result: 实验表明，OmniCharacter在内容和风格上优于现有RPA和语音-语言模型，延迟低至289ms。

Conclusion: OmniCharacter为沉浸式交互提供了有效的语音-语言解决方案。

Abstract: Role-Playing Agents (RPAs), benefiting from large language models, is an
emerging interactive AI system that simulates roles or characters with diverse
personalities. However, existing methods primarily focus on mimicking dialogues
among roles in textual form, neglecting the role's voice traits (e.g., voice
style and emotions) as playing a crucial effect in interaction, which tends to
be more immersive experiences in realistic scenarios. Towards this goal, we
propose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction
model to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter
enables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and
vocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and
language responses. To align the model with speech-language scenarios, we
construct a dataset named OmniCharacter-10K, which involves more distinctive
characters (20), richly contextualized multi-round dialogue (10K), and dynamic
speech response (135K). Experimental results showcase that our method yields
better responses in terms of both content and style compared to existing RPAs
and mainstream speech-language models, with a response latency as low as 289ms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型（SLLM）依赖监督微调，但标注数据不足导致泛化能力差。

Method: 采用多任务行为模仿（MTBI）方法，通过语音-文本交错训练，确保模型对语音和文本生成等效响应。

Result: MTBI在提示和任务泛化上优于现有SLLM，且所需监督数据更少。

Conclusion: MTBI是一种高效且泛化能力强的语音大语言模型训练方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable generalization across
tasks, leading to increased interest in integrating speech with LLMs. These
speech LLMs (SLLMs) typically use supervised fine-tuning to align speech with
text-based LLMs. However, the lack of annotated speech data across a wide range
of tasks hinders alignment efficiency, resulting in poor generalization. To
address these issues, we propose a novel multi-task 'behavior imitation' method
with speech-text interleaving, called MTBI, which relies solely on paired
speech and transcripts. By ensuring the LLM decoder generates equivalent
responses to paired speech and text, we achieve a more generalized SLLM.
Interleaving is used to further enhance alignment efficiency. We introduce a
simple benchmark to evaluate prompt and task generalization across different
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our MTBI outperforms SOTA SLLMs
on both prompt and task generalization, while requiring less supervised speech
data.

Abstract: We introduce Speech-IFeval, an evaluation framework designed to assess
instruction-following capabilities and quantify catastrophic forgetting in
speech-aware language models (SLMs). Recent SLMs integrate speech perception
with large language models (LLMs), often degrading textual capabilities due to
speech-centric training. Existing benchmarks conflate speech perception with
instruction-following, hindering evaluation of these distinct skills. To
address this gap, we provide a benchmark for diagnosing the
instruction-following abilities of SLMs. Our findings show that most SLMs
struggle with even basic instructions, performing far worse than text-based
LLMs. Additionally, these models are highly sensitive to prompt variations,
often yielding inconsistent and unreliable outputs. We highlight core
challenges and provide insights to guide future research, emphasizing the need
for evaluation beyond task-level metrics.

Abstract: We introduce DanmakuTPPBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to advance
multi-modal Temporal Point Process (TPP) modeling in the era of Large Language
Models (LLMs). While TPPs have been widely studied for modeling temporal event
sequences, existing datasets are predominantly unimodal, hindering progress in
models that require joint reasoning over temporal, textual, and visual
information. To address this gap, DanmakuTPPBench comprises two complementary
components: (1) DanmakuTPP-Events, a novel dataset derived from the Bilibili
video platform, where user-generated bullet comments (Danmaku) naturally form
multi-modal events annotated with precise timestamps, rich textual content, and
corresponding video frames; (2) DanmakuTPP-QA, a challenging question-answering
dataset constructed via a novel multi-agent pipeline powered by
state-of-the-art LLMs and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), targeting complex
temporal-textual-visual reasoning. We conduct extensive evaluations using both
classical TPP models and recent MLLMs, revealing significant performance gaps
and limitations in current methods' ability to model multi-modal event
dynamics. Our benchmark establishes strong baselines and calls for further
integration of TPP modeling into the multi-modal language modeling landscape.

Abstract: Clarifying the research framing of NLP artefacts (e.g., models, datasets,
etc.) is crucial to aligning research with practical applications. Recent
studies manually analyzed NLP research across domains, showing that few papers
explicitly identify key stakeholders, intended uses, or appropriate contexts.
In this work, we propose to automate this analysis, developing a
three-component system that infers research framings by first extracting key
elements (means, ends, stakeholders), then linking them through interpretable
rules and contextual reasoning. We evaluate our approach on two domains:
automated fact-checking using an existing dataset, and hate speech detection
for which we annotate a new dataset-achieving consistent improvements over
strong LLM baselines. Finally, we apply our system to recent automated
fact-checking papers and uncover three notable trends: a rise in vague or
underspecified research goals, increased emphasis on scientific exploration
over application, and a shift toward supporting human fact-checkers rather than
pursuing full automation.

fine-tuning, making them impractical for non-technical users and small
organizations. To address this gap, we propose Tulun, a versatile solution for
terminology-aware translation, combining neural MT with large language model

memories. Our open-source web-based platform enables users to easily create,
edit, and leverage terminology resources, fostering a collaborative
human-machine translation process that respects and incorporates domain
expertise while increasing MT accuracy. Evaluations show effectiveness in both
real-world and benchmark scenarios: on medical and disaster relief translation
tasks for Tetun and Bislama, our system achieves improvements of 16.90-22.41
ChrF++ points over baseline MT systems. Across six low-resource languages on

Abstract: Machine learning models for text classification are trained to predict a
class for a given text. To do this, training and validation samples must be
prepared: a set of texts is collected, and each text is assigned a class. These
classes are usually assigned by human annotators with different expertise
levels, depending on the specific classification task. Collecting such samples
from scratch is labor-intensive because it requires finding specialists and
compensating them for their work; moreover, the number of available specialists
is limited, and their productivity is constrained by human factors. While it
may not be too resource-intensive to collect samples once, the ongoing need to
retrain models (especially in incremental learning pipelines) to address data
drift (also called model drift) makes the data collection process crucial and
costly over the model's entire lifecycle. This paper proposes several
approaches to replace human annotators with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
test classifier predictions for correctness, helping ensure model quality and
support high-quality incremental learning.

Motivation: 少样本提示在有限标注数据下实现高效推理，但其性能依赖于示例选择的质量。HED-LM通过结合数值相似性和上下文相关性解决这一问题。

Method: HED-LM采用混合选择流程，先基于欧氏距离过滤候选示例，再用LLMs评分重新排序。在疲劳检测任务中验证其有效性。

Result: HED-LM的平均宏F1得分为69.13±10.71%，优于随机选择（59.30±10.13%）和仅距离过滤（67.61±11.39%）。

Conclusion: HED-LM通过结合数值相似性和上下文相关性，提高了少样本提示的鲁棒性，适用于医疗监测、人类活动识别和工业安全等场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot optimization with HED-LM (Hybrid
Euclidean Distance with Large Language Models) to improve example selection for
sensor-based classification tasks. While few-shot prompting enables efficient
inference with limited labeled data, its performance largely depends on the
quality of selected examples. HED-LM addresses this challenge through a hybrid
selection pipeline that filters candidate examples based on Euclidean distance
and re-ranks them using contextual relevance scored by large language models
(LLMs). To validate its effectiveness, we apply HED-LM to a fatigue detection
task using accelerometer data characterized by overlapping patterns and high
inter-subject variability. Unlike simpler tasks such as activity recognition,
fatigue detection demands more nuanced example selection due to subtle
differences in physiological signals. Our experiments show that HED-LM achieves
a mean macro F1-score of 69.13$\pm$10.71%, outperforming both random selection
(59.30$\pm$10.13%) and distance-only filtering (67.61$\pm$11.39%). These
represent relative improvements of 16.6% and 2.3%, respectively. The results
confirm that combining numerical similarity with contextual relevance improves
the robustness of few-shot prompting. Overall, HED-LM offers a practical
solution to improve performance in real-world sensor-based learning tasks and
shows potential for broader applications in healthcare monitoring, human
activity recognition, and industrial safety scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce the Exemplar-Based Expository Text Generation task, aiming to

Imitation and present a novel Recurrent Plan-then-Adapt (RePA) framework. RePA
leverages large language models (LLMs) for effective adaptive imitation through
a fine-grained plan-then-adapt process. RePA also enables recurrent
segment-by-segment imitation, supported by two memory structures that enhance
input clarity and output coherence. We also develop task-specific evaluation
metrics--imitativeness, adaptiveness, and adaptive-imitativeness--using LLMs as
evaluators. Experimental results across our collected three diverse datasets
demonstrate that RePA surpasses existing baselines in producing factual,
consistent, and relevant texts for this task.

Abstract: Lay paraphrasing aims to make scientific information accessible to audiences

dynamically generates and applies weights for each LoRA, enabling it to adjust
the impact of different domains based on the input text, without requiring
explicit domain labels. To balance domain-specific knowledge and generalization
across various domains, Sci-LoRA integrates information at both the data and
model levels. This dynamic fusion enhances the adaptability and performance
across various domains. Experimental results across twelve domains on five

large language models and demonstrates flexible generalization and adaptability

LLM agents in diverse professional settings. CRMArena-Pro expands on CRMArena
with nineteen expert-validated tasks across sales, service, and 'configure,
price, and quote' processes, for both Business-to-Business and
Business-to-Customer scenarios. It distinctively incorporates multi-turn
interactions guided by diverse personas and robust confidentiality awareness
assessments. Experiments reveal leading LLM agents achieve only around 58%
single-turn success on CRMArena-Pro, with performance dropping significantly to
approximately 35% in multi-turn settings. While Workflow Execution proves more
tractable for top agents (over 83% single-turn success), other evaluated
business skills present greater challenges. Furthermore, agents exhibit
near-zero inherent confidentiality awareness; though targeted prompting can
improve this, it often compromises task performance. These findings highlight a

Abstract: Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) methods focus on tasks
that demand reasoning with information extending beyond the explicit content
depicted in the image. Early methods relied on explicit knowledge bases to
provide this auxiliary information. Recent approaches leverage Large Language
Models (LLMs) as implicit knowledge sources. While KB-VQA methods have
demonstrated promising results, their potential remains constrained as the
auxiliary text provided may not be relevant to the question context, and may
also include irrelevant information that could misguide the answer predictor.
We introduce a novel four-stage framework called Grounding Caption-Guided
Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (GC-KBVQA), which enables LLMs to
effectively perform zero-shot VQA tasks without the need for end-to-end
multimodal training. Innovations include grounding question-aware caption
generation to move beyond generic descriptions and have compact, yet detailed
and context-rich information. This is combined with knowledge from external
sources to create highly informative prompts for the LLM. GC-KBVQA can address
a variety of VQA tasks, and does not require task-specific fine-tuning, thus
reducing both costs and deployment complexity by leveraging general-purpose,
pre-trained LLMs. Comparison with competing KB-VQA methods shows significantly

Conclusion: 该研究为构建高效紧凑的语言模型提供了指导，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) have gained substantial attention due to their
ability to execute diverse language tasks successfully while using fewer
computer resources. These models are particularly ideal for deployment in
limited environments, such as mobile devices, on-device processing, and edge
systems. In this study, we present a complete assessment of SLMs, focussing on
their design frameworks, training approaches, and techniques for lowering model
size and complexity. We offer a novel classification system to organize the
optimization approaches applied for SLMs, encompassing strategies like pruning,
quantization, and model compression. Furthermore, we assemble SLM's studies of
evaluation suite with some existing datasets, establishing a rigorous platform
for measuring SLM capabilities. Alongside this, we discuss the important
difficulties that remain unresolved in this sector, including trade-offs
between efficiency and performance, and we suggest directions for future study.
We anticipate this study to serve as a beneficial guide for researchers and
practitioners who aim to construct compact, efficient, and high-performing
language models.

Motivation: 现有医学RAG系统主要依赖医学知识库，忽略了类似病例的经验知识，而这是人类临床推理的关键。

Method: 1. 为查询和知识源分配概念标签；2. 混合检索机制结合相关知识和患者病例；3. 集成Med-TextGrad模块，确保输出符合检索内容和查询。

Result: 在多语言、多任务数据集上，DoctorRAG显著优于基线模型，并通过迭代优化进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: DoctorRAG生成更准确、相关和全面的响应，迈向更接近医生推理的医学系统。

Abstract: Existing medical RAG systems mainly leverage knowledge from medical knowledge
bases, neglecting the crucial role of experiential knowledge derived from
similar patient cases -- a key component of human clinical reasoning. To bridge
this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like
reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit
case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first
allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a
hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In
addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is
integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge
and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask
datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline
RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach
generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step
towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.

Result: 实验表明语音模型中存在语义对齐，且早期退出的方法在低资源语言中提高了语音识别的准确性。

Conclusion: 语音基础模型中的跨语言对齐不仅依赖语音相似性，还包括语义知识，这一发现可应用于低资源语言的语音识别改进。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment in pretrained language models (LMs) has enabled
efficient transfer in text-based LMs. Such an alignment has also been observed
in speech foundation models. However, it remains an open question whether
findings and methods from text-based cross-lingual alignment apply to speech.
Building on prior work on spoken translation retrieval, we perform
pronunciation-controlled experiments to observe if cross-lingual alignment can
indeed occur in such models on a semantic basis, instead of relying on phonetic
similarities. Our findings indicate that even in the absence of phonetic cues,
spoken translation retrieval accuracy remains relatively stable. We follow up
with a controlled experiment on a word-level dataset of cross-lingual synonyms
and near-homophones, confirming the existence of both phonetic and semantic
knowledge in the encoder. Finally, we qualitatively examine the transcriptions
produced by early exiting the encoder, where we observe that speech translation
produces semantic errors that are characterized by phonetic similarities to
corresponding words in the source language. We apply this insight from early
exiting to speech recognition in seven low-resource languages unsupported by
the Whisper model, and achieve improved accuracy in all languages examined,
particularly for languages with transparent orthographies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIMT任务在跨语言信息获取和文档理解中至关重要，但现有方法多为多阶段级联，且大语言模型的强化学习应用尚未充分探索。

Method: MT$^{3}$采用多任务强化学习，优化文本识别、上下文推理和翻译三个子任务，并使用混合奖励机制提供细粒度反馈。

Result: MT$^{3}$-7B-Zero在MIT-10M基准上表现优异，超越多个强基线模型，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多任务协同、强化学习初始化、课程设计和奖励机制是推动MLLM驱动TIMT的关键因素。

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT)-the task of translating textual content
embedded in images-is critical for applications in accessibility, cross-lingual
information access, and real-world document understanding. However, TIMT
remains a complex challenge due to the need for accurate optical character
recognition (OCR), robust visual-text reasoning, and high-quality translation,
often requiring cascading multi-stage pipelines. Recent advances in large-scale
Reinforcement Learning (RL) have improved reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), but their application to end-to-end TIMT is
still underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT$^{3}$, the first
framework to apply Multi-Task RL to MLLMs for end-to-end TIMT. MT$^{3}$ adopts
a multi-task optimization paradigm targeting three key sub-skills: text
recognition, context-aware reasoning, and translation. It is trained using a
novel multi-mixed reward mechanism that adapts rule-based RL strategies to
TIMT's intricacies, offering fine-grained, non-binary feedback across tasks.
Furthermore, to facilitate the evaluation of TIMT in authentic cross-cultural
and real-world social media contexts, we introduced XHSPost, the first social
media TIMT benchmark. Our MT$^{3}$-7B-Zero achieves state-of-the-art results on
the latest in-domain MIT-10M benchmark, outperforming strong baselines such as
Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B by notable margins across multiple metrics.
Additionally, the model shows strong generalization to out-of-distribution
language pairs and datasets. In-depth analyses reveal how multi-task synergy,
reinforcement learning initialization, curriculum design, and reward
formulation contribute to advancing MLLM-driven TIMT.

Conclusion: RPDR框架在生物医学实体链接中表现出优越性和泛化能力，解决了闭源LLM的高成本和稳定性问题。

Abstract: Biomedical entity linking aims to map nonstandard entities to standard
entities in a knowledge base. Traditional supervised methods perform well but
require extensive annotated data to transfer, limiting their usage in
low-resource scenarios. Large language models (LLMs), especially closed-source
LLMs, can address these but risk stability issues and high economic costs:
using these models is restricted by commercial companies and brings significant
economic costs when dealing with large amounts of data. To address this, we
propose ``RPDR'', a framework combining closed-source LLMs and open-source LLMs
for re-ranking candidates retrieved by a retriever fine-tuned with a small
amount of data. By prompting a closed-source LLM to generate training data from
unannotated data and fine-tuning an open-source LLM for re-ranking, we
effectively distill the knowledge to the open-source LLM that can be deployed
locally, thus avoiding the stability issues and the problem of high economic
costs. We evaluate RPDR on two datasets, including one real-world dataset and
one publicly available dataset involving two languages: Chinese and English.
RPDR achieves 0.019 Acc@1 improvement and 0.036 Acc@1 improvement on the Aier
dataset and the Ask A Patient dataset when the amount of training data is not
enough. The results demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the
proposed framework.

Abstract: Real-world multimodal misinformation often arises from mixed forgery sources,
requiring dynamic reasoning and adaptive verification. However, existing
methods mainly rely on static pipelines and limited tool usage, limiting their
ability to handle such complexity and diversity. To address this challenge, we
propose T2Agent, a novel misinformation detection agent that incorporates an
extensible toolkit with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The toolkit consists of
modular tools such as web search, forgery detection, and consistency analysis.
Each tool is described using standardized templates, enabling seamless
integration and future expansion. To avoid inefficiency from using all tools
simultaneously, a Bayesian optimization-based selector is proposed to identify
a task-relevant subset. This subset then serves as the action space for MCTS to
dynamically collect evidence and perform multi-source verification. To better
align MCTS with the multi-source nature of misinformation detection, T2Agent
extends traditional MCTS with multi-source verification, which decomposes the
task into coordinated subtasks targeting different forgery sources. A dual
reward mechanism containing a reasoning trajectory score and a confidence score
is further proposed to encourage a balance between exploration across mixed
forgery sources and exploitation for more reliable evidence. We conduct
ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of the tree search mechanism and
tool usage. Extensive experiments further show that T2Agent consistently
outperforms existing baselines on challenging mixed-source multimodal
misinformation benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential as a
training-free approach for enhancing detection accuracy. The code will be
released.

Conclusion: Compliance-to-Code填补了中文金融法规数据集的空白，FinCheck为自动化合规提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Nowadays, regulatory compliance has become a cornerstone of corporate
governance, ensuring adherence to systematic legal frameworks. At its core,
financial regulations often comprise highly intricate provisions, layered
logical structures, and numerous exceptions, which inevitably result in
labor-intensive or comprehension challenges. To mitigate this, recent
Regulatory Technology (RegTech) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained
significant attention in automating the conversion of regulatory text into
executable compliance logic. However, their performance remains suboptimal
particularly when applied to Chinese-language financial regulations, due to
three key limitations: (1) incomplete domain-specific knowledge representation,
(2) insufficient hierarchical reasoning capabilities, and (3) failure to
maintain temporal and logical coherence. One promising solution is to develop a
domain specific and code-oriented datasets for model training. Existing
datasets such as LexGLUE, LegalBench, and CODE-ACCORD are often
English-focused, domain-mismatched, or lack fine-grained granularity for
compliance code generation. To fill these gaps, we present Compliance-to-Code,
the first large-scale Chinese dataset dedicated to financial regulatory
compliance. Covering 1,159 annotated clauses from 361 regulations across ten
categories, each clause is modularly structured with four logical
elements-subject, condition, constraint, and contextual information-along with
regulation relations. We provide deterministic Python code mappings, detailed
code reasoning, and code explanations to facilitate automated auditing. To
demonstrate utility, we present FinCheck: a pipeline for regulation
structuring, code generation, and report generation.

Abstract: Researchers working on low-resource languages face persistent challenges due

Although most large language models (LLMs) are predominantly trained in

African languages, requires specialized techniques. Several strategies have
emerged for adapting models to low-resource languages in todays LLM landscape,
defined by multi-stage pre-training and post-training paradigms. However, the
most effective approaches remain uncertain. This work systematically
investigates which adaptation strategies yield the best performance when
extending existing LLMs to African languages. We conduct extensive experiments

Abstract: Climate change adaptation requires the understanding of disruptive weather

climate-related events stored in regional newspapers record how communities
adapted and recovered from disasters. However, the processing of the original
corpus is non-trivial. In this study, we first develop a disruptive weather
impact dataset with a four-stage well-crafted construction pipeline. Then, we
propose WXImpactBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the capacity of LLMs
on disruptive weather impacts. The benchmark involves two evaluation tasks,
multi-label classification and ranking-based question answering. Extensive
experiments on evaluating a set of LLMs provide first-hand analysis of the
challenges in developing disruptive weather impact understanding and climate
change adaptation systems. The constructed dataset and the code for the
evaluation framework are available to help society protect against

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LALMs缺乏识别知识边界的能力，且可靠性研究不足。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究了训练无关方法（如MCoT）和训练相关方法（如SFT），并提出了新评估指标RGI。

Result: 两种方法均能不同程度提升LALMs的可靠性，且可靠性意识是一种可跨音频模态迁移的“元能力”。

Conclusion: 研究为LALMs的可靠性提供了系统方法和评估标准，并揭示了可靠性意识的跨模态特性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large audio language models (LALMs) have demonstrated
impressive results and promising prospects in universal understanding and
reasoning across speech, music, and general sound. However, these models still
lack the ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries and refuse to answer
questions they don't know proactively. While there have been successful
attempts to enhance the reliability of LLMs, reliable LALMs remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate various approaches
towards reliable LALMs, including training-free methods such as multi-modal
chain-of-thought (MCoT), and training-based methods such as supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Besides, we identify the limitations of previous evaluation
metrics and propose a new metric, the Reliability Gain Index (RGI), to assess
the effectiveness of different reliable methods. Our findings suggest that both
training-free and training-based methods enhance the reliability of LALMs to
different extents. Moreover, we find that awareness of reliability is a "meta
ability", which can be transferred across different audio modalities, although
significant structural and content differences exist among sound, music, and
speech.

TL;DR: ODIN是一个NL2SQL推荐引擎，通过生成多个可能的SQL查询来解决模式歧义问题，动态调整建议数量并学习用户反馈，显著提高了正确查询的生成概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中复杂模式导致的模式歧义是NL2SQL系统的主要挑战，现有LLM方法难以处理。

Method: 引入ODIN，生成多个潜在SQL查询以应对歧义，动态调整建议数量，并通过用户反馈个性化推荐。

Result: ODIN比基线方法提高了1.5-2倍的正确SQL查询生成概率。

Conclusion: ODIN通过处理模式歧义和用户反馈，显著提升了NL2SQL系统的实用性。

Abstract: NL2SQL (natural language to SQL) systems translate natural language into SQL
queries, allowing users with no technical background to interact with databases
and create tools like reports or visualizations. While recent advancements in
large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved NL2SQL accuracy,
schema ambiguity remains a major challenge in enterprise environments with
complex schemas, where multiple tables and columns with semantically similar
names often co-exist. To address schema ambiguity, we introduce ODIN, a NL2SQL
recommendation engine. Instead of producing a single SQL query given a natural
language question, ODIN generates a set of potential SQL queries by accounting
for different interpretations of ambiguous schema components. ODIN dynamically
adjusts the number of suggestions based on the level of ambiguity, and ODIN
learns from user feedback to personalize future SQL query recommendations. Our
evaluation shows that ODIN improves the likelihood of generating the correct
SQL query by 1.5-2$\times$ compared to baselines.

Abstract: Time plays a critical role in how information is generated, retrieved, and
interpreted. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of Temporal
Information Retrieval and Temporal Question Answering, two research areas aimed
at handling and understanding time-sensitive information. As the amount of
time-stamped content from sources like news articles, web archives, and
knowledge bases increases, systems must address challenges such as detecting
temporal intent, normalizing time expressions, ordering events, and reasoning
over evolving or ambiguous facts. These challenges are critical across many
dynamic and time-sensitive domains, from news and encyclopedias to science,
history, and social media. We review both traditional approaches and modern
neural methods, including those that use transformer models and Large Language
Models (LLMs). We also review recent advances in temporal language modeling,
multi-hop reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), alongside
benchmark datasets and evaluation strategies that test temporal robustness,

different degrees of metric-specific perturbations and use them to fine-tune
LLMs. This reference-free evaluation technique does not require ground truth
presentations during inference. Our extensive automated and human experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation approach outperforms classical heuristic-based

Motivation: 传统跨提示AES方法需要联合训练所有源提示数据，导致隐私问题和性能不佳。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 在LLMs上的实验表明，该方法性能优于联合训练，鲁棒性更强，且在严重分布偏移下表现优异。

Conclusion: PIM方法在跨提示AES中高效且隐私友好，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in cross-prompt automated essay scoring (AES) typically train
models jointly on all source prompts, often requiring additional access to
unlabeled target prompt essays simultaneously. However, using all sources is
suboptimal in our pilot study, and re-accessing source datasets during
adaptation raises privacy concerns. We propose a source-free adaptation
approach that selectively merges individually trained source models' parameters
instead of datasets. In particular, we simulate joint training through linear
combinations of task vectors -- the parameter updates from fine-tuning. To
optimize the combination's coefficients, we propose Prior-encoded Information
Maximization (PIM), an unsupervised objective which promotes the model's score
discriminability regularized by priors pre-computed from the sources. We employ
Bayesian optimization as an efficient optimizer of PIM. Experimental results
with LLMs on in-dataset and cross-dataset adaptation show that our method (1)
consistently outperforms training jointly on all sources, (2) maintains
superior robustness compared to other merging methods, (3) excels under severe
distribution shifts where recent leading cross-prompt methods struggle, all
while retaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 该生成模型为词嵌入的线性类比结构提供了理论支持，并揭示了其鲁棒性和普适性。

Abstract: Models such as Word2Vec and GloVe construct word embeddings based on the
co-occurrence probability $P(i,j)$ of words $i$ and $j$ in text corpora. The
resulting vectors $W_i$ not only group semantically similar words but also
exhibit a striking linear analogy structure -- for example, $W_{\text{king}} -
W_{\text{man}} + W_{\text{woman}} \approx W_{\text{queen}}$ -- whose
theoretical origin remains unclear. Previous observations indicate that this
analogy structure: (i) already emerges in the top eigenvectors of the matrix
$M(i,j) = P(i,j)/P(i)P(j)$, (ii) strengthens and then saturates as more
eigenvectors of $M (i, j)$, which controls the dimension of the embeddings, are
included, (iii) is enhanced when using $\log M(i,j)$ rather than $M(i,j)$, and
(iv) persists even when all word pairs involved in a specific analogy relation
(e.g., king-queen, man-woman) are removed from the corpus. To explain these
phenomena, we introduce a theoretical generative model in which words are
defined by binary semantic attributes, and co-occurrence probabilities are
derived from attribute-based interactions. This model analytically reproduces
the emergence of linear analogy structure and naturally accounts for properties
(i)-(iv). It can be viewed as giving fine-grained resolution into the role of
each additional embedding dimension. It is robust to various forms of noise and
agrees well with co-occurrence statistics measured on Wikipedia and the analogy
benchmark introduced by Mikolov et al.

individuals and society, exacerbating confusion and increasing hesitancy in
adopting recommended health measures. Recent advancements in generative AI,
capable of producing realistic, human like text and images, have significantly
accelerated the spread and expanded the reach of health misinformation,
resulting in an alarming surge in its dissemination. To combat the infodemics,
most existing work has focused on developing misinformation datasets from
social media and fact checking platforms, but has faced limitations in topical
coverage, inclusion of AI generation, and accessibility of raw content. To
address these issues, we present MM Health, a large scale multimodal
misinformation dataset in the health domain consisting of 34,746 news article
encompassing both textual and visual information. MM Health includes
human-generated multimodal information (5,776 articles) and AI generated
multimodal information (28,880 articles) from various SOTA generative AI
models. Additionally, We benchmarked our dataset against three tasks
(reliability checks, originality checks, and fine-grained AI detection)
demonstrating that existing SOTA models struggle to accurately distinguish the
reliability and origin of information. Our dataset aims to support the
development of misinformation detection across various health scenarios,
facilitating the detection of human and machine generated content at multimodal
levels.

Motivation: 旨在解决不同表述中意见语义表示的差异，提供一个统一的意见概念化框架。

Method: 基于NLP和符号描述，设计UOC本体，提出UOCE任务，并使用生成模型建立基线性能。

Result: 提供了UOCE任务的评估数据集和指标，并展示了生成模型在该任务上的基线性能。

Conclusion: UOC本体和UOCE任务为意见提取提供了统一框架，未来可扩展至更复杂场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Unified Opinion Concepts (UOC) ontology to
integrate opinions within their semantic context. The UOC ontology bridges the
gap between the semantic representation of opinion across different
formulations. It is a unified conceptualisation based on the facets of opinions
studied extensively in NLP and semantic structures described through symbolic
descriptions. We further propose the Unified Opinion Concept Extraction (UOCE)
task of extracting opinions from the text with enhanced expressivity.
Additionally, we provide a manually extended and re-annotated evaluation
dataset for this task and tailored evaluation metrics to assess the adherence
of extracted opinions to UOC semantics. Finally, we establish baseline
performance for the UOCE task using state-of-the-art generative models.

Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL数据集主要关注业务场景和操作逻辑，缺乏对领域知识和复杂数学推理的覆盖。LogicCat旨在填补这一空白，推动推理驱动的Text-to-SQL研究。

Method: 提出了LogicCat数据集，包含4,038个英文问题及其SQL查询，以及12,114个逐步推理注释，覆盖45个不同领域的数据库。

Result: LogicCat显著增加了现有模型的推理难度，最高执行准确率仅为14.96%。加入链式思维注释后，性能提升至33.96%。

Conclusion: LogicCat为推理驱动的Text-to-SQL系统研究提供了新的挑战和机会，推动了该领域的进展。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a fundamental task in natural language processing that seeks
to translate natural language questions into meaningful and executable SQL
queries. While existing datasets are extensive and primarily focus on business
scenarios and operational logic, they frequently lack coverage of
domain-specific knowledge and complex mathematical reasoning. To address this
gap, we present a novel dataset tailored for complex reasoning and
chain-of-thought analysis in SQL inference, encompassing physical, arithmetic,
commonsense, and hypothetical reasoning. The dataset consists of 4,038 English
questions, each paired with a unique SQL query and accompanied by 12,114
step-by-step reasoning annotations, spanning 45 databases across diverse
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LogicCat substantially increases
the difficulty for state-of-the-art models, with the highest execution accuracy
reaching only 14.96%. Incorporating our chain-of-thought annotations boosts
performance to 33.96%. Benchmarking leading public methods on Spider and BIRD
further underscores the unique challenges presented by LogicCat, highlighting
the significant opportunities for advancing research in robust,

Result: 初步评估表明，K-tool能够有效生成主题词汇测试，帮助预测学生对文本的理解能力。

Conclusion: K-tool为教育领域提供了一种自动化工具，用于快速评估学生的背景知识，但其应用目前限于英语母语的中学生。

Abstract: Background knowledge is typically needed for successful comprehension of
topical and domain specific reading passages, such as in the STEM domain.
However, there are few automated measures of student knowledge that can be
readily deployed and scored in time to make predictions on whether a given
student will likely be able to understand a specific content area text. In this
paper, we present our effort in developing K-tool, an automated system for
generating topical vocabulary tests that measure students' background knowledge
related to a specific text. The system automatically detects the topic of a
given text and produces topical vocabulary items based on their relationship
with the topic. This information is used to automatically generate background
knowledge forms that contain words that are highly related to the topic and
words that share similar features but do not share high associations to the
topic. Prior research indicates that performance on such tasks can help
determine whether a student is likely to understand a particular text based on
their knowledge state. The described system is intended for use with middle and
high school student population of native speakers of English. It is designed to
handle single reading passages and is not dependent on any corpus or text
collection. In this paper, we describe the system architecture and present an
initial evaluation of the system outputs.

Abstract: Multi-party Conversational Agents (MPCAs) are systems designed to engage in
dialogue with more than two participants simultaneously. Unlike traditional
two-party agents, designing MPCAs faces additional challenges due to the need
to interpret both utterance semantics and social dynamics. This survey explores
recent progress in MPCAs by addressing three key questions: 1) Can agents model
each participants' mental states? (State of Mind Modeling); 2) Can they
properly understand the dialogue content? (Semantic Understanding); and 3) Can
they reason about and predict future conversation flow? (Agent Action
Modeling). We review methods ranging from classical machine learning to Large
Language Models (LLMs) and multi-modal systems. Our analysis underscores Theory
of Mind (ToM) as essential for building intelligent MPCAs and highlights
multi-modal understanding as a promising yet underexplored direction. Finally,
this survey offers guidance to future researchers on developing more capable

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像、音频和视频生成中表现出色，但在文本生成中面临离散性的挑战。现有方法要么在连续潜在空间中应用高斯扩散（难以解码），要么在分类单纯形空间中操作（忽略语义关系）。

Method: 提出Smoothie方法，基于语义相似性逐步平滑标记嵌入，既保留语义结构又便于解码。

Result: 在多个序列到序列生成任务中，Smoothie在生成质量上优于现有扩散模型，且消融研究表明其扩散空间优于标准嵌入空间和分类单纯形。

Conclusion: Smoothie通过结合连续和离散方法的优势，为文本生成提供了一种有效的扩散方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generating
images, audio, and video, but their adaptation to text remains challenging due
to its discrete nature. Prior approaches either apply Gaussian diffusion in
continuous latent spaces, which inherits semantic structure but struggles with
token decoding, or operate in categorical simplex space, which respect
discreteness but disregard semantic relation between tokens. In this paper, we
propose Smoothing Diffusion on Token Embeddings (Smoothie), a novel diffusion
method that combines the strengths of both approaches by progressively
smoothing token embeddings based on semantic similarity. This technique enables
gradual information removal while maintaining a natural decoding process.
Experimental results on several sequence-to-sequence generation tasks
demonstrate that Smoothie outperforms existing diffusion-based models in
generation quality. Furthermore, ablation studies show that our proposed
diffusion space yields better performance than both the standard embedding
space and the categorical simplex. Our code is available at

Result: 在YAGO3-10上MRR为0.521，Hit@10为0.680，训练时间减少24%，推理延迟降低31%，内存使用减少22%。

Conclusion: RelatE是知识图谱补全中可扩展且可解释的简单架构替代方案。

Abstract: We revisit the efficacy of simple, real-valued embedding models for knowledge
graph completion and introduce RelatE, an interpretable and modular method that
efficiently integrates dual representations for entities and relations. RelatE
employs a real-valued phase-modulus decomposition, leveraging sinusoidal phase
alignments to encode relational patterns such as symmetry, inversion, and
composition. In contrast to recent approaches based on complex-valued
embeddings or deep neural architectures, RelatE preserves architectural
simplicity while achieving competitive or superior performance on standard
benchmarks. Empirically, RelatE outperforms prior methods across several
datasets: on YAGO3-10, it achieves an MRR of 0.521 and Hit@10 of 0.680,
surpassing all baselines. Additionally, RelatE offers significant efficiency
gains, reducing training time by 24%, inference latency by 31%, and peak GPU
memory usage by 22% compared to RotatE. Perturbation studies demonstrate
improved robustness, with MRR degradation reduced by up to 61% relative to
TransE and by up to 19% compared to RotatE under structural edits such as edge
removals and relation swaps. Formal analysis further establishes the model's
full expressiveness and its capacity to represent essential first-order logical
inference patterns. These results position RelatE as a scalable and
interpretable alternative to more complex architectures for knowledge graph
completion.

Conclusion: CrosGrpsABS框架有效解决了低资源语言的ABSA问题，并在高资源语言中表现优异。

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fundamental task in natural
language processing, offering fine-grained insights into opinions expressed in
text. While existing research has largely focused on resource-rich languages
like English which leveraging large annotated datasets, pre-trained models, and
language-specific tools. These resources are often unavailable for low-resource
languages such as Bengali. The ABSA task in Bengali remains poorly explored and
is further complicated by its unique linguistic characteristics and a lack of
annotated data, pre-trained models, and optimized hyperparameters. To address
these challenges, this research propose CrosGrpsABS, a novel hybrid framework
that leverages bidirectional cross-attention between syntactic and semantic
graphs to enhance aspect-level sentiment classification. The CrosGrpsABS
combines transformerbased contextual embeddings with graph convolutional
networks, built upon rule-based syntactic dependency parsing and semantic
similarity computations. By employing bidirectional crossattention, the model
effectively fuses local syntactic structure with global semantic context,
resulting in improved sentiment classification performance across both low- and
high-resource settings. We evaluate CrosGrpsABS on four low-resource Bengali
ABSA datasets and the high-resource English SemEval 2014 Task 4 dataset. The
CrosGrpsABS consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving notable
improvements, including a 0.93% F1-score increase for the Restaurant domain and
a 1.06% gain for the Laptop domain in the SemEval 2014 Task 4 benchmark.

Abstract: Inconsistent political statements represent a form of misinformation. They
erode public trust and pose challenges to accountability, when left unnoticed.
Detecting inconsistencies automatically could support journalists in asking
clarification questions, thereby helping to keep politicians accountable. We
propose the Inconsistency detection task and develop a scale of inconsistency
types to prompt NLP-research in this direction. To provide a resource for
detecting inconsistencies in a political domain, we present a dataset of 698
human-annotated pairs of political statements with explanations of the
annotators' reasoning for 237 samples. The statements mainly come from voting
assistant platforms such as Wahl-O-Mat in Germany and Smartvote in Switzerland,
reflecting real-world political issues. We benchmark Large Language Models
(LLMs) on our dataset and show that in general, they are as good as humans at
detecting inconsistencies, and might be even better than individual humans at
predicting the crowd-annotated ground-truth. However, when it comes to
identifying fine-grained inconsistency types, none of the model have reached
the upper bound of performance (due to natural labeling variation), thus
leaving room for improvement. We make our dataset and code publicly available.

Conclusion: 该方法为社交媒体中的因果分析提供了更准确的工具，尤其在错误信息传播研究中表现突出。

Abstract: Understanding true influence in social media requires distinguishing
correlation from causation--particularly when analyzing misinformation spread.
While existing approaches focus on exposure metrics and network structures,
they often fail to capture the causal mechanisms by which external temporal
signals trigger engagement. We introduce a novel joint treatment-outcome
framework that leverages existing sequential models to simultaneously adapt to
both policy timing and engagement effects. Our approach adapts causal inference
techniques from healthcare to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATE) within
the sequential nature of social media interactions, tackling challenges from
external confounding signals. Through our experiments on real-world
misinformation and disinformation datasets, we show that our models outperform
existing benchmarks by 15--22% in predicting engagement across diverse
counterfactual scenarios, including exposure adjustment, timing shifts, and
varied intervention durations. Case studies on 492 social media users show our
causal effect measure aligns strongly with the gold standard in influence

observe. We develop a computational model that quantifies the explanatory
strength of a (natural language) statement about an agent's beliefs via three
factors: accuracy, informativity, and causal relevance to actions, each of
which can be computed from a probabilistic generative model of belief-driven
behavior. Using this model, we study the role of each factor in how people
selectively attribute beliefs to other agents. We investigate this via an
experiment where participants watch an agent collect keys hidden in boxes in
order to reach a goal, then rank a set of statements describing the agent's
beliefs about the boxes' contents. We find that accuracy and informativity
perform reasonably well at predicting these rankings when combined, but that
causal relevance is the single factor that best explains participants'
responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GSA-TTS是一种逐步风格适配的TTS模型，通过新颖的风格编码器从声学参考中逐步编码说话风格，用于零样本语音合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决零样本语音合成中风格表示的鲁棒性和丰富性问题。

Method: GSA-TTS首先捕捉每个语义声音单元的局部风格，然后通过自注意力机制结合局部风格以获得全局风格条件。

Result: 在未见过的说话者上测试，GSA-TTS在自然度、说话者相似性和可懂度方面表现良好。

Conclusion: GSA-TTS的分层结构提供了可解释性和可控性潜力。

Abstract: We present the gradual style adaptor TTS (GSA-TTS) with a novel style encoder
that gradually encodes speaking styles from an acoustic reference for zero-shot
speech synthesis. GSA first captures the local style of each semantic sound
unit. Then the local styles are combined by self-attention to obtain a global
style condition. This semantic and hierarchical encoding strategy provides a
robust and rich style representation for an acoustic model. We test GSA-TTS on
unseen speakers and obtain promising results regarding naturalness, speaker
similarity, and intelligibility. Additionally, we explore the potential of GSA
in terms of interpretability and controllability, which stems from its
hierarchical structure.

Conclusion: 长形式语音媒体的细粒度信息访问具有挑战性。

Abstract: Podcasts have become daily companions for half a billion users. Given the
enormous amount of podcast content available, highlights provide a valuable
signal that helps viewers get the gist of an episode and decide if they want to
invest in listening to it in its entirety. However, identifying highlights
automatically is challenging due to the unstructured and long-form nature of
the content. We introduce Rhapsody, a dataset of 13K podcast episodes paired
with segment-level highlight scores derived from YouTube's 'most replayed'
feature. We frame the podcast highlight detection as a segment-level binary
classification task. We explore various baseline approaches, including
zero-shot prompting of language models and lightweight finetuned language
models using segment-level classification heads. Our experimental results
indicate that even state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4o and Gemini
struggle with this task, while models finetuned with in-domain data
significantly outperform their zero-shot performance. The finetuned model
benefits from leveraging both speech signal features and transcripts. These
findings highlight the challenges for fine-grained information access in
long-form spoken media.

Abstract: Automatic related work generation (RWG) can save people's time and effort
when writing a draft of related work section (RWS) for further revision.
However, existing methods for RWG always suffer from shallow comprehension due
to taking the limited portions of references papers as input and isolated
explanation for each reference due to ineffective capturing the relationships
among them. To address these issues, we focus on full-text-based RWG task and
propose a novel multi-agent framework. Our framework consists of three agents:
a selector that decides which section of the papers is going to read next, a
reader that digests the selected section and updates a shared working memory,
and a writer that generates RWS based on the final curated memory. To better
capture the relationships among references, we also propose two graph-aware
strategies for selector, enabling to optimize the reading order with constrains
of the graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework
consistently improves performance across three base models and various input
configurations. The graph-aware selectors outperform alternative selectors,
achieving state-of-the-art results. The code and data are available at

Abstract: This paper presents KIT's submissions to the IWSLT 2025 low-resource track.
We develop both cascaded systems, consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) models, and end-to-end (E2E) Speech
Translation (ST) systems for three language pairs: Bemba, North Levantine
Arabic, and Tunisian Arabic into English. Building upon pre-trained models, we
fine-tune our systems with different strategies to utilize resources
efficiently. This study further explores system enhancement with synthetic data
and model regularization. Specifically, we investigate MT-augmented ST by
generating translations from ASR data using MT models. For North Levantine,
which lacks parallel ST training data, a system trained solely on synthetic
data slightly surpasses the cascaded system trained on real data. We also
explore augmentation using text-to-speech models by generating synthetic speech
from MT data, demonstrating the benefits of synthetic data in improving both
ASR and ST performance for Bemba. Additionally, we apply intra-distillation to
enhance model performance. Our experiments show that this approach consistently
improves results across ASR, MT, and ST tasks, as well as across different
pre-trained models. Finally, we apply Minimum Bayes Risk decoding to combine
the cascaded and end-to-end systems, achieving an improvement of approximately
1.5 BLEU points.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs offer an excellent solution for representing the
lexical-semantic structures of lexicographic data. However, working with the
SPARQL query language represents a considerable hurdle for many non-expert
users who could benefit from the advantages of this technology. This paper
addresses the challenge of creating natural language interfaces for
lexicographic data retrieval on knowledge graphs such as Wikidata. We develop a
multidimensional taxonomy capturing the complexity of Wikidata's lexicographic
data ontology module through four dimensions and create a template-based
dataset with over 1.2 million mappings from natural language utterances to
SPARQL queries. Our experiments with GPT-2 (124M), Phi-1.5 (1.3B), and
GPT-3.5-Turbo reveal significant differences in model capabilities. While all
models perform well on familiar patterns, only GPT-3.5-Turbo demonstrates
meaningful generalization capabilities, suggesting that model size and diverse
pre-training are crucial for adaptability in this domain. However, significant
challenges remain in achieving robust generalization, handling diverse
linguistic data, and developing scalable solutions that can accommodate the
full complexity of lexicographic knowledge representation.

regular LoRA and full fine-tuning when the accent is unknown. When the accent
is known, the results further improve. Furthermore, MAS-LoRA shows less

Conclusion: 归一化biaffine评分可显著提高依赖解析效率，减少过参数化。

Abstract: Dependency parsing is the task of inferring natural language structure, often
approached by modeling word interactions via attention through biaffine
scoring. This mechanism works like self-attention in Transformers, where scores
are calculated for every pair of words in a sentence. However, unlike
Transformer attention, biaffine scoring does not use normalization prior to
taking the softmax of the scores. In this paper, we provide theoretical
evidence and empirical results revealing that a lack of normalization
necessarily results in overparameterized parser models, where the extra
parameters compensate for the sharp softmax outputs produced by high variance
inputs to the biaffine scoring function. We argue that biaffine scoring can be
made substantially more efficient by performing score normalization. We conduct
experiments on six datasets for semantic and syntactic dependency parsing using
a one-hop parser. We train N-layer stacked BiLSTMs and evaluate the parser's
performance with and without normalizing biaffine scores. Normalizing allows us
to beat the state of the art on two datasets, with fewer samples and trainable
parameters. Code: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EfficientSDP-70C1

Abstract: Existing Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems primarily focus on
single-session dialogues, limiting their effectiveness in long-term memory
augmentation. To address this challenge, we introduce a MS-TOD dataset, the
first multi-session TOD dataset designed to retain long-term memory across
sessions, enabling fewer turns and more efficient task completion. This defines
a new benchmark task for evaluating long-term memory in multi-session TOD.
Based on this new dataset, we propose a Memory-Active Policy (MAP) that
improves multi-session dialogue efficiency through a two-stage approach. 1)
Memory-Guided Dialogue Planning retrieves intent-aligned history, identifies
key QA units via a memory judger, refines them by removing redundant questions,
and generates responses based on the reconstructed memory. 2) Proactive
Response Strategy detects and correct errors or omissions, ensuring efficient
and accurate task completion. We evaluate MAP on MS-TOD dataset, focusing on
response quality and effectiveness of the proactive strategy. Experiments on
MS-TOD demonstrate that MAP significantly improves task success and turn
efficiency in multi-session scenarios, while maintaining competitive
performance on conventional single-session tasks.

Abstract: Manga, or Japanese comics, is a richly multimodal narrative form that blends
images and text in complex ways. Teaching large multimodal models (LMMs) to
understand such narratives at a human-like level could help manga creators
reflect on and refine their stories. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks
for multimodal manga understanding: MangaOCR, which targets in-page text
recognition, and MangaVQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate contextual
understanding through visual question answering. MangaVQA consists of 526
high-quality, manually constructed question-answer pairs, enabling reliable
evaluation across diverse narrative and visual scenarios. Building on these
benchmarks, we develop MangaLMM, a manga-specialized model finetuned from the
open-source LMM Qwen2.5-VL to jointly handle both tasks. Through extensive
experiments, including comparisons with proprietary models such as GPT-4o and
Gemini 2.5, we assess how well LMMs understand manga. Our benchmark and model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决研究人员在引用文献时的时间消耗问题，提升引用推荐的准确性和生成句子的质量。

Method: 结合引用网络和情感意图提升推荐准确性，利用原文摘要、上下文、引用意图和推荐文献生成句子。

Result: SciRGC提高了引用推荐的准确性和句子的上下文适宜性。

Conclusion: SciRGC为跨学科研究提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Citations are crucial in scientific research articles as they highlight the
connection between the current study and prior work. However, this process is
often time-consuming for researchers. In this study, we propose the SciRGC
framework, which aims to automatically recommend citation articles and generate
citation sentences for citation locations within articles. The framework
addresses two key challenges in academic citation generation: 1) how to
accurately identify the author's citation intent and find relevant citation
papers, and 2) how to generate high-quality citation sentences that align with
human preferences. We enhance citation recommendation accuracy in the citation
article recommendation module by incorporating citation networks and sentiment
intent, and generate reasoning-based citation sentences in the citation
sentence generation module by using the original article abstract, local
context, citation intent, and recommended articles as inputs. Additionally, we
propose a new evaluation metric to fairly assess the quality of generated
citation sentences. Through comparisons with baseline models and ablation
experiments, the SciRGC framework not only improves the accuracy and relevance
of citation recommendations but also ensures the appropriateness of the
generated citation sentences in context, providing a valuable tool for
interdisciplinary researchers.

Abstract: The digital exclusion of endangered languages remains a critical challenge in
NLP, limiting both linguistic research and revitalization efforts. This study
introduces the first computational investigation of Comanche, an Uto-Aztecan
language on the verge of extinction, demonstrating how minimal-cost,
community-informed NLP interventions can support language preservation. We
present a manually curated dataset of 412 phrases, a synthetic data generation
pipeline, and an empirical evaluation of GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini for language
identification. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs struggle with Comanche
in zero-shot settings, few-shot prompting significantly improves performance,
achieving near-perfect accuracy with just five examples. Our findings highlight
the potential of targeted NLP methodologies in low-resource contexts and
emphasize that visibility is the first step toward inclusion. By establishing a
foundation for Comanche in NLP, we advocate for computational approaches that
prioritize accessibility, cultural sensitivity, and community engagement.

Result: 在多个ICD编码基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: GKI-ICD通过综合知识注入有效提升ICD编码任务性能。

Abstract: ICD Coding aims to assign a wide range of medical codes to a medical text
document, which is a popular and challenging task in the healthcare domain. To
alleviate the problems of long-tail distribution and the lack of annotations of
code-specific evidence, many previous works have proposed incorporating code
knowledge to improve coding performance. However, existing methods often focus
on a single type of knowledge and design specialized modules that are complex
and incompatible with each other, thereby limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose GKI-ICD, a novel, general
knowledge injection framework that integrates three key types of knowledge,
namely ICD Description, ICD Synonym, and ICD Hierarchy, without specialized
design of additional modules. The comprehensive utilization of the above
knowledge, which exhibits both differences and complementarity, can effectively
enhance the ICD coding performance. Extensive experiments on existing popular
ICD coding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GKI-ICD, which achieves
the state-of-the-art performance on most evaluation metrics. Code is available

BEADS (Bias Enriched Annotation for Dialogue Structure), which systematically
extends the DAMSL framework to capture bias driven and adversarial discourse
features in political communication. BEADS includes a domain and language
agnostic set of tags that model ideological framing, emotional appeals, and
confrontational tactics. Our methodology compares detailed human annotation
with zero shot ChatGPT assisted tagging on verified transcripts from the Trump

analysis shows that Trump consistently dominated in key categories: Challenge
and Adversarial Exchanges, Selective Emphasis, Appeal to Fear, Political Bias,
and Perceived Dismissiveness. These findings underscore his use of emotionally

Result: AmpleHate在性能上超越对比学习方法82.14%，收敛更快，且注意力模式与人类判断一致。

Conclusion: AmpleHate通过模拟人类推理过程，显著提升了隐式仇恨言论检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech detection is challenging due to its subtlety and
reliance on contextual interpretation rather than explicit offensive words.
Current approaches rely on contrastive learning, which are shown to be
effective on distinguishing hate and non-hate sentences. Humans, however,
detect implicit hate speech by first identifying specific targets within the
text and subsequently interpreting how these target relate to their surrounding
context. Motivated by this reasoning process, we propose AmpleHate, a novel
approach designed to mirror human inference for implicit hate detection.
AmpleHate identifies explicit target using a pretrained Named Entity
Recognition model and capture implicit target information via [CLS] tokens. It
computes attention-based relationships between explicit, implicit targets and
sentence context and then, directly injects these relational vectors into the
final sentence representation. This amplifies the critical signals of
target-context relations for determining implicit hate. Experiments demonstrate
that AmpleHate achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming contrastive
learning baselines by an average of 82.14% and achieve faster convergence.
Qualitative analyses further reveal that attention patterns produced by
AmpleHate closely align with human judgement, underscoring its interpretability
and robustness.

Method: 通过分析频率与排名的双对数图，识别线性分离的编码系统，并比较人类语言与动物通信系统的分布特征。

Result: 人类语言符合最优性类别，表现出Zipf定律；某些动物系统（如海豚和座头鲸）可能符合，但其他系统因指数分布而被排除。

Conclusion: 研究支持Zipf定律源于压缩的假设，为编码系统的最优性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that
class are separated linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law,
namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Whithin that class, Zipf's
law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like
structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All
languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of
the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that
cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution
instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into
plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a
straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under
non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are separated by a
linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under
compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may
indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. Our findings provide
support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression.

Result: 评估15个MLLMs后发现，开源基础模型优于推理变体，闭源模型则相反；视觉输入被遮挡时性能下降。

Conclusion: ReasonMap为视觉推理研究提供了新见解，揭示了开源与闭源模型之间的差距。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
progress in visual tasks, including semantic scene understanding and text-image
alignment, with reasoning variants enhancing performance on complex tasks
involving mathematics and logic. However, their capacity for reasoning tasks
involving fine-grained visual understanding remains insufficiently evaluated.
To address this gap, we introduce ReasonMap, a benchmark designed to assess the
fine-grained visual understanding and spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs.
ReasonMap encompasses high-resolution transit maps from 30 cities across 13
countries and includes 1,008 question-answer pairs spanning two question types
and three templates. Furthermore, we design a two-level evaluation pipeline
that properly assesses answer correctness and quality. Comprehensive
evaluations of 15 popular MLLMs, including both base and reasoning variants,
reveal a counterintuitive pattern: among open-source models, base models
outperform reasoning ones, while the opposite trend is observed in
closed-source models. Additionally, performance generally degrades when visual
inputs are masked, indicating that while MLLMs can leverage prior knowledge to
answer some questions, fine-grained visual reasoning tasks still require
genuine visual perception for strong performance. Our benchmark study offers
new insights into visual reasoning and contributes to investigating the gap
between open-source and closed-source models.

Result: 在视频处理中实现了最高1.94倍的加速，且性能无损失。

Conclusion: StD是一种即插即用的解决方案，适用于视频大语言模型的高效推理。

Abstract: Due to the auto-regressive nature of current video large language models
(Video-LLMs), the inference latency increases as the input sequence length
grows, posing challenges for the efficient processing of video sequences that
are usually very long. We observe that during decoding, the attention scores of
most tokens in Video-LLMs tend to be sparse and concentrated, with only certain
tokens requiring comprehensive full attention. Based on this insight, we
introduce Sparse-to-Dense (StD), a novel decoding strategy that integrates two
distinct modules: one leveraging sparse top-K attention and the other employing
dense full attention. These modules collaborate to accelerate Video-LLMs
without loss. The fast (sparse) model speculatively decodes multiple tokens,
while the slow (dense) model verifies them in parallel. StD is a tuning-free,
plug-and-play solution that achieves up to a 1.94$\times$ walltime speedup in
video processing. It maintains model performance while enabling a seamless
transition from a standard Video-LLM to a sparse Video-LLM with minimal code
modifications.

Conclusion: SATORI通过可验证的分阶段方法显著提升了VQA任务的性能。

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated powerful reasoning capabilities in the text
domain through stable reinforcement learning (RL). Recently, in the multimodal
domain, works have begun to directly apply RL to generate R1-like free-form
reasoning for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. However, multimodal tasks
share an intrinsically different nature from textual tasks, which heavily rely
on the understanding of the input image to solve the problem. Therefore, such
free-form reasoning faces two critical limitations in the VQA task: (1)
Extended reasoning chains diffuse visual focus away from task-critical regions,
degrading answer accuracy. (2) Unverifiable intermediate steps amplify
policy-gradient variance and computational costs overhead. To address these
issues, in this paper, we introduce SATORI ($\textbf{S}patially$
$\textbf{A}nchored$ $\textbf{T}ask$ $\textbf{O}ptimization$ with
$\textbf{R}e\textbf{I}nforcement$ Learning), which decomposes VQA into three
verifiable stages, including global image captioning, region localization, and
answer prediction, each supplying explicit reward signals. Furthermore, we also
introduce VQA-Verify, a 12k dataset annotated with answer-aligned captions and
bounding-boxes to facilitate training. Experiments demonstrate consistent
performance improvements across seven VQA benchmarks, achieving up to $15.7\%$
improvement in accuracy in accuracy compared to the R1-like baseline. Our
analysis of the attention map confirms enhanced focus on critical regions,
which brings improvements in accuracy. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉输入在大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中通常需要更多token，导致计算开销大。现有方法主要关注token重要性，但忽略了多样性和任务相关性。

Method: 设计ToDRE框架，分两阶段压缩token：1）使用贪婪k-center算法选择多样化token；2）在LLM解码器中剔除任务无关token。

Result: ToDRE减少90%视觉token，总推理时间加速2.6倍，保持95.1%模型性能，兼容高效注意力算子。

Conclusion: ToDRE通过多样性和任务相关性优化token压缩，显著提升效率且性能损失小。

Abstract: The representation of visual inputs of large vision-language models (LVLMs)
usually involves substantially more tokens than that of textual inputs, leading
to significant computational overhead. Several recent studies strive to
mitigate this issue by either conducting token compression to prune redundant
visual tokens or guiding them to bypass certain computational stages. While
most existing work exploits token importance as the redundancy indicator, our
study reveals that two largely neglected factors, namely, the diversity of
retained visual tokens and their task relevance, often offer more robust
criteria in token pruning. To this end, we design ToDRE, a two-stage and
training-free token compression framework that achieves superior performance by
pruning Tokens based on token Diversity and token-task RElevance. Instead of
pruning redundant tokens, ToDRE introduces a greedy k-center algorithm to
select and retain a small subset of diverse visual tokens after the vision
encoder. Additionally, ToDRE addresses the "information migration" by further
eliminating task-irrelevant visual tokens within the decoder of large language
model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that ToDRE effectively reduces 90% of
visual tokens after vision encoder and adaptively prunes all visual tokens
within certain LLM's decoder layers, leading to a 2.6x speed-up in total
inference time while maintaining 95.1% of model performance and excellent
compatibility with efficient attention operators.

Motivation: 研究DiT模型中知识的分布，以提升模型的可解释性、可控性和适应性。

Conclusion: 研究为DiT的内部结构提供了新见解，并提出了更高效、可控的模型编辑方法。

Abstract: Understanding how knowledge is distributed across the layers of generative
models is crucial for improving interpretability, controllability, and
adaptation. While prior work has explored knowledge localization in UNet-based
architectures, Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based models remain underexplored in
this context. In this paper, we propose a model- and knowledge-agnostic method
to localize where specific types of knowledge are encoded within the DiT
blocks. We evaluate our method on state-of-the-art DiT-based models, including
PixArt-alpha, FLUX, and SANA, across six diverse knowledge categories. We show
that the identified blocks are both interpretable and causally linked to the
expression of knowledge in generated outputs. Building on these insights, we
apply our localization framework to two key applications: model personalization
and knowledge unlearning. In both settings, our localized fine-tuning approach
enables efficient and targeted updates, reducing computational cost, improving
task-specific performance, and better preserving general model behavior with
minimal interference to unrelated or surrounding content. Overall, our findings
offer new insights into the internal structure of DiTs and introduce a
practical pathway for more interpretable, efficient, and controllable model
editing.

Result: VisCRA在多个主流闭源MLRMs上攻击成功率显著（最高76.48%），验证了视觉推理能力作为攻击载体的风险。

Conclusion: MLRMs的视觉推理能力既是其优势也是安全漏洞，需重新评估其安全设计。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLRMs) has enabled
sophisticated visual reasoning capabilities by integrating reinforcement
learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. However, while these enhanced
reasoning capabilities improve performance, they also introduce new and
underexplored safety risks. In this work, we systematically investigate the
security implications of advanced visual reasoning in MLRMs. Our analysis
reveals a fundamental trade-off: as visual reasoning improves, models become
more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Motivated by this critical finding, we
introduce VisCRA (Visual Chain Reasoning Attack), a novel jailbreak framework
that exploits the visual reasoning chains to bypass safety mechanisms. VisCRA
combines targeted visual attention masking with a two-stage reasoning induction
strategy to precisely control harmful outputs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate VisCRA's significant effectiveness, achieving high attack success
rates on leading closed-source MLRMs: 76.48% on Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking,
68.56% on QvQ-Max, and 56.60% on GPT-4o. Our findings highlight a critical
insight: the very capability that empowers MLRMs -- their visual reasoning --
can also serve as an attack vector, posing significant security risks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have significantly improved textual
reasoning through the effective use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and reinforcement
learning. However, extending these successes to vision-language tasks remains
challenging due to inherent limitations in text-only CoT, such as visual
hallucinations and insufficient multimodal integration. In this paper, we
introduce Point-RFT, a multimodal reasoning framework explicitly designed to
leverage visually grounded CoT reasoning for visual document understanding. Our
approach consists of two stages: First, we conduct format finetuning using a
curated dataset of 71K diverse visual reasoning problems, each annotated with
detailed, step-by-step rationales explicitly grounded to corresponding visual
elements. Second, we employ reinforcement finetuning targeting visual document
understanding. On ChartQA, our approach improves accuracy from 70.88%
(format-finetuned baseline) to 90.04%, surpassing the 83.92% accuracy achieved
by reinforcement finetuning relying solely on text-based CoT. The result shows
that our grounded CoT is more effective for multimodal reasoning compared with
the text-only CoT. Moreover, Point-RFT exhibits superior generalization
capability across several out-of-domain visual document reasoning benchmarks,
including CharXiv, PlotQA, IconQA, TabMWP, etc., and highlights its potential
in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to adapting multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
to new tasks have relied heavily on fine-tuning. This paper introduces
Efficient Multi-Modal Long Context Learning (EMLoC), a novel training-free
alternative that embeds demonstration examples directly into the model input.
EMLoC offers a more efficient, flexible, and scalable solution for task
adaptation. Because extremely lengthy inputs introduce prohibitive
computational and memory overhead, EMLoC contributes a chunk-wise compression
mechanism combined with layer-wise adaptive pruning. It condenses long-context
multimodal inputs into compact, task-specific memory representations. By
adaptively pruning tokens at each layer under a Jensen-Shannon divergence
constraint, our method achieves a dramatic reduction in inference complexity
without sacrificing performance. This approach is the first to seamlessly
integrate compression and pruning techniques for multi-modal long-context
learning, offering a scalable and efficient solution for real-world
applications. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks
demonstrate that EMLoC achieves performance on par with or superior to naive
long-context approaches. Our results highlight the potential of EMLoC as a
groundbreaking framework for efficient and flexible adaptation of multi-modal
models in resource-constrained environments. Codes are publicly available at

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the
emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that unify visual
understanding and image generation within a single framework. However, most
existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent
limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image
generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In
this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing
FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as
an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced
probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond
the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement
with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration
during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we
initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to
the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both
visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as
a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we
show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant
performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement
through reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential for assessing the reliability and
trustworthiness of modern AI systems. Among existing approaches, verbalized
uncertainty, where models express their confidence through natural language,
has emerged as a lightweight and interpretable solution in large language
models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness in vision-language models (VLMs)
remains insufficiently studied. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of verbalized confidence in VLMs, spanning three model categories,
four task domains, and three evaluation scenarios. Our results show that
current VLMs often display notable miscalibration across diverse tasks and
settings. Notably, visual reasoning models (i.e., thinking with images)
consistently exhibit better calibration, suggesting that modality-specific
reasoning is critical for reliable uncertainty estimation. To further address
calibration challenges, we introduce Visual Confidence-Aware Prompting, a
two-stage prompting strategy that improves confidence alignment in multimodal
settings. Overall, our study highlights the inherent miscalibration in VLMs
across modalities. More broadly, our findings underscore the fundamental
importance of modality alignment and model faithfulness in advancing reliable
multimodal systems.

Conclusion: 首次成功将RL应用于大规模全模态推理，为通用基础模型提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Long-horizon video-audio reasoning and fine-grained pixel understanding
impose conflicting requirements on omnimodal models: dense temporal coverage
demands many low-resolution frames, whereas precise grounding calls for
high-resolution inputs. We tackle this trade-off with a two-system
architecture: a Global Reasoning System selects informative keyframes and
rewrites the task at low spatial cost, while a Detail Understanding System
performs pixel-level grounding on the selected high-resolution snippets.
Because ``optimal'' keyframe selection and reformulation are ambiguous and hard
to supervise, we formulate them as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and
present Omni-R1, an end-to-end RL framework built on Group Relative Policy
Optimization. Omni-R1 trains the Global Reasoning System through hierarchical
rewards obtained via online collaboration with the Detail Understanding System,
requiring only one epoch of RL on small task splits.
  Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, namely Referring Audio-Visual
Segmentation (RefAVS) and Reasoning Video Object Segmentation (REVOS), show
that Omni-R1 not only surpasses strong supervised baselines but also
outperforms specialized state-of-the-art models, while substantially improving
out-of-domain generalization and mitigating multimodal hallucination. Our

Conclusion: 未来感知注意力家族在保持自回归结构的同时，显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Causal attention has become a foundational mechanism in autoregressive
vision-language models (VLMs), unifying textual and visual inputs under a
single generative framework. However, existing causal mask-based strategies are
inherited from large language models (LLMs) where they are tailored for
text-only decoding, and their adaptation to vision tokens is insufficiently
addressed in the prefill stage. Strictly masking future positions for vision
queries introduces overly rigid constraints, which hinder the model's ability
to leverage future context that often contains essential semantic cues for
accurate inference. In this work, we empirically investigate how different
causal masking strategies affect vision-language inference and then propose a
family of future-aware attentions tailored for this setting. We first
empirically analyze the effect of previewing future tokens for vision queries
and demonstrate that rigid masking undermines the model's capacity to capture
useful contextual semantic representations. Based on these findings, we propose
a lightweight attention family that aggregates future visual context into past
representations via pooling, effectively preserving the autoregressive
structure while enhancing cross-token dependencies. We evaluate a range of
causal masks across diverse vision-language inference settings and show that
selectively compressing future semantic context into past representations
benefits the inference.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but
suffer from high computational costs due to redundant vision tokens. Existing
pruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and
prune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the
interaction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic
question: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify
redundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant
visual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models
the interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves
between tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information
relay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy
emerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration;
and (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to
contradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an
information-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the
current criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the
model's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves
superior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token
reduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x

Abstract: Benefiting from contrastively trained visual encoders on large-scale natural
scene images, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across various visual perception tasks. However, the inherent
limitations of contrastive learning upon summarized descriptions fundamentally
restrict the capabilities of models in meticulous reasoning, particularly in
crucial scenarios of geometric problem-solving. To enhance geometric
understanding, we propose a novel hard negative contrastive learning framework
for the vision encoder, which combines image-based contrastive learning using
generation-based hard negatives created by perturbing diagram generation code,
and text-based contrastive learning using rule-based negatives derived from
modified geometric descriptions and retrieval-based negatives selected based on
caption similarity. We train CLIP using our strong negative learning method,
namely MMCLIP (Multimodal Math CLIP), and subsequently train an LMM for
geometric problem-solving. Experiments show that our trained model, MMGeoLM,
significantly outperforms other open-source models on three geometric reasoning
benchmarks. Even with a size of 7B, it can rival powerful closed-source models
like GPT-4o. We further study the impact of different negative sample
construction methods and the number of negative samples on the geometric

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in
video understanding tasks. However, they often suffer from heavy computational
overhead due to the large number of visual tokens generated from multiple video
frames. Existing visual token compression methods often rely on attention
scores from language models as guidance. However, these scores exhibit inherent
biases: global bias reflects a tendency to focus on the two ends of the visual
token sequence, while local bias leads to an over-concentration on the same
spatial positions across different frames. To address the issue of attention
bias, we propose $\textbf{A}$ttention-$\textbf{D}$ebi$\textbf{a}$sed
$\textbf{T}$oken $\textbf{P}$runing for Video Large Language Models
($\textbf{AdaTP}$), a novel token pruning pipeline for Video LLMs. AdaTP
integrates two dedicated debiasing modules into the pipeline, targeting global
attention bias and local attention bias, respectively. Without the need for
additional training, our method significantly reduces the computational
overhead of Video LLMs while retaining the performance of vanilla models.
Extensive evaluation shows that AdaTP achieves state-of-the-art performance in
various commonly used video understanding benchmarks. In particular, on
LLaVA-OneVision-7B, AdaTP maintains performance without degradation while using
only up to $27.3\%$ FLOPs compared to the vanilla model. Our code will be

Conclusion: 该方法仅需少量架构调整，即可无缝集成到现有Soft MoE框架中，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising direction for
scaling vision architectures efficiently. Among them, Soft MoE improves
training stability by assigning each token to all experts via continuous
dispatch weights. However, current designs overlook the semantic structure
which is implicitly encoded in these weights, resulting in suboptimal expert
routing. In this paper, we discover that dispatch weights in Soft MoE
inherently exhibit segmentation-like patterns but are not explicitly aligned
with semantic regions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a
foreground-guided enhancement strategy. Specifically, we introduce a spatially
aware auxiliary loss that encourages expert activation to align with semantic
foreground regions. To further reinforce this supervision, we integrate a
lightweight LayerScale mechanism that improves information flow and stabilizes
optimization in skip connections. Our method necessitates only minor
architectural adjustments and can be seamlessly integrated into prevailing Soft
MoE frameworks. Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and multiple
smaller-scale classification benchmarks not only showcase consistent
performance enhancements but also reveal more interpretable expert routing
mechanisms.

Conclusion: SVG2在生成质量和效率之间实现了帕累托最优。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are essential for video generation but suffer
from significant latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention. By
computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs
and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that
existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same
computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token
identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than
semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive
computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones,
leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing
contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework
that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste,
achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and
efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and
reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach
ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification
accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient
computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget
control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x

often struggle with gradient-based strategies prone to local optima and lacking
precise directional guidance, and typically decouple visual and textual
modalities, thereby limiting their effectiveness by neglecting crucial
cross-modal interactions. Inspired by the Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK)
framework, we posit that VLMs encode safety-relevant information within their
internal fusion-layer representations, revealing an implicit safety decision
boundary in the latent space. This motivates exploiting boundary to steer model
behavior. Accordingly, we propose JailBound, a novel latent space jailbreak
framework comprising two stages: (1) Safety Boundary Probing, which addresses
the guidance issue by approximating decision boundary within fusion layer's
latent space, thereby identifying optimal perturbation directions towards the
target region; and (2) Safety Boundary Crossing, which overcomes the
limitations of decoupled approaches by jointly optimizing adversarial
perturbations across both image and text inputs. This latter stage employs an
innovative mechanism to steer the model's internal state towards
policy-violating outputs while maintaining cross-modal semantic consistency.
Extensive experiments on six diverse VLMs demonstrate JailBound's efficacy,
achieves 94.32% white-box and 67.28% black-box attack success averagely, which
are 6.17% and 21.13% higher than SOTA methods, respectively. Our findings
expose a overlooked safety risk in VLMs and highlight the urgent need for more
robust defenses. Warning: This paper contains potentially sensitive, harmful

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TESSER的新型对抗攻击框架，通过特征敏感梯度缩放和频谱平滑正则化提升对抗样本的迁移性，实验表明其在多种架构上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗迁移性是评估深度神经网络鲁棒性的关键挑战，尤其是在安全关键应用中。现有攻击方法在ViT到CNN或混合模型的迁移效果不佳，因此需要更有效的攻击框架。

Method: TESSER结合了特征敏感梯度缩放（FSGS）和频谱平滑正则化（SSR），前者基于特征激活调整梯度，后者通过高斯先验抑制高频噪声。

Result: 在ImageNet的12种架构上，TESSER对CNN的攻击成功率提升10.9%，对ViT提升7.2%，且在防御模型上表现优异（53.55% ASR）。

Conclusion: TESSER通过语义有意义且频谱平滑的扰动，显著提升了对抗攻击的迁移性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial transferability remains a critical challenge in evaluating the
robustness of deep neural networks. In security-critical applications,
transferability enables black-box attacks without access to model internals,
making it a key concern for real-world adversarial threat assessment. While
Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong adversarial performance,
existing attacks often fail to transfer effectively across architectures,
especially from ViTs to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or hybrid models.
In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TESSER} -- a novel adversarial attack
framework that enhances transferability via two key strategies: (1)
\textit{Feature-Sensitive Gradient Scaling (FSGS)}, which modulates gradients
based on token-wise importance derived from intermediate feature activations,
and (2) \textit{Spectral Smoothness Regularization (SSR)}, which suppresses
high-frequency noise in perturbations using a differentiable Gaussian prior.
These components work in tandem to generate perturbations that are both
semantically meaningful and spectrally smooth. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet across 12 diverse architectures demonstrate that TESSER achieves
+10.9\% higher attack succes rate (ASR) on CNNs and +7.2\% on ViTs compared to
the state-of-the-art Adaptive Token Tuning (ATT) method. Moreover, TESSER
significantly improves robustness against defended models, achieving 53.55\%
ASR on adversarially trained CNNs. Qualitative analysis shows strong alignment
between TESSER's perturbations and salient visual regions identified via
Grad-CAM, while frequency-domain analysis reveals a 12\% reduction in
high-frequency energy, confirming the effectiveness of spectral regularization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks.
However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain
limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper,
we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable
deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to
think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an
end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a
Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human
process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly
step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a
dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement
learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly
reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with
limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves
superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on
VAD and VAR tasks. Codes and datasets will be released at

Abstract: Video diffusion models have recently shown promise for world modeling through
autoregressive frame prediction conditioned on actions. However, they struggle
to maintain long-term memory due to the high computational cost associated with
processing extended sequences in attention layers. To overcome this limitation,
we propose a novel architecture leveraging state-space models (SSMs) to extend
temporal memory without compromising computational efficiency. Unlike previous
approaches that retrofit SSMs for non-causal vision tasks, our method fully
exploits the inherent advantages of SSMs in causal sequence modeling. Central
to our design is a block-wise SSM scanning scheme, which strategically trades
off spatial consistency for extended temporal memory, combined with dense local
attention to ensure coherence between consecutive frames. We evaluate the
long-term memory capabilities of our model through spatial retrieval and
reasoning tasks over extended horizons. Experiments on Memory Maze and
Minecraft datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses baselines in
preserving long-range memory, while maintaining practical inference speeds
suitable for interactive applications.

Conclusion: Ground-R1为现有方法提供了可扩展且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive general
capabilities across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. However, the reasoning
processes of LVLMs often suffer from unreliable outputs and limited
interpretability. To address this, grounded visual reasoning has emerged as a
promising paradigm that enforces responses anchored on salient visual evidence
regions. However, existing approaches typically rely on costly supervision such
as bounding box annotations, chain-of-thought rationale or external tool calls,
limiting their scalability. In this work, we propose Ground-R1, a reinforcement
learning framework that enables grounded visual reasoning without requiring
explicit evidence or rationale annotations. Ground-R1 consists of a grounding
phase that generates evidence region rollouts based on format constraints, and
an answering phase that produces responses guided by both answer correctness
and format adherence rewards. Extensive experiments across multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks manifest that Ground-R1 achieves superior performance and
exhibits emergent cognitive behaviors such as uncertainty awareness, spatial
perception, and iterative refinement, offering a scalable and interpretable
alternative to existing approaches.

Result: TNG-CLIP在图像-文本匹配、文本-图像检索和图像生成任务中均达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: TNG-CLIP高效且性能优越，Neg-TtoI为否定理解任务提供了新的评估标准。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong
performance across a range of downstream tasks. However, CLIP is still limited
in negation understanding: the ability to recognize the absence or exclusion of
a concept. Existing methods address the problem by using a large language model
(LLM) to generate large-scale data of image captions containing negation for
further fine-tuning CLIP. However, these methods are both time- and
compute-intensive, and their evaluations are typically restricted to image-text
matching tasks. To expand the horizon, we (1) introduce a training-time
negation data generation pipeline such that negation captions are generated
during the training stage, which only increases 2.5% extra training time, and
(2) we propose the first benchmark, Neg-TtoI, for evaluating text-to-image
generation models on prompts containing negation, assessing model's ability to
produce semantically accurate images. We show that our proposed method,
TNG-CLIP, achieves SOTA performance on diverse negation benchmarks of
image-to-text matching, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation.

Abstract: This work investigates the optimal allocation of inference compute across

typically focuses on optimizing model efficiency or improving performance
without considering resource constraints, we instead identify optimal model
configuration under fixed inference compute budgets. We conduct large-scale
training sweeps and careful parametric modeling of task performance to identify
the inference compute-optimal frontier. Our experiments reveal how task
performance depends on scaling factors and finetuning data size, as well as how
changes in data size shift the compute-optimal frontier. These findings
translate to practical tips for selecting these scaling factors.

Conclusion: 通过系统性增强视觉依赖性，论文提出的方法显著减少了LVLM的幻觉问题，提升了其实际适用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually generate texts which satisfy
context coherence but don't match the visual input. Such a hallucination issue
hinders LVLMs' applicability in the real world. The key to solving
hallucination in LVLM is to make the text generation rely more on the visual
content. Most previous works choose to enhance/adjust the features/output of a
specific modality (i.e., visual or textual) to alleviate hallucinations in
LVLM, which do not explicitly or systematically enhance the visual reliance. In
this paper, we comprehensively investigate the factors which may degenerate the
visual reliance in text generation of LVLM from a Bayesian perspective. Based
on our observations, we propose to mitigate hallucination in LVLM from three
aspects. Firstly, we observe that not all visual tokens are informative in
generating meaningful texts. We propose to evaluate and remove redundant visual
tokens to avoid their disturbance. Secondly, LVLM may encode inappropriate
prior information, making it lean toward generating unexpected words. We
propose a simple yet effective way to rectify the prior from a Bayesian
perspective. Thirdly, we observe that starting from certain steps, the
posterior of next-token prediction conditioned on visual tokens may collapse to
a prior distribution which does not depend on any informative visual tokens at
all. Thus, we propose to stop further text generation to avoid hallucination.
Extensive experiments on three benchmarks including POPE, CHAIR, and MME
demonstrate that our method can consistently mitigate the hallucination issue
of LVLM and performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) has witnessed significant progress in creating
small datasets that encapsulate rich information from large original ones.
Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance,
while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture
generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability
for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real
distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking
concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly
represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the
constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose
incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to
perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation.
Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on
category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object
details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly
enhances both the controllability and interpretability of the distilled image
generation, without relying on pre-trained classifiers. We demonstrate the
efficacy of CONCORD by achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K
and its subsets. The code implementation is released in

Abstract: Reasoning Video Object Segmentation is a challenging task, which generates a
mask sequence from an input video and an implicit, complex text query. Existing
works probe into the problem by finetuning Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLM) for segmentation-based output, while still falling short in difficult
cases on videos given temporally-sensitive queries, primarily due to the
failure to integrate temporal and spatial information. In this paper, we
propose ThinkVideo, a novel framework which leverages the zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capability of MLLM to address these challenges.
Specifically, ThinkVideo utilizes the CoT prompts to extract object
selectivities associated with particular keyframes, then bridging the reasoning
image segmentation model and SAM2 video processor to output mask sequences. The
ThinkVideo framework is training-free and compatible with closed-source MLLMs,
which can be applied to Reasoning Video Instance Segmentation. We further
extend the framework for online video streams, where the CoT is used to update
the object of interest when a better target starts to emerge and becomes
visible. We conduct extensive experiments on video object segmentation with
explicit and implicit queries. The results show that ThinkVideo significantly
outperforms previous works in both cases, qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: 当前最佳MLLM准确率仅48.14%，远低于人类水平的98.40%。

Conclusion: SpatialMQA揭示了MLLMs在空间关系推理上的不足，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Spatial relation reasoning is a crucial task for multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) to understand the objective world. However, current benchmarks
have issues like relying on bounding boxes, ignoring perspective substitutions,
or allowing questions to be answered using only the model's prior knowledge
without image understanding. To address these issues, we introduce SpatialMQA,
a human-annotated spatial relation reasoning benchmark based on COCO2017, which
enables MLLMs to focus more on understanding images in the objective world. To
ensure data quality, we design a well-tailored annotation procedure, resulting
in SpatialMQA consisting of 5,392 samples. Based on this benchmark, a series of
closed- and open-source MLLMs are implemented and the results indicate that the
current state-of-the-art MLLM achieves only 48.14% accuracy, far below the
human-level accuracy of 98.40%. Extensive experimental analyses are also
conducted, suggesting the future research directions. The benchmark and codes
are available at https://github.com/ziyan-xiaoyu/SpatialMQA.git.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在RL驱动的优化中仅提供单次延迟奖励，导致训练效率低下，无法精确评估每一步去噪动作的贡献。

Method: 提出了一种信用分配框架，通过跟踪中间图像与最终图像的余弦相似度变化，动态分配密集奖励。

Result: 方法在四种人类偏好奖励函数上实现了1.25到2倍的样本效率提升，且不损害原始最优策略。

Conclusion: 该方法通过奖励塑形显著提升了训练效率和图像质量，无需额外辅助网络。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model fine-tuning leverage
reinforcement learning (RL) to align generated images with learnable reward
functions. The existing approaches reformulate denoising as a Markov decision
process for RL-driven optimization. However, they suffer from reward sparsity,
receiving only a single delayed reward per generated trajectory. This flaw
hinders precise step-level attribution of denoising actions, undermines
training efficiency. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective credit
assignment framework that dynamically distributes dense rewards across
denoising steps. Specifically, we track changes in cosine similarity between
intermediate and final images to quantify each step's contribution on
progressively reducing the distance to the final image. Our approach avoids
additional auxiliary neural networks for step-level preference modeling and
instead uses reward shaping to highlight denoising phases that have a greater
impact on image quality. Our method achieves 1.25 to 2 times higher sample
efficiency and better generalization across four human preference reward
functions, without compromising the original optimal policy.

Result: VMA在多种场景和数据集中表现出高效性和通用性，可用于攻击和版权保护。

Conclusion: VMA揭示了VLMs的安全漏洞，同时展示了其在版权保护中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
understanding complex real-world scenarios and supporting data-driven
decision-making processes. However, VLMs exhibit significant vulnerability
against adversarial examples, either text or image, which can lead to various
adversarial outcomes, e.g., jailbreaking, hijacking, and hallucination, etc. In
this work, we empirically and theoretically demonstrate that VLMs are
particularly susceptible to image-based adversarial examples, where
imperceptible perturbations can precisely manipulate each output token. To this
end, we propose a novel attack called Vision-language model Manipulation Attack
(VMA), which integrates first-order and second-order momentum optimization
techniques with a differentiable transformation mechanism to effectively
optimize the adversarial perturbation. Notably, VMA can be a double-edged
sword: it can be leveraged to implement various attacks, such as jailbreaking,
hijacking, privacy breaches, Denial-of-Service, and the generation of sponge
examples, etc, while simultaneously enabling the injection of watermarks for
copyright protection. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy
and generalizability of VMA across diverse scenarios and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的自回归模型在视觉生成中通常基于单尺度密集图像标记，无法充分利用全局上下文，尤其是在早期标记预测时。Hi-MAR旨在通过分层建模解决这一问题。

Method: Hi-MAR采用多阶段自回归建模，首先生成低分辨率图像标记作为全局结构的中介，随后利用这些标记指导高分辨率标记的生成。此外，引入扩散Transformer头增强全局上下文。

Result: 在类别条件和文本到图像生成任务中，Hi-MAR优于典型自回归基线，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Hi-MAR通过分层建模和全局上下文增强，显著提升了自回归模型的视觉生成能力。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful generative paradigm for
visual generation. The current de-facto standard of next token prediction
commonly operates over a single-scale sequence of dense image tokens, and is
incapable of utilizing global context especially for early tokens prediction.
In this paper, we introduce a new autoregressive design to model a hierarchy
from a few low-resolution image tokens to the typical dense image tokens, and
delve into a thorough hierarchical dependency across multi-scale image tokens.
Technically, we present a Hierarchical Masked Autoregressive models (Hi-MAR)
that pivot on low-resolution image tokens to trigger hierarchical
autoregressive modeling in a multi-phase manner. Hi-MAR learns to predict a few
image tokens in low resolution, functioning as intermediary pivots to reflect
global structure, in the first phase. Such pivots act as the additional
guidance to strengthen the next autoregressive modeling phase by shaping global
structural awareness of typical dense image tokens. A new Diffusion Transformer
head is further devised to amplify the global context among all tokens for mask
token prediction. Extensive evaluations on both class-conditional and
text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that Hi-MAR outperforms typical AR
baselines, while requiring fewer computational costs. Code is available at

Conclusion: VisTA展示了增强泛化能力和自适应利用多样化工具的潜力，为灵活、经验驱动的视觉推理系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: We introduce VisTA, a new reinforcement learning framework that empowers
visual agents to dynamically explore, select, and combine tools from a diverse
library based on empirical performance. Existing methods for tool-augmented
reasoning either rely on training-free prompting or large-scale fine-tuning;
both lack active tool exploration and typically assume limited tool diversity,
and fine-tuning methods additionally demand extensive human supervision. In
contrast, VisTA leverages end-to-end reinforcement learning to iteratively
refine sophisticated, query-specific tool selection strategies, using task
outcomes as feedback signals. Through Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), our framework enables an agent to autonomously discover effective
tool-selection pathways without requiring explicit reasoning supervision.
Experiments on the ChartQA, Geometry3K, and BlindTest benchmarks demonstrate
that VisTA achieves substantial performance gains over training-free baselines,
especially on out-of-distribution examples. These results highlight VisTA's
ability to enhance generalization, adaptively utilize diverse tools, and pave
the way for flexible, experience-driven visual reasoning systems.

Motivation: Spiking Transformers在能效上有优势，但性能低于传统神经网络。作者发现高频信号损失是性能下降的主要原因，并提出解决方案。

Method: 引入Max-Former，通过Max-Pooling和Depth-Wise Convolution增强高频信号。

Result: Max-Former在ImageNet上达到82.39%的准确率，显著优于Spikformer。

Conclusion: 高频信号恢复是提升Spiking Transformers性能的关键，未来研究应关注其独特性质。

Abstract: Spiking Transformers offer an energy-efficient alternative to conventional
deep learning by transmitting information solely through binary (0/1) spikes.
However, there remains a substantial performance gap compared to artificial
neural networks. A common belief is that their binary and sparse activation
transmission leads to information loss, thus degrading feature representation
and accuracy. In this work, however, we reveal for the first time that spiking
neurons preferentially propagate low-frequency information. We hypothesize that
the rapid dissipation of high-frequency components is the primary cause of
performance degradation. For example, on Cifar-100, adopting Avg-Pooling
(low-pass) for token mixing lowers performance to 76.73%; interestingly,
replacing it with Max-Pooling (high-pass) pushes the top-1 accuracy to 79.12%,
surpassing the well-tuned Spikformer baseline by 0.97%. Accordingly, we
introduce Max-Former that restores high-frequency signals through two
frequency-enhancing operators: extra Max-Pooling in patch embedding and
Depth-Wise Convolution in place of self-attention. Notably, our Max-Former
(63.99 M) hits the top-1 accuracy of 82.39% on ImageNet, showing a +7.58%
improvement over Spikformer with comparable model size (74.81%, 66.34 M). We
hope this simple yet effective solution inspires future research to explore the
distinctive nature of spiking neural networks, beyond the established practice
in standard deep learning.

Motivation: 现代应用可轻松访问用户相册，VLM能从图像集中推断隐私属性，但缺乏多图像标注的基准数据集和当前多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在抽象属性推断上的局限性阻碍了研究。

Result: HolmesEye在平均准确率上比现有基线提高10.8%，抽象属性预测超过人类水平15.0%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了图像隐私分析的紧迫性，提供了新数据集和框架指导未来研究。

Abstract: Our research reveals a new privacy risk associated with the vision-language
model (VLM) agentic framework: the ability to infer sensitive attributes (e.g.,
age and health information) and even abstract ones (e.g., personality and
social traits) from a set of personal images, which we term "image private
attribute profiling." This threat is particularly severe given that modern apps
can easily access users' photo albums, and inference from image sets enables
models to exploit inter-image relations for more sophisticated profiling.
However, two main challenges hinder our understanding of how well VLMs can
profile an individual from a few personal photos: (1) the lack of benchmark
datasets with multi-image annotations for private attributes, and (2) the
limited ability of current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to infer
abstract attributes from large image collections. In this work, we construct
PAPI, the largest dataset for studying private attribute profiling in personal
images, comprising 2,510 images from 251 individuals with 3,012 annotated
privacy attributes. We also propose HolmesEye, a hybrid agentic framework that
combines VLMs and LLMs to enhance privacy inference. HolmesEye uses VLMs to
extract both intra-image and inter-image information and LLMs to guide the
inference process as well as consolidate the results through forensic analysis,
overcoming existing limitations in long-context visual reasoning. Experiments
reveal that HolmesEye achieves a 10.8% improvement in average accuracy over
state-of-the-art baselines and surpasses human-level performance by 15.0% in
predicting abstract attributes. This work highlights the urgency of addressing
privacy risks in image-based profiling and offers both a new dataset and an
advanced framework to guide future research in this area.

Result: GRE在所有地理定位任务粒度上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 推理增强的VLMs在复杂地理推理中表现出高效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization
presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual
cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for
systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack
robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness.
To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE)
Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains
for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is
systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and
benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization
reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual
analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning
strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic
features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced
precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark
(GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across
diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained
(e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly
outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization
tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex
geographic inference. Code and data will be released at

Conclusion: InfoChartQA为提升MLLMs在信息图表理解上的能力提供了新的研究机会。

Abstract: Understanding infographic charts with design-driven visual elements (e.g.,
pictograms, icons) requires both visual recognition and reasoning, posing
challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing

5,642 pairs of infographic and plain charts, each sharing the same underlying

visual-element-based questions to capture their unique visual designs and
communicative intent. Evaluation of 20 MLLMs reveals a substantial performance
decline on infographic charts, particularly for visual-element-based questions
related to metaphors. The paired infographic and plain charts enable
fine-grained error analysis and ablation studies, which highlight new

Abstract: Medical large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising
performance across various single-image question answering (QA) benchmarks, yet
their capability in processing multi-image clinical scenarios remains
underexplored. Unlike single image based tasks, medical tasks involving
multiple images often demand sophisticated visual understanding capabilities,
such as temporal reasoning and cross-modal analysis, which are poorly supported
by current medical LVLMs. To bridge this critical gap, we present the Med-MIM
instruction dataset, comprising 83.2K medical multi-image QA pairs that span
four types of multi-image visual abilities (temporal understanding, reasoning,
comparison, co-reference). Using this dataset, we fine-tune Mantis and
LLaVA-Med, resulting in two specialized medical VLMs: MIM-LLaVA-Med and
Med-Mantis, both optimized for multi-image analysis. Additionally, we develop
the Med-MIM benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the medical multi-image
understanding capabilities of LVLMs. We assess eight popular LVLMs, including
our two models, on the Med-MIM benchmark. Experimental results show that both
Med-Mantis and MIM-LLaVA-Med achieve superior performance on the held-in and
held-out subsets of the Med-MIM benchmark, demonstrating that the Med-MIM

Conclusion: 消除文本和位置偏差可显著提升VLM的边缘识别能力，为图表理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: The diagram is a visual representation of a relationship illustrated with
edges (lines or arrows), which is widely used in industrial and scientific
communication. Although recognizing diagrams is essential for vision language
models (VLMs) to comprehend domain-specific knowledge, recent studies reveal
that many VLMs fail to identify edges in images. We hypothesize that these
failures stem from an over-reliance on textual and positional biases,
preventing VLMs from learning explicit edge features. Based on this idea, we
empirically investigate whether the image encoder in VLMs can learn edge
representation through training on a diagram dataset in which edges are biased
neither by textual nor positional information. To this end, we conduct
contrastive learning on an artificially generated diagram--caption dataset to
train an image encoder and evaluate its diagram-related features on three
tasks: probing, image retrieval, and captioning. Our results show that the
finetuned model outperforms pretrained CLIP in all tasks and surpasses
zero-shot GPT-4o and LLaVA-Mistral in the captioning task. These findings
confirm that eliminating textual and positional biases fosters accurate edge
recognition in VLMs, offering a promising path for advancing diagram
understanding.

Conclusion: PPAD为扩散模型提供了可扩展且高效的语义校正机制。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become the mainstream architecture for text-to-image
generation, achieving remarkable progress in visual quality and prompt
controllability. However, current inference pipelines generally lack
interpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the
denoising process. Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of
the final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making
them ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative
trajectory. As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial
errors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising
prompt-image alignment and image quality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel
framework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language
Model (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference. PPAD performs real-time
analysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic
inconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that
actively guide the remaining denoising steps. The framework supports both
inference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction
at only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and
scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPAD's significant improvements.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for 2D images and
videos has motivated extending these models to understand 3D scenes, aiming for
human-like visual-spatial intelligence. Nevertheless, achieving deep spatial
understanding comparable to human capabilities poses significant challenges in
model encoding and data acquisition. Existing methods frequently depend on
external depth sensors for geometry capture or utilize off-the-shelf algorithms
for pre-constructing 3D maps, thereby limiting their scalability, especially
with prevalent monocular video inputs and for time-sensitive applications. In
this work, we introduce VLM-3R, a unified framework for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) that incorporates 3D Reconstructive instruction tuning. VLM-3R processes
monocular video frames by employing a geometry encoder to derive implicit 3D
tokens that represent spatial understanding. Leveraging our Spatial-Visual-View
Fusion and over 200K curated 3D reconstructive instruction tuning
question-answer (QA) pairs, VLM-3R effectively aligns real-world spatial
context with language instructions. This enables monocular 3D spatial
assistance and embodied reasoning. To facilitate the evaluation of temporal
reasoning, we introduce the Vision-Spatial-Temporal Intelligence benchmark,
featuring over 138.6K QA pairs across five distinct tasks focused on evolving
spatial relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model,
VLM-3R, not only facilitates robust visual-spatial reasoning but also enables
the understanding of temporal 3D context changes, excelling in both accuracy

Method: 提出扩散步骤退火（DiSA），根据生成阶段逐步减少扩散步骤（如从50步降至5步）。

Conclusion: DiSA是一种简单有效的方法，可显著提升自回归模型中扩散采样的效率。

Abstract: An increasing number of autoregressive models, such as MAR, FlowAR, xAR, and
Harmon adopt diffusion sampling to improve the quality of image generation.
However, this strategy leads to low inference efficiency, because it usually
takes 50 to 100 steps for diffusion to sample a token. This paper explores how
to effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens
are generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more
constrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if
a model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog
and thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at
later generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer
perceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising
paths from noise to tokens. Based on our finding, we introduce diffusion step
annealing (DiSA), a training-free method which gradually uses fewer diffusion
steps as more tokens are generated, e.g., using 50 steps at the beginning and
gradually decreasing to 5 steps at later stages. Because DiSA is derived from
our finding specific to diffusion in autoregressive models, it is complementary
to existing acceleration methods designed for diffusion alone. DiSA can be
implemented in only a few lines of code on existing models, and albeit simple,
achieves $5-10\times$ faster inference for MAR and Harmon and $1.4-2.5\times$
for FlowAR and xAR, while maintaining the generation quality.

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion generation typically employs complete-text
conditioning. Due to the intricate syntax, diffusion transformers (DiTs)
inherently suffer from a comprehension defect of complete-text captions.
One-fly complete-text input either overlooks critical semantic details or
causes semantic confusion by simultaneously modeling diverse semantic primitive
types. To mitigate this defect of DiTs, we propose a novel split-text
conditioning framework named DiT-ST. This framework converts a complete-text
caption into a split-text caption, a collection of simplified sentences, to
explicitly express various semantic primitives and their interconnections. The
split-text caption is then injected into different denoising stages of DiT-ST
in a hierarchical and incremental manner. Specifically, DiT-ST leverages Large
Language Models to parse captions, extracting diverse primitives and
hierarchically sorting out and constructing these primitives into a split-text
input. Moreover, we partition the diffusion denoising process according to its
differential sensitivities to diverse semantic primitive types and determine
the appropriate timesteps to incrementally inject tokens of diverse semantic
primitive types into input tokens via cross-attention. In this way, DiT-ST
enhances the representation learning of specific semantic primitive types
across different stages. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
our proposed DiT-ST in mitigating the complete-text comprehension defect.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model using data from one or
multiple related but distinct source domains that can generalize well to unseen
out-of-distribution target domains. Inspired by the success of large
pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), prompt tuning has emerged as an
effective generalization strategy. However, it often struggles to capture
domain-specific features due to its reliance on manually or fixed prompt
inputs. Recently, some prompt generation methods have addressed this limitation
by dynamically generating instance-specific and domain-specific prompts for
each input, enriching domain information and demonstrating potential for
enhanced generalization. Through further investigation, we identify a notable
issue in existing prompt generation methods: the same input often yields
significantly different and suboptimal prompts across different random seeds, a
phenomenon we term Prompt Variability. To address this, we introduce negative
learning into the prompt generation process and propose Dual-Path Stable Soft
Prompt Generation (DPSPG), a transformer-based framework designed to improve
both the stability and generalization of prompts. Specifically, DPSPG
incorporates a complementary prompt generator to produce negative prompts,
thereby reducing the risk of introducing misleading information. Both
theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that negative learning leads to
more robust and effective prompts by increasing the effective margin and
reducing the upper bound of the gradient norm. Extensive experiments on five DG
benchmark datasets show that DPSPG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods while maintaining prompt stability.

Abstract: Current multi-modal models exhibit a notable misalignment with the human
visual system when identifying objects that are visually assimilated into the
background. Our observations reveal that these multi-modal models cannot
distinguish concealed objects, demonstrating an inability to emulate human
cognitive processes which effectively utilize foreground-background similarity
principles for visual analysis. To analyze this hidden human-model visual
thinking discrepancy, we build a visual system that mimicks human visual
camouflaged perception to progressively and iteratively `refocus' visual
concealed content. The refocus is a progressive guidance mechanism enabling
models to logically localize objects in visual images through stepwise
reasoning. The localization process of concealed objects requires hierarchical
attention shifting with dynamic adjustment and refinement of prior cognitive
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a visual refocus reinforcement framework
via the policy optimization algorithm to encourage multi-modal models to think
and refocus more before answering, and achieve excellent reasoning abilities to
align and even surpass human camouflaged perception systems. Our extensive
experiments on camouflaged perception successfully demonstrate the emergence of
refocus visual phenomena, characterized by multiple reasoning tokens and
dynamic adjustment of the detection box. Besides, experimental results on both
camouflaged object classification and detection tasks exhibit significantly
superior performance compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) baselines.

Abstract: In the current research landscape, multimodal autoregressive (AR) models have
shown exceptional capabilities across various domains, including visual
understanding and generation. However, complex tasks such as style-aligned
text-to-image generation present significant challenges, particularly in data
acquisition. In analogy to instruction-following tuning for image editing of AR
models, style-aligned generation requires a reference style image and prompt,
resulting in a text-image-to-image triplet where the output shares the style
and semantics of the input. However, acquiring large volumes of such triplet
data with specific styles is considerably more challenging than obtaining
conventional text-to-image data used for training generative models. To address
this issue, we propose StyleAR, an innovative approach that combines a
specially designed data curation method with our proposed AR models to
effectively utilize text-to-image binary data for style-aligned text-to-image
generation. Our method synthesizes target stylized data using a reference style
image and prompt, but only incorporates the target stylized image as the image
modality to create high-quality binary data. To facilitate binary data
training, we introduce a CLIP image encoder with a perceiver resampler that
translates the image input into style tokens aligned with multimodal tokens in
AR models and implement a style-enhanced token technique to prevent content
leakage which is a common issue in previous work. Furthermore, we mix raw
images drawn from large-scale text-image datasets with stylized images to
enhance StyleAR's ability to extract richer stylistic features and ensure style
consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate our
superior performance.

Abstract: In contrast to vision transformers, which model long-range dependencies
through global self-attention, large kernel convolutions provide a more
efficient and scalable alternative, particularly in high-resolution 3D
volumetric settings. However, naively increasing kernel size often leads to
optimization instability and degradation in performance. Motivated by the
spatial bias observed in effective receptive fields (ERFs), we hypothesize that
different kernel elements converge at variable rates during training. To
support this, we derive a theoretical connection between element-wise gradients
and first-order optimization, showing that structurally re-parameterized
convolution blocks inherently induce spatially varying learning rates. Building
on this insight, we introduce Rep3D, a 3D convolutional framework that
incorporates a learnable spatial prior into large kernel training. A
lightweight two-stage modulation network generates a receptive-biased scaling
mask, adaptively re-weighting kernel updates and enabling local-to-global
convergence behavior. Rep3D adopts a plain encoder design with large depthwise
convolutions, avoiding the architectural complexity of multi-branch
compositions. We evaluate Rep3D on five challenging 3D segmentation benchmarks
and demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
including transformer-based and fixed-prior re-parameterization methods. By
unifying spatial inductive bias with optimization-aware learning, Rep3D offers
an interpretable, and scalable solution for 3D medical image analysis. The

Abstract: Video Diffusion Transformers (VDiTs) have achieved remarkable progress in
high-quality video generation, but remain computationally expensive due to the
quadratic complexity of attention over high-dimensional video sequences. Recent
attention acceleration methods leverage the sparsity of attention patterns to
improve efficiency; however, they often overlook inefficiencies of redundant
long-range interactions. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{VORTA}, an
acceleration framework with two novel components: 1) a sparse attention
mechanism that efficiently captures long-range dependencies, and 2) a routing
strategy that adaptively replaces full 3D attention with specialized sparse
attention variants throughout the sampling process. It achieves a $1.76\times$
end-to-end speedup without quality loss on VBench. Furthermore, VORTA can
seamlessly integrate with various other acceleration methods, such as caching
and step distillation, reaching up to $14.41\times$ speedup with negligible
performance degradation. VORTA demonstrates its efficiency and enhances the

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding in videos remains a
major challenge for current Video Large Multimodal Models (Video LMMs).
Addressing this challenge requires mastering two core capabilities: video
referring understanding, which captures the semantics of video regions, and
video grounding, which segments object regions based on natural language
descriptions. However, most existing approaches tackle these tasks in
isolation, limiting progress toward unified, referentially grounded video
interaction. We identify a key bottleneck in the lack of high-quality, unified
video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
referentially grounded video chat. To address these challenges, we contribute
in three core aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce
SAMA-239K, a large-scale dataset comprising 15K videos specifically curated to
enable joint learning of video referring understanding, grounding, and
multi-turn video chat. Second, we propose the SAMA model, which incorporates a
versatile spatio-temporal context aggregator and a Segment Anything Model to
jointly enhance fine-grained video comprehension and precise grounding
capabilities. Finally, we establish SAMA-Bench, a meticulously designed
benchmark consisting of 5,067 questions from 522 videos, to comprehensively
evaluate the integrated capabilities of Video LMMs in multi-turn,
spatio-temporal referring understanding and grounded dialogue. Extensive
experiments and benchmarking results show that SAMA not only achieves strong
performance on SAMA-Bench but also sets a new state-of-the-art on general
grounding benchmarks, while maintaining highly competitive performance on
standard visual understanding benchmarks.

superpoint-based grouping with coordinate scale normalization consistently
outperforms conventional methods through extensive experimental analysis.
Specifically, we introduce S4Token, a tokenization pipeline that produces
semantically-informed tokens regardless of scene scale. Our tokenizer is
trained without annotations using masked point modeling and clustering-based
objectives, along with cross-modal distillation to align 3D tokens with 2D
multi-view image features. For dense prediction tasks, we propose a

approach leverages LLM prompting to automatically generate multi-level semantic
taxonomies and introduces a recursive uncertainty projection mechanism that
propagates uncertainty across hierarchy levels. This enables spatially diverse,
label-aware point selection that respects the inherent semantic structure of 3D
scenes. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet v2 show that our method achieves up to
4% mIoU improvement under extremely low annotation budgets (e.g., 0.02%),

Recent advances have leveraged generative models to distill datasets by

representativeness. However, these methods do not guarantee sample diversity,
limiting their performance. We propose a mode-guided diffusion model leveraging

Discovery to identify distinct data modes, Mode Guidance to enhance intra-class
diversity, and Stop Guidance to mitigate artifacts in synthetic samples that

Abstract: Charts are high-density visualization carriers for complex data, serving as a

understanding poses significant challenges to existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) due to the need for precise and complex visual
reasoning. Current step-by-step reasoning models primarily focus on text-based
logical reasoning for chart understanding. However, they struggle to refine or
correct their reasoning when errors stem from flawed visual understanding, as
they lack the ability to leverage multimodal interaction for deeper
comprehension. Inspired by human cognitive behavior, we propose ChartSketcher,
a multimodal feedback-driven step-by-step reasoning method designed to address
these limitations. ChartSketcher is a chart understanding model that employs
Sketch-CoT, enabling MLLMs to annotate intermediate reasoning steps directly
onto charts using a programmatic sketching library, iteratively feeding these
visual annotations back into the reasoning process. This mechanism enables the
model to visually ground its reasoning and refine its understanding over
multiple steps. We employ a two-stage training strategy: a cold start phase to
learn sketch-based reasoning patterns, followed by off-policy reinforcement
learning to enhance reflection and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that
ChartSketcher achieves promising performance on chart understanding benchmarks
and general vision tasks, providing an interactive and interpretable approach

Abstract: Masked generative models (MGMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for

modeling. However, generating high-quality samples typically requires many
iterative decoding steps, resulting in high inference costs. A straightforward
way to speed up generation is by decoding more tokens in each step, thereby
reducing the total number of steps. However, when many tokens are decoded
simultaneously, the model can only estimate the univariate marginal
distributions independently, failing to capture the dependency among them. As a
result, reducing the number of steps significantly compromises generation
fidelity. In this work, we introduce ReCAP (Reused Context-Aware Prediction), a
plug-and-play module that accelerates inference in MGMs by constructing
low-cost steps via reusing feature embeddings from previously decoded context
tokens. ReCAP interleaves standard full evaluations with lightweight steps that
cache and reuse context features, substantially reducing computation while
preserving the benefits of fine-grained, iterative generation. We demonstrate
its effectiveness on top of three representative MGMs (MaskGIT, MAGE, and MAR),
including both discrete and continuous token spaces and covering diverse
architectural designs. In particular, on ImageNet256 class-conditional
generation, ReCAP achieves up to 2.4x faster inference than the base model with
minimal performance drop, and consistently delivers better efficiency-fidelity
trade-offs under various generation settings.

Motivation: 理解无分类器引导（CFG）在图像生成系统中的工作机制，目前其机制尚不明确。

Method: 在简化的线性扩散模型中分析CFG，并将其行为与非线性模型对比，识别出三个关键组件。

Result: 线性CFG通过均值偏移、对比主成分增强和抑制通用特征提升生成质量，非线性模型在大部分噪声水平下行为相似。

Conclusion: 线性分析为非线性CFG机制提供了重要见解，尽管在低噪声水平下两者行为有差异。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a core technique powering state-of-the-art
image generation systems, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly
understood. In this work, we begin by analyzing CFG in a simplified linear
diffusion model, where we show its behavior closely resembles that observed in
the nonlinear case. Our analysis reveals that linear CFG improves generation
quality via three distinct components: (i) a mean-shift term that approximately
steers samples in the direction of class means, (ii) a positive Contrastive
Principal Components (CPC) term that amplifies class-specific features, and
(iii) a negative CPC term that suppresses generic features prevalent in
unconditional data. We then verify that these insights in real-world, nonlinear
diffusion models: over a broad range of noise levels, linear CFG resembles the
behavior of its nonlinear counterpart. Although the two eventually diverge at
low noise levels, we discuss how the insights from the linear analysis still
shed light on the CFG's mechanism in the nonlinear regime.

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for adapting
vision-language models such as CLIP to downstream tasks. However, existing
methods often overfit to seen data, leading to significant performance
degradation when generalizing to novel classes or unseen domains. To address
this limitation, we propose DiSa, a Directional Saliency-Aware Prompt Learning
framework that integrates two complementary regularization strategies to
enhance generalization. First, our Cross-Interactive Regularization (CIR)
fosters cross-modal alignment by enabling cooperative learning between prompted
and frozen encoders. Within CIR, a saliency-aware masking strategy guides the
image encoder to prioritize semantically critical image regions, reducing
reliance on less informative patches. Second, we introduce a directional
regularization strategy that aligns visual embeddings with class-wise prototype
features in a directional manner to prioritize consistency in feature
orientation over strict proximity. This approach ensures robust generalization
by leveraging stable prototype directions derived from class-mean statistics.
Extensive evaluations on 11 diverse image classification benchmarks demonstrate
that DiSa consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning methods
across various settings, including base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset
transfer, domain generalization, and few-shot learning.

Abstract: Recent multimodal image generators such as GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and
Gemini 2.5 Pro excel at following complex instructions, editing images and

toolkits: text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks that lacks multi-modal conditioning,
and customized image generation benchmarks that overlook compositional
semantics and common knowledge. We propose MMIG-Bench, a comprehensive
Multi-Modal Image Generation Benchmark that unifies these tasks by pairing
4,850 richly annotated text prompts with 1,750 multi-view reference images
across 380 subjects, spanning humans, animals, objects, and artistic styles.
MMIG-Bench is equipped with a three-level evaluation framework: (1) low-level

Aspect Matching Score (AMS): a VQA-based mid-level metric that delivers
fine-grained prompt-image alignment and shows strong correlation with human

Using MMIG-Bench, we benchmark 17 state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.5

Abstract: Recent methods for zero-shot Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection
typically leverage the generalization ability of large Vision-Language Model
(VLM), i.e., CLIP, on unseen categories, showing impressive results on various
zero-shot settings. However, existing methods struggle to adapt CLIP
representations for human-object pairs, as CLIP tends to overlook fine-grained
information necessary for distinguishing interactions. To address this issue,
we devise, LAIN, a novel zero-shot HOI detection framework enhancing the
locality and interaction awareness of CLIP representations. The locality
awareness, which involves capturing fine-grained details and the spatial
structure of individual objects, is achieved by aggregating the information and
spatial priors of adjacent neighborhood patches. The interaction awareness,
which involves identifying whether and how a human is interacting with an
object, is achieved by capturing the interaction pattern between the human and
the object. By infusing locality and interaction awareness into CLIP
representation, LAIN captures detailed information about the human-object
pairs. Our extensive experiments on existing benchmarks show that LAIN
outperforms previous methods on various zero-shot settings, demonstrating the
importance of locality and interaction awareness for effective zero-shot HOI
detection.

Conclusion: ASR在保留结构信息的同时提升了生成能力，支持人机协作设计，具有高适应性和创造性。

Abstract: Time consumption and the complexity of manual layout design make automated
layout generation a critical task, especially for multiple applications across
different mobile devices. Existing graph-based layout generation approaches
suffer from limited generative capability, often resulting in unreasonable and
incompatible outputs. Meanwhile, vision based generative models tend to
overlook the original structural information, leading to component
intersections and overlaps. To address these challenges, we propose an
Aggregation Structural Representation (ASR) module that integrates graph
networks with large language models (LLMs) to preserve structural information
while enhancing generative capability. This novel pipeline utilizes graph
features as hierarchical prior knowledge, replacing the traditional Vision
Transformer (ViT) module in multimodal large language models (MLLM) to predict
full layout information for the first time. Moreover, the intermediate graph
matrix used as input for the LLM is human editable, enabling progressive, human
centric design generation. A comprehensive evaluation on the RICO dataset
demonstrates the strong performance of ASR, both quantitatively using mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU), and qualitatively through a crowdsourced user
study. Additionally, sampling on relational features ensures diverse layout
generation, further enhancing the adaptability and creativity of the proposed
approach.

Result: 通过理论分析和实证验证，该方法显著提升了组合检索能力。

Conclusion: MVFT-JI结合了VLM的语义对齐能力和MLLM的推理能力，提升了复杂视觉变换场景下的检索性能。

Abstract: Existing Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) methods typically train
adapters that convert reference images into pseudo-text tokens, which are
concatenated with the modifying text and processed by frozen text encoders in
pretrained VLMs or LLMs. While this design leverages the strengths of large
pretrained models, it only supervises the adapter to produce encoder-compatible
tokens that loosely preserve visual semantics. Crucially, it does not directly
optimize the composed query representation to capture the full intent of the
composition or to align with the target semantics, thereby limiting retrieval
performance, particularly in cases involving fine-grained or complex visual
transformations. To address this problem, we propose MLLM-Guided VLM
Fine-Tuning with Joint Inference (MVFT-JI), a novel approach that leverages a
pretrained multimodal large language model (MLLM) to construct two
complementary training tasks using only unlabeled images: target text retrieval
taskand text-to-image retrieval task. By jointly optimizing these tasks, our
method enables the VLM to inherently acquire robust compositional retrieval
capabilities, supported by the provided theoretical justifications and
empirical validation. Furthermore, during inference, we further prompt the MLLM
to generate target texts from composed queries and compute retrieval scores by
integrating similarities between (i) the composed query and candidate images,
and (ii) the MLLM-generated target text and candidate images. This strategy
effectively combines the VLM's semantic alignment strengths with the MLLM's
reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: MRA框架通过消除文本中介，直接建模图像与文本关系，显著提升ZS-CIR性能。

Abstract: Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images
given a compositional query, consisting of a reference image and a modifying
text-without relying on annotated training data. Existing approaches often
generate a synthetic target text using large language models (LLMs) to serve as
an intermediate anchor between the compositional query and the target image.
Models are then trained to align the compositional query with the generated
text, and separately align images with their corresponding texts using
contrastive learning. However, this reliance on intermediate text introduces
error propagation, as inaccuracies in query-to-text and text-to-image mappings
accumulate, ultimately degrading retrieval performance. To address these
problems, we propose a novel framework by employing a Multimodal Reasoning
Agent (MRA) for ZS-CIR. MRA eliminates the dependence on textual intermediaries
by directly constructing triplets, <reference image, modification text, target
image>, using only unlabeled image data. By training on these synthetic
triplets, our model learns to capture the relationships between compositional
queries and candidate images directly. Extensive experiments on three standard
CIR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the FashionIQ
dataset, our method improves Average R@10 by at least 7.5\% over existing
baselines; on CIRR, it boosts R@1 by 9.6\%; and on CIRCO, it increases mAP@5 by
9.5\%.

Abstract: We present OvSGTR, a novel transformer-based framework for fully
open-vocabulary scene graph generation that overcomes the limitations of
traditional closed-set models. Conventional methods restrict both object and
relationship recognition to a fixed vocabulary, hindering their applicability
to real-world scenarios where novel concepts frequently emerge. In contrast,
our approach jointly predicts objects (nodes) and their inter-relationships
(edges) beyond predefined categories. OvSGTR leverages a DETR-like architecture
featuring a frozen image backbone and text encoder to extract high-quality
visual and semantic features, which are then fused via a transformer decoder
for end-to-end scene graph prediction. To enrich the model's understanding of
complex visual relations, we propose a relation-aware pre-training strategy
that synthesizes scene graph annotations in a weakly supervised manner.
Specifically, we investigate three pipelines--scene parser-based, LLM-based,
and multimodal LLM-based--to generate transferable supervision signals with
minimal manual annotation. Furthermore, we address the common issue of
catastrophic forgetting in open-vocabulary settings by incorporating a
visual-concept retention mechanism coupled with a knowledge distillation
strategy, ensuring that the model retains rich semantic cues during
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on the VG150 benchmark demonstrate that
OvSGTR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings,
including closed-set, open-vocabulary object detection-based, relation-based,
and fully open-vocabulary scenarios. Our results highlight the promise of
large-scale relation-aware pre-training and transformer architectures for
advancing scene graph generation towards more generalized and reliable visual

Abstract: Advanced autoregressive models have reshaped multimodal AI. However, their
transformative potential in medical imaging remains largely untapped due to the
absence of a unified visual tokenizer -- one capable of capturing fine-grained
visual structures for faithful image reconstruction and realistic image

high-level clinical semantics within a unified latent space. To balance these
competing objectives, we introduce a novel two-stage training framework: a
visual representation alignment stage that cold-starts the tokenizer
reconstruction learning with a visual semantic constraint, followed by a
textual semantic representation alignment stage that infuses detailed clinical
semantics into the latent space. Trained on the meticulously collected
large-scale dataset with over 30 million medical images and 2 million
image-caption pairs, MedITok achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) generation models have advanced significantly,
enabling the creation of high-fidelity images from textual prompts. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on the explicit alignment
between generated images and prompts, neglecting the alignment with real-world

Prompts (ABP), a comprehensive benchmark designed to measure the alignment of
generated images with real-world knowledge that extends beyond the explicit
user prompts. ABP comprises over 2,000 meticulously crafted prompts, covering
real-world knowledge across six distinct scenarios. We further introduce
ABPScore, a metric that utilizes existing Multimodal Large Language Models

beyond prompts, which demonstrates strong correlations with human judgments.
Through a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular T2I models using ABP, we find
that even state-of-the-art models, such as GPT-4o, face limitations in
integrating simple real-world knowledge into generated images. To mitigate this

exploration while maintaining a stable optimization anchor through reference
model regularization. Second, we present a timestep-aware training strategy

architectures of the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique. We demonstrate the
capabilities of our method by developing and evaluating models using the widely
adopted CNN backbone pre-trained on ImageNet. We observed that this strategy
results in a stable and accurate coarse-tuning procedure. Moreover, this
strategy is computationally efficient and significantly reduces the number of
parameters required for fine-tuning compared to traditional methods.
Furthermore, our method substantially improves the speed and stability of
training. Our case study focuses on classifying retinal diseases from optical
coherence tomography (OCT) images, specifically using the OCTMNIST dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that a CNN backbone fine-tuned with CoLoRA
surpasses nearly 1\% in accuracy. Such a performance is comparable to the
Vision Transformer, State-space discrete, and Kolmogorov-Arnold network models.

Abstract: Recent deep learning models demand larger datasets, driving the need for
dataset distillation to create compact, cost-efficient datasets while
maintaining performance. Due to the powerful image generation capability of
diffusion, it has been introduced to this field for generating distilled
images. In this paper, we systematically investigate issues present in current
diffusion-based dataset distillation methods, including inaccurate distribution
matching, distribution deviation with random noise, and separate sampling.
Building on this, we propose D^3HR, a novel diffusion-based framework to
generate distilled datasets with high representativeness. Specifically, we
adopt DDIM inversion to map the latents of the full dataset from a
low-normality latent domain to a high-normality Gaussian domain, preserving
information and ensuring structural consistency to generate representative
latents for the distilled dataset. Furthermore, we propose an efficient
sampling scheme to better align the representative latents with the
high-normality Gaussian distribution. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate

Abstract: Context bias refers to the association between the foreground objects and
background during the object detection training process. Various methods have
been proposed to minimize the context bias when applying the trained model to
an unseen domain, known as domain adaptation for object detection (DAOD). But a
principled approach to understand why the context bias occurs and how to remove
it has been missing.
  In this work, we provide a causal view of the context bias, pointing towards
the pooling operation in the convolution network architecture as the possible
source of this bias. We present an alternative, Mask Pooling, which uses an
additional input of foreground masks, to separate the pooling process in the
respective foreground and background regions and show that this process leads
the trained model to detect objects in a more robust manner under different
domains. We also provide a benchmark designed to create an ultimate test for
DAOD, using foregrounds in the presence of absolute random backgrounds, to
analyze the robustness of the intended trained models. Through these
experiments, we hope to provide a principled approach for minimizing context

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合顺序小批量采样（MoMBS）方法，通过结合损失和不确定性来优化多样质量训练样本的使用，解决了传统方法在处理样本多样性时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像在通用病变检测（ULD）中存在图像质量和标签正确性的多样性，传统方法（如SCL和OHEM）在处理这些问题时存在不足。

Method: 提出MoMBS方法，结合损失和不确定性度量样本硬度，并通过混合顺序小批量采样设计优化样本利用。

Result: MoMBS能够更精细地分类高损失样本，并优先利用代表性不足的样本，避免受噪声或过拟合样本的负面影响。

Conclusion: MoMBS在处理多样质量训练样本时优于传统方法，为深度学习模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Natural images exhibit label diversity (clean vs. noisy) in noisy-labeled
image classification and prevalence diversity (abundant vs. sparse) in
long-tailed image classification. Similarly, medical images in universal lesion
detection (ULD) exhibit substantial variations in image quality, encompassing
attributes such as clarity and label correctness. How to effectively leverage
training images with diverse qualities becomes a problem in learning deep
models. Conventional training mechanisms, such as self-paced curriculum
learning (SCL) and online hard example mining (OHEM), relieve this problem by
reweighting images with high loss values. Despite their success, these methods
still confront two challenges: (i) the loss-based measure of sample hardness is
imprecise, preventing optimum handling of different cases, and (ii) there
exists under-utilization in SCL or over-utilization OHEM with the identified
hard samples. To address these issues, this paper revisits the minibatch
sampling (MBS), a technique widely used in deep network training but largely
unexplored concerning the handling of diverse-quality training samples. We
discover that the samples within a minibatch influence each other during
training; thus, we propose a novel Mixed-order Minibatch Sampling (MoMBS)
method to optimize the use of training samples with diverse qualities. MoMBS
introduces a measure that takes both loss and uncertainty into account to
surpass a sole reliance on loss and allows for a more refined categorization of
high-loss samples by distinguishing them as either poorly labeled and under
represented or well represented and overfitted. We prioritize under represented
samples as the main gradient contributors in a minibatch and keep them from the
negative influences of poorly labeled or overfitted samples with a mixed-order
minibatch sampling design.

Motivation: 针对文本到图像扩散模型（如DreamBooth和Textual Inversion）在风格模仿和个性化定制中的滥用问题，现有防御方法（如Glaze和Anti-DreamBooth）易受净化攻击（如DiffPure和Noise Upscaling）且跨模型泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出StyleGuard方法，包括优化潜在空间风格特征的风格损失和利用集成净化器和上采样器训练的上采样损失，以提高对抗攻击的鲁棒性和跨模型泛化能力。

Result: 在WikiArt和CelebA数据集上的实验表明，StyleGuard在对抗多种变换和净化攻击时优于现有方法，并能有效应对不同风格模仿方法（如DreamBooth和Textual Inversion）。

Conclusion: StyleGuard通过新颖的损失函数设计，显著提升了对抗风格模仿攻击的鲁棒性和跨模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have been widely used for style
mimicry and personalized customization through methods such as DreamBooth and
Textual Inversion. This has raised concerns about intellectual property
protection and the generation of deceptive content. Recent studies, such as
Glaze and Anti-DreamBooth, have proposed using adversarial noise to protect
images from these attacks. However, recent purification-based methods, such as
DiffPure and Noise Upscaling, have successfully attacked these latest defenses,
showing the vulnerabilities of these methods. Moreover, present methods show
limited transferability across models, making them less effective against
unknown text-to-image models. To address these issues, we propose a novel
anti-mimicry method, StyleGuard. We propose a novel style loss that optimizes
the style-related features in the latent space to make it deviate from the
original image, which improves model-agnostic transferability. Additionally, to
enhance the perturbation's ability to bypass diffusion-based purification, we
designed a novel upscale loss that involves ensemble purifiers and upscalers
during training. Extensive experiments on the WikiArt and CelebA datasets
demonstrate that StyleGuard outperforms existing methods in robustness against
various transformations and purifications, effectively countering style mimicry
in various models. Moreover, StyleGuard is effective on different style mimicry
methods, including DreamBooth and Textual Inversion.

constructed through an inductive process that identifies 75 chart types, 330
chart variations, and 68 layout templates from real infographic charts and uses
them to create synthetic ones programmatically. We showcase the utility of this
dataset through: 1) improving infographic chart understanding via fine-tuning,
2) benchmarking code generation for infographic charts, and 3) enabling
example-based infographic chart generation. By capturing the visual and
structural complexity of real design, ChartGalaxy provides a useful resource

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) detectors face significant challenges when deployed in
real-world environments, particularly when encountering test samples deviated
from training data through either postprocessing manipulations or distribution
shifts. We demonstrate postprocessing techniques can completely obscure
generation artifacts presented in DF samples, leading to performance
degradation of DF detectors. To address these challenges, we propose Think
Twice before Adaptation (\texttt{T$^2$A}), a novel online test-time adaptation
method that enhances the adaptability of detectors during inference without
requiring access to source training data or labels. Our key idea is to enable
the model to explore alternative options through an Uncertainty-aware Negative
Learning objective rather than solely relying on its initial predictions as
commonly seen in entropy minimization (EM)-based approaches. We also introduce
an Uncertain Sample Prioritization strategy and Gradients Masking technique to
improve the adaptation by focusing on important samples and model parameters.
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed negative learning
objective exhibits complementary behavior to EM, facilitating better adaptation
capability. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared
to existing test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches and significantly enhances
the resilience and generalization of DF detectors during inference. Code is

Conclusion: REGen在短视频生成中实现了连贯叙事与视频引用的结合，表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: Short videos are an effective tool for promoting contents and improving
knowledge accessibility. While existing extractive video summarization methods
struggle to produce a coherent narrative, existing abstractive methods cannot
`quote' from the input videos, i.e., inserting short video clips in their
outputs. In this work, we explore novel video editing models for generating
shorts that feature a coherent narrative with embedded video insertions
extracted from a long input video. We propose a novel retrieval-embedded
generation framework that allows a large language model to quote multimodal
resources while maintaining a coherent narrative. Our proposed REGen system
first generates the output story script with quote placeholders using a
finetuned large language model, and then uses a novel retrieval model to
replace the quote placeholders by selecting a video clip that best supports the
narrative from a pool of candidate quotable video clips. We examine the
proposed method on the task of documentary teaser generation, where short
interview insertions are commonly used to support the narrative of a
documentary. Our objective evaluations show that the proposed method can
effectively insert short video clips while maintaining a coherent narrative. In
a subjective survey, we show that our proposed method outperforms existing
abstractive and extractive approaches in terms of coherence, alignment, and
realism in teaser generation.

Conclusion: 该模型在多模态应用中具有广泛潜力。

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has become a critical research area because integrating
text and image data can significantly improve performance in tasks such as
classification, retrieval, and scene understanding. However, despite progress
with pre-trained models, current approaches are limited by inadequate
cross-modal interactions and static fusion strategies that do not fully exploit
the complementary nature of different modalities. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a novel multi-modal Co-AttenDWG architecture that
leverages dual-path encoding, co-attention with dimension-wise gating, and
advanced expert fusion. Our approach begins by projecting text and image
features into a common embedding space, where a dedicated co-attention
mechanism enables simultaneous, fine-grained interactions between modalities.
This mechanism is further enhanced by a dimension-wise gating network that
adaptively regulates the feature contributions at the channel level, ensuring
that only the most relevant information is emphasized. In parallel, dual-path
encoders refine the representations by processing cross-modal information
separately before an additional cross-attention layer further aligns
modalities. The refined features are then aggregated via an expert fusion
module that combines learned gating and self-attention to produce a robust,
unified representation. We validate our approach on the MIMIC and SemEval
Memotion 1.0, where experimental results demonstrate significant improvements
in cross-modal alignment and state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the
potential of our model for a wide range of multi-modal applications.

Abstract: Visual generation and understanding are two deeply interconnected aspects of
human intelligence, yet they have been traditionally treated as separate tasks
in machine learning. In this paper, we propose Jodi, a diffusion framework that
unifies visual generation and understanding by jointly modeling the image
domain and multiple label domains. Specifically, Jodi is built upon a linear
diffusion transformer along with a role switch mechanism, which enables it to
perform three particular types of tasks: (1) joint generation, where the model
simultaneously generates images and multiple labels; (2) controllable
generation, where images are generated conditioned on any combination of
labels; and (3) image perception, where multiple labels can be predicted at
once from a given image. Furthermore, we present the Joint-1.6M dataset, which
contains 200,000 high-quality images collected from public sources, automatic
labels for 7 visual domains, and LLM-generated captions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Jodi excels in both generation and understanding tasks and
exhibits strong extensibility to a wider range of visual domains. Code is

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
photorealistic visual content, offering practical substitutes for real images
and videos in scenarios where acquiring real data is difficult or expensive.
However, reliably substituting real visual content with AI-generated
counterparts requires robust assessment of the perceived realness of
AI-generated visual content, a challenging task due to its inherent subjective
nature. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive human study evaluating
the perceptual realness of both real and AI-generated images, resulting in a
new dataset, containing images paired with subjective realness scores,
introduced as RAISE in this paper. Further, we develop and train multiple
models on RAISE to establish baselines for realness prediction. Our
experimental results demonstrate that features derived from deep foundation
vision models can effectively capture the subjective realness. RAISE thus
provides a valuable resource for developing robust, objective models of
perceptual realness assessment.

alignment of existing multi-modal embeddings. VisRet first projects textual

within the image modality to bypass the weaknesses of cross-modal retrievers in
recognizing subtle visual-spatial features. Experiments on three
knowledge-intensive T2I retrieval benchmarks, including a newly introduced
multi-entity benchmark, demonstrate that VisRet consistently improves T2I
retrieval by 24.5% to 32.7% NDCG@10 across different embedding models. VisRet
also significantly benefits downstream visual question answering accuracy when
used in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines. The method is plug-and-play

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation models have sparked interest in world
models capable of simulating realistic environments. While navigation has been
well-explored, physically meaningful interactions that mimic real-world forces
remain largely understudied. In this work, we investigate using physical forces
as a control signal for video generation and propose force prompts which enable
users to interact with images through both localized point forces, such as
poking a plant, and global wind force fields, such as wind blowing on fabric.
We demonstrate that these force prompts can enable videos to respond
realistically to physical control signals by leveraging the visual and motion
prior in the original pretrained model, without using any 3D asset or physics
simulator at inference. The primary challenge of force prompting is the
difficulty in obtaining high quality paired force-video training data, both in
the real world due to the difficulty of obtaining force signals, and in
synthetic data due to limitations in the visual quality and domain diversity of
physics simulators. Our key finding is that video generation models can
generalize remarkably well when adapted to follow physical force conditioning
from videos synthesized by Blender, even with limited demonstrations of few
objects. Our method can generate videos which simulate forces across diverse
geometries, settings, and materials. We also try to understand the source of
this generalization and perform ablations that reveal two key elements: visual
diversity and the use of specific text keywords during training. Our approach
is trained on only around 15k training examples for a single day on four A100
GPUs, and outperforms existing methods on force adherence and physics realism,
bringing world models closer to real-world physics interactions. We release all

Conclusion: CSTrack通过紧凑的时空建模简化了RGB-X跟踪任务，同时提升了效果。

Abstract: Effectively modeling and utilizing spatiotemporal features from RGB and other
modalities (\eg, depth, thermal, and event data, denoted as X) is the core of
RGB-X tracker design. Existing methods often employ two parallel branches to
separately process the RGB and X input streams, requiring the model to
simultaneously handle two dispersed feature spaces, which complicates both the
model structure and computation process. More critically, intra-modality
spatial modeling within each dispersed space incurs substantial computational
overhead, limiting resources for inter-modality spatial modeling and temporal
modeling. To address this, we propose a novel tracker, CSTrack, which focuses
on modeling Compact Spatiotemporal features to achieve simple yet effective
tracking. Specifically, we first introduce an innovative Spatial Compact Module
that integrates the RGB-X dual input streams into a compact spatial feature,
enabling thorough intra- and inter-modality spatial modeling. Additionally, we
design an efficient Temporal Compact Module that compactly represents temporal
features by constructing the refined target distribution heatmap. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of our compact spatiotemporal modeling
method, with CSTrack achieving new SOTA results on mainstream RGB-X benchmarks.

Method: 提出MM-Prompt框架，结合跨模态提示查询和恢复，通过对齐损失防止表征漂移。

Result: 实验表明MM-Prompt在准确性和知识保留上优于现有方法，同时保持模态平衡。

Conclusion: MM-Prompt为持续多模态学习提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Visual Question Answering (CVQA) based on pre-trained models(PTMs)
has achieved promising progress by leveraging prompt tuning to enable continual
multi-modal learning. However, most existing methods adopt cross-modal prompt
isolation, constructing visual and textual prompts separately, which
exacerbates modality imbalance and leads to degraded performance over time. To
tackle this issue, we propose MM-Prompt, a novel framework incorporating
cross-modal prompt query and cross-modal prompt recovery. The former enables
balanced prompt selection by incorporating cross-modal signals during query
formation, while the latter promotes joint prompt reconstruction through
iterative cross-modal interactions, guided by an alignment loss to prevent
representational drift. Extensive experiments show that MM-Prompt surpasses
prior approaches in accuracy and knowledge retention, while maintaining
balanced modality engagement throughout continual learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于事件感知的视觉模仿方法，通过将RGB视频转换为稀疏的事件表示，消除外观特征的影响，从而在专家与学习者环境存在视觉差异时实现鲁棒的模仿学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉模仿在专家演示与学习者环境存在领域偏移（如光照、颜色或纹理差异）时容易失败。现有方法（如视觉随机化）计算成本高且难以应对未见场景。

Method: 将标准RGB视频转换为稀疏的事件表示，编码时间强度梯度，丢弃静态外观特征。训练策略基于事件流，避免昂贵且环境特定的数据增强。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite和Adroit平台上验证了方法的有效性，实现了对视觉干扰的不变性。

Conclusion: 事件感知方法通过消除外观影响，提供了一种鲁棒的视觉模仿解决方案。

Abstract: Imitation from videos often fails when expert demonstrations and learner
environments exhibit domain shifts, such as discrepancies in lighting, color,
or texture. While visual randomization partially addresses this problem by
augmenting training data, it remains computationally intensive and inherently
reactive, struggling with unseen scenarios. We propose a different approach:
instead of randomizing appearances, we eliminate their influence entirely by
rethinking the sensory representation itself. Inspired by biological vision
systems that prioritize temporal transients (e.g., retinal ganglion cells) and
by recent sensor advancements, we introduce event-inspired perception for
visually robust imitation. Our method converts standard RGB videos into a
sparse, event-based representation that encodes temporal intensity gradients,
discarding static appearance features. This biologically grounded approach
disentangles motion dynamics from visual style, enabling robust visual
imitation from observations even in the presence of visual mismatches between
expert and agent environments. By training policies on event streams, we
achieve invariance to appearance-based distractors without requiring
computationally expensive and environment-specific data augmentation
techniques. Experiments across the DeepMind Control Suite and the Adroit
platform for dynamic dexterous manipulation show the efficacy of our method.
Our code is publicly available at Eb-LAIfO.

Result: WorldEval与真实场景中的策略性能高度相关，且优于现有方法（如real-to-sim）。

Conclusion: 世界模型可作为机器人策略评估的可靠代理，显著提升评估效率和安全性。

Abstract: The field of robotics has made significant strides toward developing
generalist robot manipulation policies. However, evaluating these policies in
real-world scenarios remains time-consuming and challenging, particularly as
the number of tasks scales and environmental conditions change. In this work,
we demonstrate that world models can serve as a scalable, reproducible, and
reliable proxy for real-world robot policy evaluation. A key challenge is
generating accurate policy videos from world models that faithfully reflect the
robot actions. We observe that directly inputting robot actions or using
high-dimensional encoding methods often fails to generate action-following
videos. To address this, we propose Policy2Vec, a simple yet effective approach
to turn a video generation model into a world simulator that follows latent
action to generate the robot video. We then introduce WorldEval, an automated
pipeline designed to evaluate real-world robot policies entirely online.
WorldEval effectively ranks various robot policies and individual checkpoints
within a single policy, and functions as a safety detector to prevent dangerous
actions by newly developed robot models. Through comprehensive paired
evaluations of manipulation policies in real-world environments, we demonstrate
a strong correlation between policy performance in WorldEval and real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, our method significantly outperforms popular methods
such as real-to-sim approach.

Conclusion: 研究为条件策略和幅度控制提供了新见解，并公开了方法实现。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, but
remain challenging to train due to their inherent stochasticity, where
high-variance gradient estimates lead to slow convergence. Previous works have
shown that magnitude preservation helps with stabilizing training in the U-net
architecture. This work explores whether this effect extends to the Diffusion
Transformer (DiT) architecture. As such, we propose a magnitude-preserving
design that stabilizes training without normalization layers. Motivated by the
goal of maintaining activation magnitudes, we additionally introduce rotation
modulation, which is a novel conditioning method using learned rotations
instead of traditional scaling or shifting. Through empirical evaluations and
ablation studies on small-scale models, we show that magnitude-preserving
strategies significantly improve performance, notably reducing FID scores by
$\sim$12.8%. Further, we show that rotation modulation combined with scaling is
competitive with AdaLN, while requiring $\sim$5.4% fewer parameters. This work
provides insights into conditioning strategies and magnitude control. We will
publicly release the implementation of our method.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enhanced their image inpainting
and editing capabilities but also introduced significant societal risks.
Adversaries can exploit user images from social media to generate misleading or
harmful content. While adversarial perturbations can disrupt inpainting, global
perturbation-based methods fail in mask-guided editing tasks due to spatial
constraints. To address these challenges, we propose Structure Disruption
Attack (SDA), a powerful protection framework for safeguarding sensitive image
regions against inpainting-based editing. Building upon the contour-focused
nature of self-attention mechanisms of diffusion models, SDA optimizes
perturbations by disrupting queries in self-attention during the initial
denoising step to destroy the contour generation process. This targeted
interference directly disrupts the structural generation capability of
diffusion models, effectively preventing them from producing coherent images.
We validate our motivation through visualization techniques and extensive
experiments on public datasets, demonstrating that SDA achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) protection performance while maintaining strong
robustness.

Abstract: Image segmentation remains a challenging task in computer vision, demanding
robust mask generation and precise classification. Recent mask-based approaches
yield high-quality masks by capturing global context. However, accurately
classifying these masks, especially in the presence of ambiguous boundaries and
imbalanced class distributions, remains an open challenge. In this work, we
introduce ViT-P, a novel two-stage segmentation framework that decouples mask
generation from classification. The first stage employs a proposal generator to
produce class-agnostic mask proposals, while the second stage utilizes a
point-based classification model built on the Vision Transformer (ViT) to
refine predictions by focusing on mask central points. ViT-P serves as a
pre-training-free adapter, allowing the integration of various pre-trained
vision transformers without modifying their architecture, ensuring adaptability
to dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coarse and bounding
box annotations can effectively enhance classification without requiring
additional training on fine annotation datasets, reducing annotation costs
while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments across COCO,
ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets validate the effectiveness of ViT-P, achieving
state-of-the-art results with 54.0 PQ on ADE20K panoptic segmentation, 87.4
mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation, and 63.6 mIoU on ADE20K semantic

Result: 实验表明PSG模型优于现有方法，验证了视觉信息剪枝在MMT中的潜力。

Conclusion: 视觉信息剪枝是推动MMT领域发展的有效途径。

Abstract: Multimodal machine translation (MMT) seeks to address the challenges posed by
linguistic polysemy and ambiguity in translation tasks by incorporating visual
information. A key bottleneck in current MMT research is the effective
utilization of visual data. Previous approaches have focused on extracting
global or region-level image features and using attention or gating mechanisms
for multimodal information fusion. However, these methods have not adequately
tackled the issue of visual information redundancy in MMT, nor have they
proposed effective solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach--multimodal machine translation with visual Scene Graph Pruning (PSG),
which leverages language scene graph information to guide the pruning of
redundant nodes in visual scene graphs, thereby reducing noise in downstream
translation tasks. Through extensive comparative experiments with
state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of the PSG model. Our results also highlight the promising potential of visual
information pruning in advancing the field of MMT.

Abstract: Evaluating the video understanding capabilities of Video-Language Models
(VLMs) remains a significant challenge. We propose a long-context video
understanding benchmark, Causal2Needles, that assesses two crucial abilities
insufficiently evaluated by existing benchmarks: (1) the ability to extract
information from two separate locations in a long video and understand them
jointly, and (2) the ability to model the world in terms of cause and effect in
human behaviors. Specifically, Causal2Needles introduces 2-needle questions,
which require extracting information from both the cause and effect
human-behavior events in a long video and the associated narration text. To
prevent textual bias, these questions comprise two complementary formats: one
asking to identify the video clip containing the answer, and one asking for the
textual description of an unrelated visual detail from that video clip. Our
experiments reveal that models excelling in pre-existing benchmarks struggle
with 2-needle visual grounding, and the model performance is negatively
correlated with the distance between the two needles. These findings highlight
critical limitations in current VLMs.

Result: 实验表明，MOTE在公平性和隐私方面有显著提升，但增加了推理时间和存储需求。

Conclusion: MOTE适用于中小规模应用，尤其是在公平性和隐私要求高的场景。

Abstract: Traditional face recognition systems rely on extracting fixed face
representations, known as templates, to store and verify identities. These
representations are typically generated by neural networks that often lack
explainability and raise concerns regarding fairness and privacy. In this work,
we propose a novel model-template (MOTE) approach that replaces vector-based
face templates with small personalized neural networks. This design enables
more responsible face recognition for small and medium-scale systems. During
enrollment, MOTE creates a dedicated binary classifier for each identity,
trained to determine whether an input face matches the enrolled identity. Each
classifier is trained using only a single reference sample, along with
synthetically balanced samples to allow adjusting fairness at the level of a
single individual during enrollment. Extensive experiments across multiple
datasets and recognition systems demonstrate substantial improvements in
fairness and particularly in privacy. Although the method increases inference
time and storage requirements, it presents a strong solution for small- and
mid-scale applications where fairness and privacy are critical.

Abstract: Effective human-AI interaction relies on AI's ability to accurately perceive

models are severely limited, offering a narrow emotional spectrum that
overlooks nuanced states (e.g., bitterness, intoxication) and fails to
distinguish subtle differences between related feelings (e.g., shame vs.

occluded faces and lack demographic diversity, risking significant bias. To

taxonomy, meticulously derived from foundational research to capture finer
details of human emotional experiences. (2) Three large-scale, AI-generated

Conclusion: ViTaPEs为视觉触觉感知提供了高效、通用的解决方案，具有强大的泛化和迁移学习能力。

Abstract: Tactile sensing provides local essential information that is complementary to
visual perception, such as texture, compliance, and force. Despite recent
advances in visuotactile representation learning, challenges remain in fusing
these modalities and generalizing across tasks and environments without heavy
reliance on pre-trained vision-language models. Moreover, existing methods do
not study positional encodings, thereby overlooking the multi-scale spatial
reasoning needed to capture fine-grained visuotactile correlations. We
introduce ViTaPEs, a transformer-based framework that robustly integrates
visual and tactile input data to learn task-agnostic representations for
visuotactile perception. Our approach exploits a novel multi-scale positional
encoding scheme to capture intra-modal structures, while simultaneously
modeling cross-modal cues. Unlike prior work, we provide provable guarantees in
visuotactile fusion, showing that our encodings are injective,
rigid-motion-equivariant, and information-preserving, validating these
properties empirically. Experiments on multiple large-scale real-world datasets
show that ViTaPEs not only surpasses state-of-the-art baselines across various
recognition tasks but also demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen,
out-of-domain scenarios. We further demonstrate the transfer-learning strength
of ViTaPEs in a robotic grasping task, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in predicting grasp success. Project page:

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enhanced multimodal-guided visual
generation, enabling customized subject insertion that seamlessly "brushes"
user-specified objects into a given image guided by textual prompts. However,
existing methods often struggle to insert customized subjects with high
fidelity and align results with the user's intent through textual prompts. In
this work, we propose "In-Context Brush", a zero-shot framework for customized
subject insertion by reformulating the task within the paradigm of in-context
learning. Without loss of generality, we formulate the object image and the
textual prompts as cross-modal demonstrations, and the target image with the
masked region as the query. The goal is to inpaint the target image with the
subject aligning textual prompts without model tuning. Building upon a
pretrained MMDiT-based inpainting network, we perform test-time enhancement via
dual-level latent space manipulation: intra-head "latent feature shifting"
within each attention head that dynamically shifts attention outputs to reflect
the desired subject semantics and inter-head "attention reweighting" across
different heads that amplifies prompt controllability through differential
attention prioritization. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior identity preservation, text alignment, and
image quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring
dedicated training or additional data collection.

Abstract: Subject-to-Video (S2V) generation aims to create videos that faithfully
incorporate reference content, providing enhanced flexibility in the production
of videos. To establish the infrastructure for S2V generation, we propose
OpenS2V-Nexus, consisting of (i) OpenS2V-Eval, a fine-grained benchmark, and
(ii) OpenS2V-5M, a million-scale dataset. In contrast to existing S2V
benchmarks inherited from VBench that focus on global and coarse-grained
assessment of generated videos, OpenS2V-Eval focuses on the model's ability to
generate subject-consistent videos with natural subject appearance and identity
fidelity. For these purposes, OpenS2V-Eval introduces 180 prompts from seven
major categories of S2V, which incorporate both real and synthetic test data.
Furthermore, to accurately align human preferences with S2V benchmarks, we
propose three automatic metrics, NexusScore, NaturalScore and GmeScore, to
separately quantify subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in
generated videos. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
representative S2V models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across
different content. Moreover, we create the first open-source large-scale S2V
generation dataset OpenS2V-5M, which consists of five million high-quality 720P
subject-text-video triples. Specifically, we ensure subject-information
diversity in our dataset by (1) segmenting subjects and building pairing
information via cross-video associations and (2) prompting GPT-Image-1 on raw
frames to synthesize multi-view representations. Through OpenS2V-Nexus, we
deliver a robust infrastructure to accelerate future S2V generation research.

Method: 从患者骨骼关节中提取特征，输入预训练LLMs，结合零样本、少样本、思维链和角色扮演等提示技术生成反馈。

Result: 在UI-PRMD和REHAB24-6数据集上验证了方法在评估、推理和反馈生成方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法可集成到虚拟康复平台中，帮助患者正确训练并改善健康结果。

Abstract: Exercise-based rehabilitation improves quality of life and reduces morbidity,
mortality, and rehospitalization, though transportation constraints and staff
shortages lead to high dropout rates from rehabilitation programs. Virtual
platforms enable patients to complete prescribed exercises at home, while AI
algorithms analyze performance, deliver feedback, and update clinicians.
Although many studies have developed machine learning and deep learning models
for exercise quality assessment, few have explored the use of large language
models (LLMs) for feedback and are limited by the lack of rehabilitation
datasets containing textual feedback. In this paper, we propose a new method in
which exercise-specific features are extracted from the skeletal joints of
patients performing rehabilitation exercises and fed into pre-trained LLMs.
Using a range of prompting techniques, such as zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, and role-play prompting, LLMs are leveraged to evaluate
exercise quality and provide feedback in natural language to help patients
improve their movements. The method was evaluated through extensive experiments
on two publicly available rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets (UI-PRMD
and REHAB24-6) and showed promising results in exercise assessment, reasoning,
and feedback generation. This approach can be integrated into virtual
rehabilitation platforms to help patients perform exercises correctly, support
recovery, and improve health outcomes.

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced image stylization significantly, yet two core
challenges persist: (1) maintaining consistent stylization in complex scenes,
particularly identity, composition, and fine details, and (2) preventing style

generalization; (2) a two-stage progressive learning strategy decoupling style
learning from consistency preservation to mitigate style degradation; and (3) a

Conclusion: HonestFace在修复人脸时表现出更高的保真度和真实性，代码和预训练模型将公开。

Abstract: Face restoration has achieved remarkable advancements through the years of
development. However, ensuring that restored facial images exhibit high
fidelity, preserve authentic features, and avoid introducing artifacts or
biases remains a significant challenge. This highlights the need for models
that are more "honest" in their reconstruction from low-quality inputs,
accurately reflecting original characteristics. In this work, we propose
HonestFace, a novel approach designed to restore faces with a strong emphasis
on such honesty, particularly concerning identity consistency and texture
realism. To achieve this, HonestFace incorporates several key components.
First, we propose an identity embedder to effectively capture and preserve
crucial identity features from both the low-quality input and multiple
reference faces. Second, a masked face alignment method is presented to enhance
fine-grained details and textural authenticity, thereby preventing the
generation of patterned or overly synthetic textures and improving overall
clarity. Furthermore, we present a new landmark-based evaluation metric. Based
on affine transformation principles, this metric improves the accuracy compared
to conventional L2 distance calculations for facial feature alignment.
Leveraging these contributions within a one-step diffusion model framework,
HonestFace delivers exceptional restoration results in terms of facial fidelity
and realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both
visual quality and quantitative assessments. The code and pre-trained models

Conclusion: 通过减少轨迹混合，为高效扩散模型训练提供了新方向，并揭示了最优传输（OT）对扩散训练的潜在作用。

Abstract: The substantial training cost of diffusion models hinders their deployment.
Immiscible Diffusion recently showed that reducing diffusion trajectory mixing
in the noise space via linear assignment accelerates training by simplifying
denoising. To extend immiscible diffusion beyond the inefficient linear
assignment under high batch sizes and high dimensions, we refine this concept
to a broader miscibility reduction at any layer and by any implementation.
Specifically, we empirically demonstrate the bijective nature of the denoising
process with respect to immiscible diffusion, ensuring its preservation of
generative diversity. Moreover, we provide thorough analysis and show
step-by-step how immiscibility eases denoising and improves efficiency.
Extending beyond linear assignment, we propose a family of implementations
including K-nearest neighbor (KNN) noise selection and image scaling to reduce
miscibility, achieving up to >4x faster training across diverse models and
tasks including unconditional/conditional generation, image editing, and
robotics planning. Furthermore, our analysis of immiscibility offers a novel
perspective on how optimal transport (OT) enhances diffusion training. By
identifying trajectory miscibility as a fundamental bottleneck, we believe this
work establishes a potentially new direction for future research into
high-efficiency diffusion training. The code is available at

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis and treatment
but is challenged by high-dimensional data and complex spatial dependencies.
Traditional single-modality networks, such as CNNs and Transformers, are often
limited by computational inefficiency and constrained contextual modeling in 3D
settings. We introduce a novel multimodal framework that leverages Mamba and
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an efficient backbone for long-sequence
modeling. Our approach features three key innovations: First, an EGSC (Enhanced
Gated Spatial Convolution) module captures spatial information when unfolding
3D images into 1D sequences. Second, we extend Group-Rational KAN (GR-KAN), a
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks variant with rational basis functions, into
3D-Group-Rational KAN (3D-GR-KAN) for 3D medical imaging - its first
application in this domain - enabling superior feature representation tailored
to volumetric data. Third, a dual-branch text-driven strategy leverages CLIP's
text embeddings: one branch swaps one-hot labels for semantic vectors to
preserve inter-organ semantic relationships, while the other aligns images with
detailed organ descriptions to enhance semantic alignment. Experiments on the
Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) and KiTS23 datasets show our method
achieving state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in
accuracy and efficiency. This work highlights the power of combining advanced
sequence modeling, extended network architectures, and vision-language synergy

Conclusion: DiTF有效解决了DiTs的大规模激活问题，提升了其在视觉对应任务中的表现。

Abstract: Pre-trained stable diffusion models (SD) have shown great advances in visual
correspondence. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) for accurate dense correspondence. Distinct from SD, DiTs
exhibit a critical phenomenon in which very few feature activations exhibit
significantly larger values than others, known as \textit{massive activations},
leading to uninformative representations and significant performance
degradation for DiTs. The massive activations consistently concentrate at very
few fixed dimensions across all image patch tokens, holding little local
information. We trace these dimension-concentrated massive activations and find
that such concentration can be effectively localized by the zero-initialized
Adaptive Layer Norm (AdaLN-zero). Building on these findings, we propose
Diffusion Transformer Feature (DiTF), a training-free framework designed to
extract semantic-discriminative features from DiTs. Specifically, DiTF employs
AdaLN to adaptively localize and normalize massive activations with
channel-wise modulation. In addition, we develop a channel discard strategy to
further eliminate the negative impacts from massive activations. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DiTF outperforms both DINO and SD-based models and
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance for DiTs in different visual
correspondence tasks (\eg, with +9.4\% on Spair-71k and +4.4\% on AP-10K-C.S.).

Abstract: Vision-language retrieval (VLR) has attracted significant attention in both
academia and industry, which involves using text (or images) as queries to
retrieve corresponding images (or text). However, existing methods often
neglect the rich visual semantics knowledge of entities, thus leading to
incorrect retrieval results. To address this problem, we propose the Entity
Visual Description enhanced CLIP (EvdCLIP), designed to leverage the visual
knowledge of entities to enrich queries. Specifically, since humans recognize
entities through visual cues, we employ a large language model (LLM) to
generate Entity Visual Descriptions (EVDs) as alignment cues to complement
textual data. These EVDs are then integrated into raw queries to create
visually-rich, EVD-enhanced queries. Furthermore, recognizing that EVD-enhanced
queries may introduce noise or low-quality expansions, we develop a novel,
trainable EVD-aware Rewriter (EaRW) for vision-language retrieval tasks. EaRW
utilizes EVD knowledge and the generative capabilities of the language model to
effectively rewrite queries. With our specialized training strategy, EaRW can
generate high-quality and low-noise EVD-enhanced queries. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments on image-text retrieval benchmarks
validate the superiority of EvdCLIP on vision-language retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize images of
user-provided concepts in diverse contexts. Despite recent progress in
multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle
to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun
exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they
require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and
prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a
novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively
customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our
method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pretrained Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful
properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module,
Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the
modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It incorporates
vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into
the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused
by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we
introduce a VLM-guided pretraining strategy that leverages the strong image
understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic
supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard
benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, supported by
quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has excelled in novel view synthesis
(NVS) with its real-time rendering capabilities and superior quality. However,
it encounters challenges for high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) due
to the coarse nature of primitives derived from low-resolution input views. To
address this issue, we propose SuperGS, an expansion of Scaffold-GS designed
with a two-stage coarse-to-fine training framework. In the low-resolution
stage, we introduce a latent feature field to represent the low-resolution
scene, which serves as both the initialization and foundational information for
super-resolution optimization. In the high-resolution stage, we propose a
multi-view consistent densification strategy that backprojects high-resolution
depth maps based on error maps and employs a multi-view voting mechanism,
mitigating ambiguities caused by multi-view inconsistencies in the pseudo
labels provided by 2D prior models while avoiding Gaussian redundancy.
Furthermore, we model uncertainty through variational feature learning and use
it to guide further scene representation refinement and adjust the supervisory
effect of pseudo-labels, ensuring consistent and detailed scene reconstruction.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGS outperforms state-of-the-art
HRNVS methods on both forward-facing and 360-degree datasets.

Conclusion: ProphetDWM通过联合学习动作动态和状态，显著提升了驾驶世界模型的预测能力。

Abstract: Real-world driving requires people to observe the current environment,
anticipate the future, and make appropriate driving decisions. This requirement
is aligned well with the capabilities of world models, which understand the
environment and predict the future. However, recent world models in autonomous
driving are built explicitly, where they could predict the future by
controllable driving video generation. We argue that driving world models
should have two additional abilities: action control and action prediction.
Following this line, previous methods are limited because they predict the
video requires given actions of the same length as the video and ignore the
dynamical action laws. To address these issues, we propose ProphetDWM, a novel
end-to-end driving world model that jointly predicts future videos and actions.
Our world model has an action module to learn latent action from the present to
the future period by giving the action sequence and observations. And a
diffusion-model-based transition module to learn the state distribution. The
model is jointly trained by learning latent actions given finite states and
predicting action and video. The joint learning connects the action dynamics
and states and enables long-term future prediction. We evaluate our method in
video generation and action prediction tasks on the Nuscenes dataset. Compared
to the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves the best video consistency
and best action prediction accuracy, while also enabling high-quality long-term
video and action generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-powered generative models have enabled the creation of
increasingly realistic synthetic images, posing significant risks to
information integrity and public trust on social media platforms. While robust
detection frameworks and diverse, large-scale datasets are essential to
mitigate these risks, existing academic efforts remain limited in scope:
current datasets lack the diversity, scale, and realism required for social
media contexts, while detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen
generative technologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce So-Fake-Set, a
comprehensive social media-oriented dataset with over 2 million high-quality
images, diverse generative sources, and photorealistic imagery synthesized
using 35 state-of-the-art generative models. To rigorously evaluate
cross-domain robustness, we establish a novel and large-scale (100K)
out-of-domain benchmark (So-Fake-OOD) featuring synthetic imagery from
commercial models explicitly excluded from the training distribution, creating
a realistic testbed for evaluating real-world performance. Leveraging these
resources, we present So-Fake-R1, an advanced vision-language framework that
employs reinforcement learning for highly accurate forgery detection, precise
localization, and explainable inference through interpretable visual
rationales. Extensive experiments show that So-Fake-R1 outperforms the
second-best method, with a 1.3% gain in detection accuracy and a 4.5% increase
in localization IoU. By integrating a scalable dataset, a challenging OOD
benchmark, and an advanced detection framework, this work establishes a new
foundation for social media-centric forgery detection research. The code,

Abstract: Image Restoration (IR) aims to recover high quality images from degraded
inputs affected by various corruptions such as noise, blur, haze, rain, and low
light conditions. Despite recent advances, most existing approaches treat IR as
a direct mapping problem, relying on shared representations across degradation
types without modeling their structural diversity. In this work, we present
MIRAGE, a unified and lightweight framework for all in one IR that explicitly
decomposes the input feature space into three semantically aligned parallel
branches, each processed by a specialized module attention for global context,
convolution for local textures, and MLP for channel-wise statistics. This
modular decomposition significantly improves generalization and efficiency
across diverse degradations. Furthermore, we introduce a cross layer
contrastive learning scheme that aligns shallow and latent features to enhance
the discriminability of shared representations. To better capture the
underlying geometry of feature representations, we perform contrastive learning
in a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold space rather than the
conventional Euclidean space. Extensive experiments show that MIRAGE not only
achieves new state of the art performance across a variety of degradation types
but also offers a scalable solution for challenging all-in-one IR scenarios.

applications. Despite significant progress in text-driven image editing, there
is limited work focusing on understanding users' emotional requests. In this
paper, we introduce AIEdiT for Affective Image Editing using Text descriptions,
which evokes specific emotions by adaptively shaping multiple emotional factors
across the entire images. To represent universal emotional priors, we build the
continuous emotional spectrum and extract nuanced emotional requests. To
manipulate emotional factors, we design the emotional mapper to translate
visually-abstract emotional requests to visually-concrete semantic
representations. To ensure that editing results evoke specific emotions, we
introduce an MLLM to supervise the model training. During inference, we
strategically distort visual elements and subsequently shape corresponding
emotional factors to edit images according to users' instructions.
Additionally, we introduce a large-scale dataset that includes the
emotion-aligned text and image pair set for training and evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AIEdiT achieves superior performance, effectively
reflecting users' emotional requests.

Conclusion: MSLAU-Net是一种高效、鲁棒的医学图像分割方法。

Abstract: Both CNN-based and Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable success
in medical image segmentation tasks. However, CNN-based methods struggle to
effectively capture global contextual information due to the inherent
limitations of convolution operations. Meanwhile, Transformer-based methods
suffer from insufficient local feature modeling and face challenges related to
the high computational complexity caused by the self-attention mechanism. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid CNN-Transformer
architecture, named MSLAU-Net, which integrates the strengths of both
paradigms. The proposed MSLAU-Net incorporates two key ideas. First, it
introduces Multi-Scale Linear Attention, designed to efficiently extract
multi-scale features from medical images while modeling long-range dependencies
with low computational complexity. Second, it adopts a top-down feature
aggregation mechanism, which performs multi-level feature aggregation and
restores spatial resolution using a lightweight structure. Extensive
experiments conducted on benchmark datasets covering three imaging modalities
demonstrate that the proposed MSLAU-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods on nearly all evaluation metrics, validating the superiority,
effectiveness, and robustness of our approach. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 大规模多模态预训练和图像预处理对3D感知至关重要，DeepTumorVQA为医学多模态研究提供了严格基准。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in various 2D visual tasks,
yet their readiness for 3D clinical diagnosis remains unclear due to stringent
demands for recognition precision, reasoning ability, and domain knowledge. To
systematically evaluate these dimensions, we present DeepTumorVQA, a diagnostic
visual question answering (VQA) benchmark targeting abdominal tumors in CT
scans. It comprises 9,262 CT volumes (3.7M slices) from 17 public datasets,
with 395K expert-level questions spanning four categories: Recognition,
Measurement, Visual Reasoning, and Medical Reasoning. DeepTumorVQA introduces
unique challenges, including small tumor detection and clinical reasoning
across 3D anatomy. Benchmarking four advanced VLMs (RadFM, M3D, Merlin,
CT-CHAT), we find current models perform adequately on measurement tasks but
struggle with lesion recognition and reasoning, and are still not meeting
clinical needs. Two key insights emerge: (1) large-scale multimodal pretraining
plays a crucial role in DeepTumorVQA testing performance, making RadFM stand
out among all VLMs. (2) Our dataset exposes critical differences in VLM
components, where proper image preprocessing and design of vision modules
significantly affect 3D perception. To facilitate medical multimodal research,
we have released DeepTumorVQA as a rigorous benchmark:

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上表现优异，L2误差降低0.04米，碰撞率减少0.12%，且无需额外监督。

Conclusion: Echo Planning为安全关键型自动驾驶系统提供了一种可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems suffer from a critical
limitation: their planners lack mechanisms to enforce temporal consistency
between predicted trajectories and evolving scene dynamics. This absence of
self-supervision allows early prediction errors to compound catastrophically
over time. We introduce Echo Planning, a novel self-correcting framework that
establishes a closed-loop Current - Future - Current (CFC) cycle to harmonize
trajectory prediction with scene coherence. Our key insight is that plausible
future trajectories must be bi-directionally consistent, ie, not only generated
from current observations but also capable of reconstructing them. The CFC
mechanism first predicts future trajectories from the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)
scene representation, then inversely maps these trajectories back to estimate
the current BEV state. By enforcing consistency between the original and
reconstructed BEV representations through a cycle loss, the framework
intrinsically penalizes physically implausible or misaligned trajectories.
Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing L2
error by 0.04 m and collision rate by 0.12% compared to one-shot planners.
Crucially, our method requires no additional supervision, leveraging the CFC
cycle as an inductive bias for robust planning. This work offers a deployable
solution for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Existing methods struggle with generalization, performing well on closed-set

open-vocabulary instructions. We introduce OpenHOI, the first framework for

integrates a 3D Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) fine-tuned for joint
affordance grounding and semantic task decomposition, enabling precise
localization of interaction regions (e.g., handles, buttons) and breakdown of
complex instructions (e.g., "Find a water bottle and take a sip") into
executable sub-tasks. To synthesize physically plausible interactions, we
propose an affordance-driven diffusion model paired with a training-free
physics refinement stage that minimizes penetration and optimizes affordance
alignment. Evaluations across diverse scenarios demonstrate OpenHOI's
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to novel object
categories, multi-stage tasks, and complex language instructions. Our project

Abstract: Current perception models have achieved remarkable success by leveraging
large-scale labeled datasets, but still face challenges in open-world
environments with novel objects. To address this limitation, researchers
introduce open-set perception models to detect or segment arbitrary test-time
user-input categories. However, open-set models rely on human involvement to
provide predefined object categories as input during inference. More recently,
researchers have framed a more realistic and challenging task known as
open-ended perception that aims to discover unseen objects without requiring
any category-level input from humans at inference time. Nevertheless,
open-ended models suffer from low performance compared to open-set models. In
this paper, we present VL-SAM-V2, an open-world object detection framework that
is capable of discovering unseen objects while achieving favorable performance.
To achieve this, we combine queries from open-set and open-ended models and
propose a general and specific query fusion module to allow different queries
to interact. By adjusting queries from open-set models, we enable VL-SAM-V2 to
be evaluated in the open-set or open-ended mode. In addition, to learn more
diverse queries, we introduce ranked learnable queries to match queries with
proposals from open-ended models by sorting. Moreover, we design a denoising
point training strategy to facilitate the training process. Experimental
results on LVIS show that our method surpasses the previous open-set and
open-ended methods, especially on rare objects.

Conclusion: 研究结论表明，输出多样性和架构设计比单纯增加深度对点云重建更关键。

Abstract: We challenge the common assumption that deeper decoder architectures always
yield better performance in point cloud reconstruction. Our analysis reveals
that, beyond a certain depth, increasing decoder complexity leads to
overfitting and degraded generalization. Additionally, we propose a novel
multi-head decoder architecture that exploits the inherent redundancy in point
clouds by reconstructing complete shapes from multiple independent heads, each
operating on a distinct subset of points. The final output is obtained by
concatenating the predictions from all heads, enhancing both diversity and
fidelity. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart demonstrate that
our approach achieves consistent improvements across key metrics--including
Chamfer Distance (CD), Hausdorff Distance (HD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD),
and F1-score--outperforming standard single-head baselines. Our findings
highlight that output diversity and architectural design can be more critical
than depth alone for effective and efficient point cloud reconstruction.

Conclusion: OmniPainter高效且实用，适用于大规模扩散模型。

Abstract: Although diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities,
existing methods for stylized image generation based on these models often

time-consuming and limits the practical applicability of large-scale diffusion
models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel stylized image
generation method leveraging a pre-trained large-scale diffusion model without
requiring fine-tuning or any additional optimization, termed as OmniPainter.
Specifically, we exploit the self-consistency property of latent consistency
models to extract the representative style statistics from reference style
images to guide the stylization process. Additionally, we then introduce the
norm mixture of self-attention, which enables the model to query the most
relevant style patterns from these statistics for the intermediate output
content features. This mechanism also ensures that the stylized results align
closely with the distribution of the reference style images. Our qualitative
and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Face swapping, recognized as a privacy and security concern, has prompted
considerable defensive research. With the advancements in AI-generated content,
the discrepancies between the real and swapped faces have become nuanced.
Considering the difficulty of forged traces detection, we shift the focus to
the face swapping purpose and proactively embed elaborate watermarks against
unknown face swapping techniques. Given that the constant purpose is to swap
the original face identity while preserving the background, we concentrate on
the regions surrounding the face to ensure robust watermark generation, while
embedding the contour texture and face identity information to achieve
progressive image determination. The watermark is located in the facial contour
and contains hybrid messages, dubbed the contour-hybrid watermark (CMark). Our
approach generalizes face swapping detection without requiring any swapping
techniques during training and the storage of large-scale messages in advance.
Experiments conducted across 8 face swapping techniques demonstrate the
superiority of our approach compared with state-of-the-art passive and
proactive detectors while achieving a favorable balance between the image
quality and watermark robustness.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have significantly accelerated
image editing techniques, driving increasing demand for diverse and
fine-grained edits. Despite these advances, existing image editing methods
still face challenges in achieving high precision and semantic accuracy in
complex scenarios. Recent studies address this issue by incorporating
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into image editing pipelines. However,
current MLLM-based methods mainly rely on interpreting textual instructions,
leaving the intrinsic visual understanding of large models largely unexplored,
thus resulting in insufficient alignment between textual semantics and visual
outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose MIND-Edit, an end-to-end
image-editing framework integrating pretrained diffusion model with MLLM.
MIND-Edit introduces two complementary strategies: (1) a text instruction
optimization strategy that clarifies ambiguous user instructions based on
semantic reasoning from the MLLM, and (2) an MLLM insight-driven editing
strategy that explicitly leverages the intrinsic visual understanding
capability of the MLLM to infer editing intent and guide the diffusion process
via generated visual embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a joint training
approach to effectively integrate both strategies, allowing them to reinforce
each other for more accurate instruction interpretation and visually coherent
edits aligned with user intent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MIND-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods in both
quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly under complex and
challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Scene understanding based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently
achieved notable advances. Although 3DGS related methods have efficient
rendering capabilities, they fail to address the inherent contradiction between
the anisotropic color representation of gaussian primitives and the isotropic
requirements of semantic features, leading to insufficient cross-view feature
consistency. To overcome the limitation, we proposes $\textit{FHGS}$
(Feature-Homogenized Gaussian Splatting), a novel 3D feature fusion framework
inspired by physical models, which can achieve high-precision mapping of
arbitrary 2D features from pre-trained models to 3D scenes while preserving the
real-time rendering efficiency of 3DGS. Specifically, our $\textit{FHGS}$
introduces the following innovations: Firstly, a universal feature fusion
architecture is proposed, enabling robust embedding of large-scale pre-trained
models' semantic features (e.g., SAM, CLIP) into sparse 3D structures.
Secondly, a non-differentiable feature fusion mechanism is introduced, which
enables semantic features to exhibit viewpoint independent isotropic
distributions. This fundamentally balances the anisotropic rendering of
gaussian primitives and the isotropic expression of features; Thirdly, a
dual-driven optimization strategy inspired by electric potential fields is
proposed, which combines external supervision from semantic feature fields with
internal primitive clustering guidance. This mechanism enables synergistic
optimization of global semantic alignment and local structural consistency.

Abstract: Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) is crucial for agricultural semantic
segmentation. However, Cloud contamination introduces time gaps in SITS,
disrupting temporal dependencies and causing feature shifts, leading to
degraded performance of models trained on complete SITS. Existing methods
typically address this by reconstructing the entire SITS before prediction or
using data augmentation to simulate missing data. Yet, full reconstruction may
introduce noise and redundancy, while the data-augmented model can only handle
limited missing patterns, leading to poor generalization. We propose a joint
learning framework with feature reconstruction and prediction to address
incomplete SITS more effectively. During training, we simulate data-missing
scenarios using temporal masks. The two tasks are guided by both ground-truth
labels and the teacher model trained on complete SITS. The prediction task
constrains the model from selectively reconstructing critical features from
masked inputs that align with the teacher's temporal feature representations.
It reduces unnecessary reconstruction and limits noise propagation. By
integrating reconstructed features into the prediction task, the model avoids
learning shortcuts and maintains its ability to handle varied missing patterns
and complete SITS. Experiments on SITS from Hunan Province, Western France, and
Catalonia show that our method improves mean F1-scores by 6.93% in cropland
extraction and 7.09% in crop classification over baselines. It also generalizes
well across satellite sensors, including Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope, under
varying temporal missing rates and model backbones.

Abstract: Segmentation is one of the most important tasks in the medical imaging
pipeline as it influences a number of image-based decisions. To be effective,
fully supervised segmentation approaches require large amounts of manually
annotated training data. However, the pixel-level annotation process is
expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, hindering progress and making it
challenging to perform effective segmentations. Therefore, models must learn
efficiently from limited labeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL),
particularly contrastive learning via pre-training on unlabeled data and
fine-tuning on limited annotations, can facilitate such limited labeled image
segmentation. To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised contrastive
learning framework for medical image segmentation, leveraging inherent
relationships of different images, dubbed PolyCL. Without requiring any
pixel-level annotations or unreasonable data augmentations, our PolyCL learns
and transfers context-aware discriminant features useful for segmentation from
an innovative surrogate, in a task-related manner. Additionally, we integrate
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our framework in two novel ways: as a
post-processing refinement module that improves the accuracy of predicted masks
using bounding box prompts derived from coarse outputs, and as a propagation
mechanism via SAM 2 that generates volumetric segmentations from a single
annotated 2D slice. Experimental evaluations on three public computed
tomography (CT) datasets demonstrate that PolyCL outperforms fully-supervised
and self-supervised baselines in both low-data and cross-domain scenarios. Our

TL;DR: 论文提出AdViSe方法，利用预训练图像基础模型（IFMs）进行视频自监督学习，显著降低训练开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频自监督学习通常需要大量计算资源，而预训练IFMs的潜力未被充分利用。

Method: 在IFMs中引入时间建模模块（ResNet3D），采用播放速率感知的自监督学习方法训练时间模块，冻结IFMs部分。

Result: 在UCF101上，AdViSe性能接近SOTA，训练时间减少3.4倍，GPU内存使用减少8.2倍。

Conclusion: AdViSe为基于预训练IFMs的低成本视频自监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the past decade, image foundation models (IFMs) have achieved
unprecedented progress. However, the potential of directly using IFMs for video
self-supervised representation learning has largely been overlooked. In this
study, we propose an advancing video self-supervised learning (AdViSe)
approach, aimed at significantly reducing the training overhead of video
representation models using pre-trained IFMs. Specifically, we first introduce
temporal modeling modules (ResNet3D) to IFMs, constructing a video
representation model. We then employ a video self-supervised learning approach,
playback rate perception, to train temporal modules while freezing the IFM
components. Experiments on UCF101 demonstrate that AdViSe achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing training time by
$3.4\times$ and GPU memory usage by $8.2\times$. This study offers fresh
insights into low-cost video self-supervised learning based on pre-trained
IFMs. Code is available at https://github.com/JingwWu/advise-video-ssl.

Abstract: Data-driven learning has advanced autonomous driving, yet task-specific
models struggle with out-of-distribution scenarios due to their narrow
optimization objectives and reliance on costly annotated data. We present
DriveX, a self-supervised world model that learns generalizable scene dynamics
and holistic representations (geometric, semantic, and motion) from large-scale
driving videos. DriveX introduces Omni Scene Modeling (OSM), a module that
unifies multimodal supervision-3D point cloud forecasting, 2D semantic
representation, and image generation-to capture comprehensive scene evolution.
To simplify learning complex dynamics, we propose a decoupled latent world
modeling strategy that separates world representation learning from future
state decoding, augmented by dynamic-aware ray sampling to enhance motion
modeling. For downstream adaptation, we design Future Spatial Attention (FSA),
a unified paradigm that dynamically aggregates spatiotemporal features from
DriveX's predictions to enhance task-specific inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DriveX's effectiveness: it achieves significant improvements in 3D
future point cloud prediction over prior work, while attaining state-of-the-art
results on diverse tasks including occupancy prediction, flow estimation, and
end-to-end driving. These results validate DriveX's capability as a
general-purpose world model, paving the way for robust and unified autonomous

Abstract: Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, aimed at

segmentation extends this task by using natural language expressions to
localize specific objects, requiring effective integration of visual and

geometric adaptability, and residual connections for deep feature learning. We
also introduce a novel referring-aware fusion (RAF) loss that balances
region-level alignment, boundary precision, and class imbalance. Extensive

consistent performance improvements. SegVLM also shows strong generalization
across diverse datasets and referring expression scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法为通用SFT数据集的构建提供了高效解决方案，并公开了数据集和模型权重。

Abstract: Pre-training equips text-to-image (T2I) models with broad world knowledge,
but this alone is often insufficient to achieve high aesthetic quality and
alignment. Consequently, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is crucial for further
refinement. However, its effectiveness highly depends on the quality of the
fine-tuning dataset. Existing public SFT datasets frequently target narrow
domains (e.g., anime or specific art styles), and the creation of high-quality,
general-purpose SFT datasets remains a significant challenge. Current curation
methods are often costly and struggle to identify truly impactful samples. This
challenge is further complicated by the scarcity of public general-purpose
datasets, as leading models often rely on large, proprietary, and poorly
documented internal data, hindering broader research progress. This paper
introduces a novel methodology for creating general-purpose SFT datasets by
leveraging a pre-trained generative model as an estimator of high-impact
training samples. We apply this methodology to construct and release Alchemist,
a compact (3,350 samples) yet highly effective SFT dataset. Experiments
demonstrate that Alchemist substantially improves the generative quality of
five public T2I models while preserving diversity and style. Additionally, we
release the fine-tuned models' weights to the public.

Abstract: Current text-driven image editing methods typically follow one of two
directions: relying on large-scale, high-quality editing pair datasets to
improve editing precision and diversity, or exploring alternative dataset-free
techniques. However, constructing large-scale editing datasets requires
carefully designed pipelines, is time-consuming, and often results in
unrealistic samples or unwanted artifacts. Meanwhile, dataset-free methods may
suffer from limited instruction comprehension and restricted editing
capabilities. Faced with these challenges, the present work develops a novel
paradigm for instruction-driven image editing that leverages widely available
and enormous text-image pairs, instead of relying on editing pair datasets. Our
approach introduces a multi-scale learnable region to localize and guide the
editing process. By treating the alignment between images and their textual
descriptions as supervision and learning to generate task-specific editing
regions, our method achieves high-fidelity, precise, and instruction-consistent
image editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
attains state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and benchmarks, while
exhibiting strong adaptability to various types of generative models.

Conclusion: 全局绝对坐标表示是一种高效且可扩展的文本到运动生成方案，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-motion generation models rely on the
kinematic-aware, local-relative motion representation popularized by HumanML3D,
which encodes motion relative to the pelvis and to the previous frame with
built-in redundancy. While this design simplifies training for earlier
generation models, it introduces critical limitations for diffusion models and
hinders applicability to downstream tasks. In this work, we revisit the motion
representation and propose a radically simplified and long-abandoned
alternative for text-to-motion generation: absolute joint coordinates in global
space. Through systematic analysis of design choices, we show that this
formulation achieves significantly higher motion fidelity, improved text
alignment, and strong scalability, even with a simple Transformer backbone and
no auxiliary kinematic-aware losses. Moreover, our formulation naturally
supports downstream tasks such as text-driven motion control and
temporal/spatial editing without additional task-specific reengineering and
costly classifier guidance generation from control signals. Finally, we
demonstrate promising generalization to directly generate SMPL-H mesh vertices
in motion from text, laying a strong foundation for future research and
motion-related applications.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating high-quality and diverse visual content from natural language
prompts. However, uncontrolled reproduction of sensitive, copyrighted, or
harmful imagery poses serious ethical, legal, and safety challenges. To address
these concerns, the concept erasure paradigm has emerged as a promising
direction, enabling the selective removal of specific semantic concepts from
generative models while preserving their overall utility. This survey provides
a comprehensive overview and in-depth synthesis of concept erasure techniques
in T2I diffusion models. We systematically categorize existing approaches along
three key dimensions: intervention level, which identifies specific model
components targeted for concept removal; optimization structure, referring to
the algorithmic strategies employed to achieve suppression; and semantic scope,
concerning the complexity and nature of the concepts addressed. This
multi-dimensional taxonomy enables clear, structured comparisons across diverse
methodologies, highlighting fundamental trade-offs between erasure specificity,
generalization, and computational complexity. We further discuss current
evaluation benchmarks, standardized metrics, and practical datasets,
emphasizing gaps that limit comprehensive assessment, particularly regarding
robustness and practical effectiveness. Finally, we outline major challenges
and promising future directions, including disentanglement of concept
representations, adaptive and incremental erasure strategies, adversarial
robustness, and new generative architectures. This survey aims to guide
researchers toward safer, more ethically aligned generative models, providing
foundational knowledge and actionable recommendations to advance responsible

Abstract: We present LlamaSeg, a visual autoregressive framework that unifies multiple
image segmentation tasks via natural language instructions. We reformulate
image segmentation as a visual generation problem, representing masks as
"visual" tokens and employing a LLaMA-style Transformer to predict them
directly from image inputs. By adhering to the next-token prediction paradigm,
our approach naturally integrates segmentation tasks into autoregressive
architectures. To support large-scale training, we introduce a data annotation
pipeline and construct the SA-OVRS dataset, which contains 2M segmentation
masks annotated with over 5,800 open-vocabulary labels or diverse textual
descriptions, covering a wide spectrum of real-world scenarios. This enables
our model to localize objects in images based on text prompts and to generate
fine-grained masks. To more accurately evaluate the quality of masks produced
by visual generative models, we further propose a composite metric that
combines Intersection over Union (IoU) with Average Hausdorff Distance (AHD),
offering a more precise assessment of contour fidelity. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method surpasses existing generative models across
multiple datasets and yields more detailed segmentation masks.

Abstract: Video action understanding tasks in real-world scenarios always suffer data
limitations. In this paper, we address the data-limited action understanding
problem by bridging data scarcity. We propose a novel method that employs a
text-to-video diffusion transformer to generate annotated data for model
training. This paradigm enables the generation of realistic annotated data on
an infinite scale without human intervention. We proposed the information
enhancement strategy and the uncertainty-based label smoothing tailored to
generate sample training. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we
observed that real samples generally contain a richer level of information than
generated samples. Based on this observation, the information enhancement
strategy is proposed to enhance the informative content of the generated
samples from two aspects: the environments and the characters. Furthermore, we
observed that some low-quality generated samples might negatively affect model
training. To address this, we devised the uncertainty-based label smoothing
strategy to increase the smoothing of these samples, thus reducing their
impact. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on four
datasets across five tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance for
zero-shot action recognition.

Conclusion: 新方法有效控制了分布漂移，提升了模型在个性化任务中的表现。

Abstract: Personalization using text-to-image diffusion models involves adapting a
pretrained model to novel subjects with only a few image examples. This task
presents a fundamental challenge, as the model must not only learn the new
subject effectively but also preserve its ability to generate diverse and
coherent outputs across a wide range of prompts. In other words, successful
personalization requires integrating new concepts without forgetting previously
learned generative capabilities. Forgetting denotes unintended distributional
drift, where the model's output distribution deviates from that of the original
pretrained model. In this paper, we provide an analysis of this issue and
identify a mismatch between standard training objectives and the goals of
personalization. To address this, we propose a new training objective based on
a Lipschitz-bounded formulation that explicitly constrains deviation from the
pretrained distribution. Our method provides improved control over
distributional drift and performs well even in data-scarce scenarios.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing personalization methods, achieving higher CLIP-T, CLIP-I, and DINO
scores.

video quality, editing alignment, and structural consistency. Based on TDVE-DB,
we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation for the 12 state-of-the-art editing
models revealing the strengths and weaknesses of current video techniques, and
then benchmark existing VQA methods in the context of text-driven video editing
evaluation. Building on these insights, we propose TDVE-Assessor, a novel VQA

TDVE-Assessor integrates both spatial and temporal video features into a large

Abstract: Open vocabulary image segmentation tackles the challenge of recognizing
dynamically adjustable, predefined novel categories at inference time by
leveraging vision-language alignment. However, existing paradigms typically
perform class-agnostic region segmentation followed by category matching, which
deviates from the human visual system's process of recognizing objects based on
semantic concepts, leading to poor alignment between region segmentation and
target concepts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Cognition-Inspired
Framework for open vocabulary image segmentation that emulates the human visual
recognition process: first forming a conceptual understanding of an object,
then perceiving its spatial extent. The framework consists of three core
components: (1) A Generative Vision-Language Model (G-VLM) that mimics human
cognition by generating object concepts to provide semantic guidance for region
segmentation. (2) A Concept-Aware Visual Enhancer Module that fuses textual
concept features with global visual representations, enabling adaptive visual
perception based on target concepts. (3) A Cognition-Inspired Decoder that
integrates local instance features with G-VLM-provided semantic cues, allowing
selective classification over a subset of relevant categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements,
reaching $27.2$ PQ, $17.0$ mAP, and $35.3$ mIoU on A-150. It further attains
$56.2$, $28.2$, $15.4$, $59.2$, $18.7$, and $95.8$ mIoU on Cityscapes,
Mapillary Vistas, A-847, PC-59, PC-459, and PAS-20, respectively. In addition,
our framework supports vocabulary-free segmentation, offering enhanced
flexibility in recognizing unseen categories. Code will be public.

Abstract: Securing personal identity against deepfake attacks is increasingly critical
in the digital age, especially for celebrities and political figures whose
faces are easily accessible and frequently targeted. Most existing deepfake
detection methods focus on general-purpose scenarios and often ignore the
valuable prior knowledge of known facial identities, e.g., "VIP individuals"
whose authentic facial data are already available. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{VIPGuard}, a unified multimodal framework designed to capture
fine-grained and comprehensive facial representations of a given identity,
compare them against potentially fake or similar-looking faces, and reason over
these comparisons to make accurate and explainable predictions. Specifically,
our framework consists of three main stages. First, fine-tune a multimodal
large language model (MLLM) to learn detailed and structural facial attributes.
Second, we perform identity-level discriminative learning to enable the model
to distinguish subtle differences between highly similar faces, including real
and fake variations. Finally, we introduce user-specific customization, where
we model the unique characteristics of the target face identity and perform
semantic reasoning via MLLM to enable personalized and explainable deepfake
detection. Our framework shows clear advantages over previous detection works,
where traditional detectors mainly rely on low-level visual cues and provide no
human-understandable explanations, while other MLLM-based models often lack a
detailed understanding of specific face identities. To facilitate the
evaluation of our method, we built a comprehensive identity-aware benchmark
called \textbf{VIPBench} for personalized deepfake detection, involving the
latest 7 face-swapping and 7 entire face synthesis techniques for generation.

Abstract: Multimodal information retrieval (MIR) faces inherent challenges due to the

While previous studies have identified modal gaps in feature spaces, a
systematic approach to address these challenges remains unexplored. In this

through two critical yet underexplored aspects: data curation and
modality-aware training configurations. Our work provides the first
comprehensive analysis of how modality-specific data properties influence
downstream task performance across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we propose
Modal-Aware Masked Contrastive Learning (MAMCL) to mitigate the competitive
relationships among the instances of different modalities. Our framework
achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks,
outperforming existing methods by notable margins. Through extensive

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are gaining traction in the visual generative area
for their efficiency and compatibility. However, the pioneered attempts still
fall behind the continuous counterparts, which we attribute to the noise
(absorbing state) design and sampling heuristics. In this study, we propose the
rehashing noise framework for discrete diffusion transformer, termed ReDDiT, to
extend absorbing states and improve expressive capacity of discrete diffusion
models. ReDDiT enriches the potential paths that latent variables can traverse
during training with randomized multi-index corruption. The derived rehash
sampler, which reverses the randomized absorbing paths, guarantees the
diversity and low discrepancy of the generation process. These reformulations
lead to more consistent and competitive generation quality, mitigating the need
for heavily tuned randomness. Experiments show that ReDDiT significantly
outperforms the baseline (reducing gFID from 6.18 to 1.61) and is on par with
the continuous counterparts with higher efficiency.

Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在不同域中泛化能力差，现有方法（如表示学习和数据增强）各有局限，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 利用对比散度训练的能量模型（EBMs）生成中间样本，通过Langevin动态实现数据增强。

Result: LangDAug在多源域泛化任务中表现优于现有方法，并能补充现有域随机化方法。

Conclusion: LangDAug通过理论分析和实验验证，为医学图像分割的域泛化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models often struggle to generalize across
different domains due to various reasons. Domain Generalization (DG) methods
overcome this either through representation learning or data augmentation
(DAug). While representation learning methods seek domain-invariant features,
they often rely on ad-hoc techniques and lack formal guarantees. DAug methods,
which enrich model representations through synthetic samples, have shown
comparable or superior performance to representation learning approaches. We
propose LangDAug, a novel $\textbf{Lang}$evin $\textbf{D}$ata
$\textbf{Aug}$mentation for multi-source domain generalization in 2D medical
image segmentation. LangDAug leverages Energy-Based Models (EBMs) trained via
contrastive divergence to traverse between source domains, generating
intermediate samples through Langevin dynamics. Theoretical analysis shows that
LangDAug induces a regularization effect, and for GLMs, it upper-bounds the
Rademacher complexity by the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold.
Through extensive experiments on Fundus segmentation and 2D MRI prostate
segmentation benchmarks, we show that LangDAug outperforms state-of-the-art
domain generalization methods and effectively complements existing
domain-randomization approaches. The codebase for our method is available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进注意力机制和特征聚合，显著提升了多图像超分辨率的质量。

Abstract: Multi-image super-resolution (MISR) can achieve higher image quality than
single-image super-resolution (SISR) by aggregating sub-pixel information from
multiple spatially shifted frames. Among MISR tasks, burst super-resolution
(BurstSR) has gained significant attention due to its wide range of
applications. Recent methods have increasingly adopted Transformers over
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in super-resolution tasks, due to their
superior ability to capture both local and global context. However, most
existing approaches still rely on fixed and narrow attention windows that
restrict the perception of features beyond the local field. This limitation
hampers alignment and feature aggregation, both of which are crucial for
high-quality super-resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
feature extractor that incorporates two newly designed attention mechanisms:
overlapping cross-window attention and cross-frame attention, enabling more
precise and efficient extraction of sub-pixel information across multiple
frames. Furthermore, we introduce a Multi-scan State-Space Module with the
cross-frame attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of our approach. Additional evaluations on ISO 12233 resolution
test charts further confirm its enhanced super-resolution performance.

Abstract: Camera sensor simulation serves as a critical role for autonomous driving
(AD), e.g. evaluating vision-based AD algorithms. While existing approaches
have leveraged generative models for controllable image/video generation, they
remain constrained to generating multi-view video sequences with fixed camera
viewpoints and video frequency, significantly limiting their downstream
applications. To address this, we present a generalizable camera simulation
framework DriveCamSim, whose core innovation lies in the proposed Explicit
Camera Modeling (ECM) mechanism. Instead of implicit interaction through
vanilla attention, ECM establishes explicit pixel-wise correspondences across
multi-view and multi-frame dimensions, decoupling the model from overfitting to
the specific camera configurations (intrinsic/extrinsic parameters, number of
views) and temporal sampling rates presented in the training data. For
controllable generation, we identify the issue of information loss inherent in
existing conditional encoding and injection pipelines, proposing an
information-preserving control mechanism. This control mechanism not only
improves conditional controllability, but also can be extended to be
identity-aware to enhance temporal consistency in foreground object rendering.
With above designs, our model demonstrates superior performance in both visual
quality and controllability, as well as generalization capability across
spatial-level (camera parameters variations) and temporal-level (video frame
rate variations), enabling flexible user-customizable camera simulation
tailored to diverse application scenarios. Code will be avaliable at
https://github.com/swc-17/DriveCamSim for facilitating future research.

Abstract: This position paper argues that Mean Opinion Score (MOS), while historically
foundational, is no longer sufficient as the sole supervisory signal for
multimedia quality assessment models. MOS reduces rich, context-sensitive human
judgments to a single scalar, obscuring semantic failures, user intent, and the
rationale behind quality decisions. We contend that modern quality assessment
models must integrate three interdependent capabilities: (1) context-awareness,
to adapt evaluations to task-specific goals and viewing conditions; (2)
reasoning, to produce interpretable, evidence-grounded justifications for
quality judgments; and (3) multimodality, to align perceptual and semantic cues
using vision-language models. We critique the limitations of current
MOS-centric benchmarks and propose a roadmap for reform: richer datasets with
contextual metadata and expert rationales, and new evaluation metrics that
assess semantic alignment, reasoning fidelity, and contextual sensitivity. By
reframing quality assessment as a contextual, explainable, and multimodal
modeling task, we aim to catalyze a shift toward more robust, human-aligned,
and trustworthy evaluation systems.

Abstract: Equivariant and invariant deep learning models have been developed to exploit
intrinsic symmetries in data, demonstrating significant effectiveness in
certain scenarios. However, these methods often suffer from limited
representation accuracy and rely on strict symmetry assumptions that may not
hold in practice. These limitations pose a significant drawback for image
restoration tasks, which demands high accuracy and precise symmetry
representation. To address these challenges, we propose a rotation-equivariant
regularization strategy that adaptively enforces the appropriate symmetry
constraints on the data while preserving the network's representational
accuracy. Specifically, we introduce EQ-Reg, a regularizer designed to enhance
rotation equivariance, which innovatively extends the insights of
data-augmentation-based and equivariant-based methodologies. This is achieved
through self-supervised learning and the spatial rotation and cyclic channel
shift of feature maps deduce in the equivariant framework. Our approach firstly
enables a non-strictly equivariant network suitable for image restoration,
providing a simple and adaptive mechanism for adjusting equivariance based on
task. Extensive experiments across three low-level tasks demonstrate the
superior accuracy and generalization capability of our method, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Recent studies show that simple training-free techniques can dramatically

Guidance (CFG) or FreeU. However, these training-free techniques have been
underexplored in the lens of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which is a
popular and effective technique to leverage the power of pretrained text-to-2D
diffusion models for various tasks. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the
effect such training-free techniques have on SDS, via a particular application
of text-to-3D generation via 2D lifting. We present our findings, which show
that varying the scales of CFG presents a trade-off between object size and
surface smoothness, while varying the scales of FreeU presents a trade-off
between texture details and geometric errors. Based on these findings, we
provide insights into how we can effectively harness training-free techniques
for SDS, via a strategic scaling of such techniques in a dynamic manner with
respect to the timestep or optimization iteration step. We show that using our
proposed scheme strikes a favorable balance between texture details and surface
smoothness in text-to-3D generations, while preserving the size of the output
and mitigating the occurrence of geometric defects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DIP relies on pixel-wise loss and early stopping to avoid overfitting, but lacks explicit spectral coherence. DSP aims to align with the frequency structure of images and spectral bias of CNNs.

Method: DSP matches Fourier coefficients between network output and observed measurements, acting as an implicit spectral regulariser. Theoretical analysis covers convergence dynamics, stability, and bias-variance tradeoffs.

Result: DSP outperforms classical DIP and other unsupervised baselines in denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: DSP provides a robust and interpretable framework for image reconstruction by leveraging spectral coherence.

Abstract: We introduce Deep Spectral Prior (DSP), a new formulation of Deep Image Prior
(DIP) that redefines image reconstruction as a frequency-domain alignment
problem. Unlike traditional DIP, which relies on pixel-wise loss and early
stopping to mitigate overfitting, DSP directly matches Fourier coefficients
between the network output and observed measurements. This shift introduces an
explicit inductive bias towards spectral coherence, aligning with the known
frequency structure of images and the spectral bias of convolutional neural
networks. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating that DSP
acts as an implicit spectral regulariser, suppressing high-frequency noise by
design and eliminating the need for early stopping. Our analysis spans four
core dimensions establishing smooth convergence dynamics, local stability, and
favourable bias-variance tradeoffs. We further show that DSP naturally projects
reconstructions onto a frequency-consistent manifold, enhancing
interpretability and robustness. These theoretical guarantees are supported by
empirical results across denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks,
where DSP consistently outperforms classical DIP and other unsupervised
baselines.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image-to-video (I2V) generation have shown promising
performance in conventional scenarios. However, these methods still encounter
significant challenges when dealing with complex scenes that require a deep
understanding of nuanced motion and intricate object-action relationships. To
address these challenges, we present Dynamic-I2V, an innovative framework that
integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to jointly encode visual
and textual conditions for a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture. By
leveraging the advanced multimodal understanding capabilities of MLLMs, our
model significantly improves motion controllability and temporal coherence in
synthesized videos. The inherent multimodality of Dynamic-I2V further enables
flexible support for diverse conditional inputs, extending its applicability to
various downstream generation tasks. Through systematic analysis, we identify a
critical limitation in current I2V benchmarks: a significant bias towards
favoring low-dynamic videos, stemming from an inadequate balance between motion
complexity and visual quality metrics. To resolve this evaluation gap, we
propose DIVE - a novel assessment benchmark specifically designed for
comprehensive dynamic quality measurement in I2V generation. In conclusion,
extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm that Dynamic-I2V
attains state-of-the-art performance in image-to-video generation, particularly
revealing significant improvements of 42.5%, 7.9%, and 11.8% in dynamic range,

captures motion information more accurately and mitigates background scene

Integrate-and-Fire neurons based on global motion and contextual semantic

Conclusion: PHI通过解决领域偏移问题，为长视频AQA任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate the quantitative
performance of actions in long videos. However, existing methods face
challenges due to domain shifts between the pre-trained large-scale action
recognition backbones and the specific AQA task, thereby hindering their
performance. This arises since fine-tuning resource-intensive backbones on
small AQA datasets is impractical. We address this by identifying two levels of
domain shift: task-level, regarding differences in task objectives, and
feature-level, regarding differences in important features. For feature-level
shifts, which are more detrimental, we propose Progressive Hierarchical
Instruction (PHI) with two strategies. First, Gap Minimization Flow (GMF)
leverages flow matching to progressively learn a fast flow path that reduces
the domain gap between initial and desired features across shallow to deep
layers. Additionally, a temporally-enhanced attention module captures
long-range dependencies essential for AQA. Second, List-wise Contrastive
Regularization (LCR) facilitates coarse-to-fine alignment by comprehensively
comparing batch pairs to learn fine-grained cues while mitigating domain shift.
Integrating these modules, PHI offers an effective solution. Experiments
demonstrate that PHI achieves state-of-the-art performance on three
representative long-term AQA datasets, proving its superiority in addressing
the domain shift for long-term AQA.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) inherently encode strong inductive
biases, enabling effective generalization on small-scale datasets. In this
paper, we propose integrating this inductive bias into ViTs, not through an
architectural intervention but solely through initialization. The motivation
here is to have a ViT that can enjoy strong CNN-like performance when data
assets are small, but can still scale to ViT-like performance as the data
expands. Our approach is motivated by our empirical results that random impulse
filters can achieve commensurate performance to learned filters within a CNN.
We improve upon current ViT initialization strategies, which typically rely on
empirical heuristics such as using attention weights from pretrained models or
focusing on the distribution of attention weights without enforcing structures.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
standard ViT initialization across numerous small and medium-scale benchmarks,
including Food-101, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, Flowers, and Pets, while
maintaining comparative performance on large-scale datasets such as
ImageNet-1K. Moreover, our initialization strategy can be easily integrated

Benefiting from the powerful semantic understanding capabilities of Multi-modal

which significantly reduces the unknown recognition rate of MLLMs in
multi-modal semantic generation and improves the quality of generated text.
Additionally, we propose a novel ReID framework NEXT, the Multi-grained Mixture

Specifically, we decouple the recognition problem into semantic and structural
expert branches to separately capture modality-specific appearance and
intrinsic structure. For semantic recognition, we propose the Text-Modulated
Semantic-sampling Experts (TMSE), which leverages randomly sampled high-quality
semantic texts to modulate expert-specific sampling of multi-modal features and
mining intra-modality fine-grained semantic cues. Then, to recognize
coarse-grained structure features, we propose the Context-Shared
Structure-aware Experts (CSSE) that focuses on capturing the holistic object
structure across modalities and maintains inter-modality structural consistency
through a soft routing mechanism. Finally, we propose the Multi-Modal Feature
Aggregation (MMFA), which adopts a unified feature fusion strategy to simply
and effectively integrate semantic and structural expert outputs into the final
identity representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D场景解析方法依赖大量手动标注数据，耗时且昂贵，DepthMatch旨在通过半监督学习减少标注需求。

Method: 提出补丁混合增强、轻量级空间先验注入器和深度引导边界损失，优化特征融合和边界预测。

Result: 在NYUv2和KITTI数据集上达到最先进水平，适用于室内外场景。

Conclusion: DepthMatch通过半监督学习显著减少标注需求，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: RGB-D scene parsing methods effectively capture both semantic and geometric
features of the environment, demonstrating great potential under challenging
conditions such as extreme weather and low lighting. However, existing RGB-D
scene parsing methods predominantly rely on supervised training strategies,
which require a large amount of manually annotated pixel-level labels that are
both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
DepthMatch, a semi-supervised learning framework that is specifically designed
for RGB-D scene parsing. To make full use of unlabeled data, we propose
complementary patch mix-up augmentation to explore the latent relationships
between texture and spatial features in RGB-D image pairs. We also design a
lightweight spatial prior injector to replace traditional complex fusion
modules, improving the efficiency of heterogeneous feature fusion. Furthermore,
we introduce depth-guided boundary loss to enhance the model's boundary
prediction capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DepthMatch
exhibits high applicability in both indoor and outdoor scenes, achieving
state-of-the-art results on the NYUv2 dataset and ranking first on the KITTI
Semantics benchmark.

Abstract: Videos are unique in their integration of temporal elements, including
camera, scene, action, and attribute, along with their dynamic relationships

diverse video scenarios and dynamics, assisted by interpretable and robust
evaluation criteria. We evaluate several leading models on our benchmark,

Conclusion: 注入空间上下文显著提升了VLMs在3D场景理解和生成中的能力，具有在计算机图形学、3D视觉和具身应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by
vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate
structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains
their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive
simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that
enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by
injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal
input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that
provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud
capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich
spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints.
Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware
working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities
with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on
this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which
the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline
features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment
setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene
hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and
challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior
work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs
to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path
planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in
computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

Abstract: The emergence of pathology foundation models has revolutionized computational
histopathology, enabling highly accurate, generalized whole-slide image
analysis for improved cancer diagnosis, and prognosis assessment. While these
models show remarkable potential across cancer diagnostics and prognostics,
their clinical translation faces critical challenges including variability in
optimal model across cancer types, potential data leakage in evaluation, and
lack of standardized benchmarks. Without rigorous, unbiased evaluation, even
the most advanced PFMs risk remaining confined to research settings, delaying
their life-saving applications. Existing benchmarking efforts remain limited by
narrow cancer-type focus, potential pretraining data overlaps, or incomplete
task coverage. We present PathBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
addressing these gaps through: multi-center in-hourse datasets spanning common
cancers with rigorous leakage prevention, evaluation across the full clinical
spectrum from diagnosis to prognosis, and an automated leaderboard system for
continuous model assessment. Our framework incorporates large-scale data,
enabling objective comparison of PFMs while reflecting real-world clinical
complexity. All evaluation data comes from private medical providers, with
strict exclusion of any pretraining usage to avoid data leakage risks. We have
collected 15,888 WSIs from 8,549 patients across 10 hospitals, encompassing
over 64 diagnosis and prognosis tasks. Currently, our evaluation of 19 PFMs
shows that Virchow2 and H-Optimus-1 are the most effective models overall. This
work provides researchers with a robust platform for model development and
offers clinicians actionable insights into PFM performance across diverse
clinical scenarios, ultimately accelerating the translation of these

Abstract: This paper aims to model the dynamics of 3D Gaussians from visual
observations to support temporal extrapolation. Existing dynamic 3D
reconstruction methods often struggle to effectively learn underlying dynamics
or rely heavily on manually defined physical priors, which limits their
extrapolation capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic
3D Gaussian Splatting prior-free motion extrapolation framework based on
particle dynamics systems. The core advantage of our method lies in its ability
to learn differential equations that describe the dynamics of 3D Gaussians, and
follow them during future frame extrapolation. Instead of simply fitting to the
observed visual frame sequence, we aim to more effectively model the gaussian
particle dynamics system. To this end, we introduce a dynamics latent state
vector into the standard Gaussian kernel and design a dynamics latent space
encoder to extract initial state. Subsequently, we introduce a Neural
ODEs-based dynamics module that models the temporal evolution of Gaussian in
dynamics latent space. Finally, a Gaussian kernel space decoder is used to
decode latent state at the specific time step into the deformation.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable
rendering quality with existing approaches in reconstruction tasks, and
significantly outperforms them in future frame extrapolation. Our code is

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have enabled high-fidelity

Conclusion: MotionPro实现了更精确的运动控制，并提供了新的评估基准。

Abstract: Animating images with interactive motion control has garnered popularity for
image-to-video (I2V) generation. Modern approaches typically rely on large
Gaussian kernels to extend motion trajectories as condition without explicitly
defining movement region, leading to coarse motion control and failing to
disentangle object and camera moving. To alleviate these, we present MotionPro,
a precise motion controller that novelly leverages region-wise trajectory and
motion mask to regulate fine-grained motion synthesis and identify target
motion category (i.e., object or camera moving), respectively. Technically,
MotionPro first estimates the flow maps on each training video via a tracking
model, and then samples the region-wise trajectories to simulate inference
scenario. Instead of extending flow through large Gaussian kernels, our
region-wise trajectory approach enables more precise control by directly
utilizing trajectories within local regions, thereby effectively characterizing
fine-grained movements. A motion mask is simultaneously derived from the
predicted flow maps to capture the holistic motion dynamics of the movement
regions. To pursue natural motion control, MotionPro further strengthens video
denoising by incorporating both region-wise trajectories and motion mask
through feature modulation. More remarkably, we meticulously construct a
benchmark, i.e., MC-Bench, with 1.1K user-annotated image-trajectory pairs, for
the evaluation of both fine-grained and object-level I2V motion control.
Extensive experiments conducted on WebVid-10M and MC-Bench demonstrate the
effectiveness of MotionPro. Please refer to our project page for more results:

Result: 在多个下游任务数据集上表现优异，内存效率高且支持更大批次训练。

Conclusion: PerA为遥感图像解释提供了高质量特征，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables us to pre-train foundation models
without costly labeled data. Among SSL methods, Contrastive Learning (CL)
methods are better at obtaining accurate semantic representations in noise
interference. However, due to the significant domain gap, while CL methods have
achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, they still require
specific adaptation for Remote Sensing (RS) images. To this end, we present a
novel self-supervised method called PerA, which produces all-purpose RS
features through semantically Perfectly Aligned sample pairs. Specifically,
PerA obtains features from sampled views by applying spatially disjoint masks
to augmented images rather than random cropping. With disjoint masks, we divide
patches from different views into different parts that are semantically aligned
but inconsistent in appearance. Our framework provides high-quality features by
ensuring consistency between teacher and student and predicting learnable mask
tokens. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method demonstrates
higher memory efficiency and can be trained with larger batches due to its
sparse inputs. We also collect an unlabeled pre-training dataset, which
contains about 5 million RS images. We conducted experiments on multiple
downstream task datasets and achieved performance comparable to previous
state-of-the-art methods with a limited model scale, which verified the
superiority of our method. We hope this work will contribute to practical
remote sensing interpretation works.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning models deployed on edge devices,
e.g., for quality control in Additive Manufacturing (AM), are frequently small
in size. Such models usually have to deliver highly accurate results within a
short time frame. Methods that are commonly employed in literature start out
with larger trained models and try to reduce their memory and latency footprint
by structural pruning, knowledge distillation, or quantization. It is, however,
also possible to leverage hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS), an
approach that seeks to systematically explore the architecture space to find
optimized configurations. In this study, a hardware-aware NAS workflow is
introduced that couples an edge device located in Belgium with a powerful
High-Performance Computing system in Germany, to train possible architecture
candidates as fast as possible while performing real-time latency measurements
on the target hardware. The approach is verified on a use case in the AM

inference speed while simultaneously enhancing model quality by a factor of

Abstract: Generating high-quality piano audio from video requires precise
synchronization between visual cues and musical output, ensuring accurate
semantic and temporal alignment.However, existing evaluation datasets do not
fully capture the intricate synchronization required for piano music
generation. A comprehensive benchmark is essential for two primary reasons: (1)
existing metrics fail to reflect the complexity of video-to-piano music
interactions, and (2) a dedicated benchmark dataset can provide valuable
insights to accelerate progress in high-quality piano music generation. To
address these challenges, we introduce the CoP Benchmark Dataset-a fully
open-sourced, multimodal benchmark designed specifically for video-guided piano
music generation. The proposed Chain-of-Perform (CoP) benchmark offers several
compelling features: (1) detailed multimodal annotations, enabling precise

Conclusion: DenoisingGait通过生成扩散模型和特征匹配模块，有效减少了步态识别中的噪声，提升了性能。

Abstract: To capture individual gait patterns, excluding identity-irrelevant cues in
walking videos, such as clothing texture and color, remains a persistent
challenge for vision-based gait recognition. Traditional silhouette- and
pose-based methods, though theoretically effective at removing such
distractions, often fall short of high accuracy due to their sparse and less
informative inputs. Emerging end-to-end methods address this by directly
denoising RGB videos using human priors. Building on this trend, we propose
DenoisingGait, a novel gait denoising method. Inspired by the philosophy that
"what I cannot create, I do not understand", we turn to generative diffusion
models, uncovering how they partially filter out irrelevant factors for gait
understanding. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-driven Feature Matching
module, which, combined with background removal via human silhouettes,
condenses the multi-channel diffusion features at each foreground pixel into a
two-channel direction vector. Specifically, the proposed within- and
cross-frame matching respectively capture the local vectorized structures of
gait appearance and motion, producing a novel flow-like gait representation
termed Gait Feature Field, which further reduces residual noise in diffusion
features. Experiments on the CCPG, CASIA-B*, and SUSTech1K datasets demonstrate
that DenoisingGait achieves a new SoTA performance in most cases for both
within- and cross-domain evaluations. Code is available at

Abstract: Deepfakes pose a significant threat to digital media security, with current
detection methods struggling to generalize across different manipulation
techniques and datasets. While recent approaches combine CNN-based
architectures with Vision Transformers or leverage multi-modal learning, they
remain limited by the inherent constraints of RGB data. We introduce HyperFake,
a novel deepfake detection pipeline that reconstructs 31-channel hyperspectral
data from standard RGB videos, revealing hidden manipulation traces invisible
to conventional methods. Using an improved MST++ architecture, HyperFake
enhances hyperspectral reconstruction, while a spectral attention mechanism
selects the most critical spectral features for deepfake detection. The refined
spectral data is then processed by an EfficientNet-based classifier optimized
for spectral analysis, enabling more accurate and generalizable detection
across different deepfake styles and datasets, all without the need for
expensive hyperspectral cameras. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first approach to leverage hyperspectral imaging reconstruction for deepfake
detection, opening new possibilities for detecting increasingly sophisticated

TL;DR: CoZ是一个模型无关的框架，通过分解超分辨率任务为多步缩放链，利用多尺度感知提示和预训练模型，实现极端放大效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单图像超分辨率（SISR）模型在超出训练范围时性能崩溃的问题。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Zoom（CoZ）框架，将SISR分解为多步缩放链，结合多尺度感知提示和视觉语言模型（VLM）生成文本指导。

Result: 标准4x扩散SR模型在CoZ框架下实现256x放大，保持高质量和保真度。

Conclusion: CoZ通过分解任务和利用多模态提示，显著提升了SISR的可扩展性。

Abstract: Modern single-image super-resolution (SISR) models deliver photo-realistic
results at the scale factors on which they are trained, but collapse when asked
to magnify far beyond that regime. We address this scalability bottleneck with
Chain-of-Zoom (CoZ), a model-agnostic framework that factorizes SISR into an
autoregressive chain of intermediate scale-states with multi-scale-aware
prompts. CoZ repeatedly re-uses a backbone SR model, decomposing the
conditional probability into tractable sub-problems to achieve extreme
resolutions without additional training. Because visual cues diminish at high
magnifications, we augment each zoom step with multi-scale-aware text prompts
generated by a vision-language model (VLM). The prompt extractor itself is
fine-tuned using Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a critic
VLM, aligning text guidance towards human preference. Experiments show that a
standard 4x diffusion SR model wrapped in CoZ attains beyond 256x enlargement
with high perceptual quality and fidelity.

Conclusion: 该方法在修复退化图像时表现出色，同时提供了灵活的控制能力。

Abstract: Restoring real-world degraded images, such as old photographs or
low-resolution images, presents a significant challenge due to the complex,
mixed degradations they exhibit, such as scratches, color fading, and noise.
Recent data-driven approaches have struggled with two main challenges:
achieving high-fidelity restoration and providing object-level control over
colorization. While diffusion models have shown promise in generating
high-quality images with specific controls, they often fail to fully preserve
image details during restoration. In this work, we propose an internal
detail-preserving diffusion model for high-fidelity restoration of real-world
degraded images. Our method utilizes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model as a
generative prior, eliminating the need to train a model from scratch. Central
to our approach is the Internal Image Detail Enhancement (IIDE) technique,
which directs the diffusion model to preserve essential structural and textural
information while mitigating degradation effects. The process starts by mapping
the input image into a latent space, where we inject the diffusion denoising
process with degradation operations that simulate the effects of various
degradation factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both qualitative
assessments and perceptual quantitative evaluations. Additionally, our approach
supports text-guided restoration, enabling object-level colorization control
that mimics the expertise of professional photo editing.

Abstract: Early identification of weeds is essential for effective management and
control, and there is growing interest in automating the process using computer
vision techniques coupled with AI methods. However, challenges associated with
training AI-based weed identification models, such as limited expert-verified
data and complexity and variability in morphological features, have hindered
progress. To address these issues, we present WeedNet, the first global-scale
weed identification model capable of recognizing an extensive set of weed
species, including noxious and invasive plant species. WeedNet is an end-to-end
real-time weed identification pipeline and uses self-supervised learning,
fine-tuning, and enhanced trustworthiness strategies. WeedNet achieved 91.02%
accuracy across 1,593 weed species, with 41% species achieving 100% accuracy.
Using a fine-tuning strategy and a Global-to-Local approach, the local Iowa
WeedNet model achieved an overall accuracy of 97.38% for 85 Iowa weeds, most
classes exceeded a 90% mean accuracy per class. Testing across intra-species
dissimilarity (developmental stages) and inter-species similarity (look-alike
species) suggests that diversity in the images collected, spanning all the
growth stages and distinguishable plant characteristics, is crucial in driving
model performance. The generalizability and adaptability of the Global WeedNet
model enable it to function as a foundational model, with the Global-to-Local
strategy allowing fine-tuning for region-specific weed communities. Additional
validation of drone- and ground-rover-based images highlights the potential of
WeedNet for integration into robotic platforms. Furthermore, integration with
AI for conversational use provides intelligent agricultural and ecological
conservation consulting tools for farmers, agronomists, researchers, land
managers, and government agencies across diverse landscapes.

Conclusion: IAL框架有效解决了多模态3D全景分割中的关键挑战。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D panoptic segmentation often struggles with the inherent
sparsity of data from LiDAR sensors, which makes it challenging to accurately
recognize distant or small objects. Recently, a few studies have sought to
overcome this challenge by integrating LiDAR inputs with camera images,
leveraging the rich and dense texture information provided by the latter. While
these approaches have shown promising results, they still face challenges, such
as misalignment during data augmentation and the reliance on post-processing
steps. To address these issues, we propose Image-Assists-LiDAR (IAL), a novel
multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation framework. In IAL, we first introduce a
modality-synchronized data augmentation strategy, PieAug, to ensure alignment
between LiDAR and image inputs from the start. Next, we adopt a transformer
decoder to directly predict panoptic segmentation results. To effectively fuse
LiDAR and image features into tokens for the decoder, we design a
Geometric-guided Token Fusion (GTF) module. Additionally, we leverage the
complementary strengths of each modality as priors for query initialization
through a Prior-based Query Generation (PQG) module, enhancing the decoder's
ability to generate accurate instance masks. Our IAL framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to previous multi-modal 3D panoptic
segmentation methods on two widely used benchmarks. Code and models are

Conclusion: 论文通过改进评估协议，解决了VAD领域的评估局限性，为模型开发提供了更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate
from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing
advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training
strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and
benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through
comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in
current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single
annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of
anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene
overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation
methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round
annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a
Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate
anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks
(UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene
overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD
approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives
for future VAD model development.

Conclusion: 基于显著性的方法为情感建模提供了高效且可解释的替代方案，适用于内容创作和个性化媒体体验。

Abstract: Understanding the emotional impact of videos is crucial for applications in
content creation, advertising, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
Traditional affective computing methods rely on self-reported emotions, facial
expression analysis, and biosensing data, yet they often overlook the role of
visual saliency -- the naturally attention-grabbing regions within a video. In
this study, we utilize deep learning to introduce a novel saliency-based
approach to emotion prediction by extracting two key features: saliency area
and number of salient regions. Using the HD2S saliency model and OpenFace
facial action unit analysis, we examine the relationship between video saliency
and viewer emotions. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) Videos with
multiple salient regions tend to elicit high-valence, low-arousal emotions, (2)
Videos with a single dominant salient region are more likely to induce
low-valence, high-arousal responses, and (3) Self-reported emotions often
misalign with facial expression-based emotion detection, suggesting limitations
in subjective reporting. By leveraging saliency-driven insights, this work
provides a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative for emotion
modeling, with implications for content creation, personalized media
experiences, and affective computing research.

PosePilot can be extended to various at-home and outdoor exercises. We employ a
Vanilla LSTM, allowing the system to capture temporal dependencies for pose
recognition. Additionally, a BiLSTM with multi-head Attention enhances the
model's ability to process motion contexts, selectively focusing on key limb
angles for accurate error detection while maintaining computational efficiency.
As part of this work, we introduce a high-quality video dataset used for

Abstract: Limited Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) often faces significant challenges
due to missing angular information. Unlike previous methods that operate in the
image domain, we propose a new method that focuses on sinogram inpainting. We
leverage MR-SDEs, a variant of diffusion models that characterize the diffusion
process with mean-reverting stochastic differential equations, to fill in
missing angular data at the projection level. Furthermore, by combining
distillation with constraining the output of the model using the pseudo-inverse
of the inpainting matrix, the diffusion process is accelerated and done in a
step, enabling efficient and accurate sinogram completion. A subsequent
post-processing module back-projects the inpainted sinogram into the image
domain and further refines the reconstruction, effectively suppressing
artifacts while preserving critical structural details. Quantitative
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual and fidelity quality, offering
a promising solution for LACT reconstruction in scientific and clinical
applications.

Abstract: We present a memory-efficient algorithm for significantly enhancing the
quality of segmented 3D micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) images of rocks
using a generative model. The proposed model achieves a 16x increase in
resolution and corrects inaccuracies in segmentation caused by the overlapping
X-ray attenuation in micro-CT measurements across different minerals. The
generative model employed is a 3D Octree-based convolutional Wasserstein
generative adversarial network with gradient penalty. To address the challenge
of high memory consumption inherent in standard 3D convolutional layers, we
implemented an Octree structure within the 3D progressive growing generator
model. This enabled the use of memory-efficient 3D Octree-based convolutional
layers. The approach is pivotal in overcoming the long-standing memory
bottleneck in volumetric deep learning, making it possible to reach 16x
super-resolution in 3D, a scale that is challenging to attain due to cubic
memory scaling. For training, we utilized segmented 3D low-resolution micro-CT
images along with unpaired segmented complementary 2D high-resolution laser
scanning microscope images. Post-training, resolution improved from 7 to 0.44
micro-m/voxel with accurate segmentation of constituent minerals. Validated on
Berea sandstone, this framework demonstrates substantial improvements in pore
characterization and mineral differentiation, offering a robust solution to one
of the primary computational limitations in modern geoscientific imaging.

Abstract: Learning on triangle meshes has recently proven to be instrumental to a
myriad of tasks, from shape classification, to segmentation, to deformation and
animation, to mention just a few. While some of these applications are tackled
through neural network architectures which are tailored to the application at
hand, many others use generic frameworks for triangle meshes where the only
customization required is the modification of the input features and the loss
function. Our goal in this paper is to broaden the applicability of these
generic frameworks to "wild", i.e. meshes in-the-wild which often have multiple
components, non-manifold elements, disrupted connectivity, or a combination of
these. We propose a configurable meta-framework based on the concept of caged
geometry: Given a mesh, a cage is a single component manifold triangle mesh
that envelopes it closely. Generalized barycentric coordinates map between
functions on the cage, and functions on the mesh, allowing us to learn and test
on a variety of data, in different applications. We demonstrate this concept by
learning segmentation and skinning weights on difficult data, achieving better
performance to state of the art techniques on wild meshes.

Abstract: Autonomous robots typically need to construct representations of their
surroundings and adapt their motions to the geometry of their environment.
Here, we tackle the problem of constructing a policy model for collision-free
motion generation, consistent with the environment, from a single input RGB
image. Extracting 3D structures from a single image often involves monocular
depth estimation. Developments in depth estimation have given rise to large
pre-trained models such as DepthAnything. However, using outputs of these
models for downstream motion generation is challenging due to frustum-shaped
errors that arise. Instead, we propose a framework known as Video-Generation
Environment Representation (VGER), which leverages the advances of large-scale
video generation models to generate a moving camera video conditioned on the
input image. Frames of this video, which form a multiview dataset, are then
input into a pre-trained 3D foundation model to produce a dense point cloud. We
then introduce a multi-scale noise approach to train an implicit representation
of the environment structure and build a motion generation model that complies
with the geometry of the representation. We extensively evaluate VGER over a
diverse set of indoor and outdoor environments. We demonstrate its ability to
produce smooth motions that account for the captured geometry of a scene, all
from a single RGB input image.

Abstract: Recognizing complex emotions linked to ambivalence and hesitancy (A/H) can
play a critical role in the personalization and effectiveness of digital
behaviour change interventions. These subtle and conflicting emotions are
manifested by a discord between multiple modalities, such as facial and vocal
expressions, and body language. Although experts can be trained to identify
A/H, integrating them into digital interventions is costly and less effective.
Automatic learning systems provide a cost-effective alternative that can adapt
to individual users, and operate seamlessly within real-time, and
resource-limited environments. However, there are currently no datasets
available for the design of ML models to recognize A/H. This paper introduces a
first Behavioural Ambivalence/Hesitancy (BAH) dataset collected for
subject-based multimodal recognition of A/H in videos. It contains videos from
224 participants captured across 9 provinces in Canada, with different age, and
ethnicity. Through our web platform, we recruited participants to answer 7
questions, some of which were designed to elicit A/H while recording themselves
via webcam with microphone. BAH amounts to 1,118 videos for a total duration of
8.26 hours with 1.5 hours of A/H. Our behavioural team annotated timestamp
segments to indicate where A/H occurs, and provide frame- and video-level
annotations with the A/H cues. Video transcripts and their timestamps are also
included, along with cropped and aligned faces in each frame, and a variety of
participants meta-data. We include results baselines for BAH at frame- and
video-level recognition in multi-modal setups, in addition to zero-shot
prediction, and for personalization using unsupervised domain adaptation. The
limited performance of baseline models highlights the challenges of recognizing
A/H in real-world videos. The data, code, and pretrained weights are available.

flow. Then, instead of directly predicting the time-dependent signals, we model
the signal as the sum of video-constant values, segment-constant values, and
frame-specific residuals, as inspired by the success of residual learning. This
approach allows more flexible models that adapt to highly variable scenes. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several
established datasets, with the greatest improvements on complex scenes with
large movements, occlusions, and fine details, where current methods degrade
most.

TL;DR: DART$^3$ is a test-time adaptation framework designed to mitigate camera-induced domain shifts in person re-identification (ReID), outperforming existing methods without requiring source data or retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Person ReID models suffer from camera bias, clustering representations by viewpoints rather than identity, degrading performance under domain shifts. Existing TTA methods, designed for classification, fail to generalize to ReID.

Method: DART$^3$ uses a distance-based objective to align with retrieval tasks, exploiting nearest-neighbor distance and prediction error correlation. It requires no source data, architectural changes, or retraining.

Result: DART$^3$ and its lightweight variant outperform state-of-the-art TTA baselines on multiple ReID benchmarks.

Conclusion: DART$^3$ is a viable solution for online learning to mitigate camera bias in ReID.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) models are known to suffer from camera bias,
where learned representations cluster according to camera viewpoints rather
than identity, leading to significant performance degradation under
(inter-camera) domain shifts in real-world surveillance systems when new
cameras are added to camera networks. State-of-the-art test-time adaptation
(TTA) methods, largely designed for classification tasks, rely on
classification entropy-based objectives that fail to generalize well to ReID,
thus making them unsuitable for tackling camera bias. In this paper, we
introduce DART$^3$, a TTA framework specifically designed to mitigate
camera-induced domain shifts in person ReID. DART$^3$ (Distance-Aware Retrieval
Tuning at Test Time) leverages a distance-based objective that aligns better
with image retrieval tasks like ReID by exploiting the correlation between
nearest-neighbor distance and prediction error. Unlike prior ReID-specific
domain adaptation methods, DART$^3$ requires no source data, architectural
modifications, or retraining, and can be deployed in both fully black-box and
hybrid settings. Empirical evaluations on multiple ReID benchmarks indicate
that DART$^3$ and DART$^3$ LITE, a lightweight alternative to the approach,
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TTA baselines, making for a viable
option to online learning to mitigate the adverse effects of camera bias.

Conclusion: 弱监督学习框架结合3D T分布损失函数显著提升了预测的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Cochlear implant surgery is a treatment for individuals with severe hearing
loss. It involves inserting an array of electrodes inside the cochlea to
electrically stimulate the auditory nerve and restore hearing sensation. A
crucial step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, a surgical intervention that
removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone, providing a critical
pathway to the cochlea for electrode placement. Accurate prediction of the
mastoidectomy region from preoperative imaging assists presurgical planning,
reduces surgical risks, and improves surgical outcomes. In previous work, a
self-supervised network was introduced to predict the mastoidectomy region
using only preoperative CT scans. While promising, the method suffered from
suboptimal robustness, limiting its practical application. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel weakly-supervised Mamba-based framework to
predict accurate mastoidectomy regions directly from preoperative CT scans. Our
approach utilizes a 3D T-Distribution loss function inspired by the Student-t
distribution, which effectively handles the complex geometric variability
inherent in mastoidectomy shapes. Weak supervision is achieved using the
segmentation results from the prior self-supervised network to eliminate the
need for manual data cleaning or labeling throughout the training process. The
proposed method is extensively evaluated against state-of-the-art approaches,
demonstrating superior performance in predicting accurate and clinically
relevant mastoidectomy regions. Our findings highlight the robustness and
efficiency of the weakly-supervised learning framework with the proposed novel
3D T-Distribution loss.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆对老年人独立生活至关重要，但认知障碍可能影响其接管能力，情感反应分析有助于改进系统设计。

Method: 通过面部表情分析测量效价和唤醒度，比较不同道路几何和速度下的情感状态，使用Wilcoxon和Mann-Whitney U检验分析数据。

Conclusion: 认知障碍者情感反应不足，需开发能检测情感状态并支持安全接管的车辆系统。

Abstract: Driving is a key component of independence and quality of life for older
adults. However, cognitive decline associated with conditions such as mild
cognitive impairment and dementia can compromise driving safety and often lead
to premature driving cessation. Conditionally automated vehicles, which require
drivers to take over control when automation reaches its operational limits,
offer a potential assistive solution. However, their effectiveness depends on
the driver's ability to respond to takeover requests (TORs) in a timely and
appropriate manner. Understanding emotional responses during TORs can provide
insight into drivers' engagement, stress levels, and readiness to resume
control, particularly in cognitively vulnerable populations. This study
investigated affective responses, measured via facial expression analysis of
valence and arousal, during TORs among cognitively healthy older adults and
those with cognitive impairment. Facial affect data were analyzed across
different road geometries and speeds to evaluate within- and between-group
differences in affective states. Within-group comparisons using the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test revealed significant changes in valence and arousal during
TORs for both groups. Cognitively healthy individuals showed adaptive increases
in arousal under higher-demand conditions, while those with cognitive
impairment exhibited reduced arousal and more positive valence in several
scenarios. Between-group comparisons using the Mann-Whitney U test indicated
that cognitively impaired individuals displayed lower arousal and higher
valence than controls across different TOR conditions. These findings suggest
reduced emotional response and awareness in cognitively impaired drivers,
highlighting the need for adaptive vehicle systems that detect affective states
and support safe handovers for vulnerable users.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation, particularly in multi-domain scenarios, requires
precise preservation of anatomical structures across diverse representations.
While deep learning has advanced this field, existing models often struggle
with accurate boundary representation, variability in organ morphology, and
information loss during downsampling, limiting their accuracy and robustness.
To address these challenges, we propose the Context Enhancement Network
(CENet), a novel segmentation framework featuring two key innovations. First,
the Dual Selective Enhancement Block (DSEB) integrated into skip connections
enhances boundary details and improves the detection of smaller organs in a
context-aware manner. Second, the Context Feature Attention Module (CFAM) in
the decoder employs a multi-scale design to maintain spatial integrity, reduce
feature redundancy, and mitigate overly enhanced representations. Extensive
evaluations on both radiology and dermoscopic datasets demonstrate that CENet
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in multi-organ segmentation and
boundary detail preservation, offering a robust and accurate solution for
complex medical image analysis tasks. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Advances in markerless motion capture are expanding access to biomechanical
movement analysis, making it feasible to obtain high-quality movement data from
outpatient clinics, inpatient hospitals, therapy, and even home. Expanding
access to movement data in these diverse contexts makes the challenge of
performing downstream analytics all the more acute. Creating separate bespoke
analysis code for all the tasks end users might want is both intractable and
does not take advantage of the common features of human movement underlying
them all. Recent studies have shown that fine-tuning language models to accept
tokenized movement as an additional modality enables successful descriptive
captioning of movement. Here, we explore whether such a multimodal
motion-language model can answer detailed, clinically meaningful questions
about movement. We collected over 30 hours of biomechanics from nearly 500
participants, many with movement impairments from a variety of etiologies,
performing a range of movements used in clinical outcomes assessments. After
tokenizing these movement trajectories, we created a multimodal dataset of
motion-related questions and answers spanning a range of tasks. We developed
BiomechGPT, a multimodal biomechanics-language model, on this dataset. Our
results show that BiomechGPT demonstrates high performance across a range of
tasks such as activity recognition, identifying movement impairments,
diagnosis, scoring clinical outcomes, and measuring walking. BiomechGPT
provides an important step towards a foundation model for rehabilitation
movement data.

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the challenge of insufficient
three-dimensional context in synthetic datasets for scene text rendering.
Although recent advances in diffusion models and related techniques have
improved certain aspects of scene text generation, most existing approaches
continue to rely on 2D data, sourcing authentic training examples from movie
posters and book covers, which limits their ability to capture the complex
interactions among spatial layout and visual effects in real-world scenes. In
particular, traditional 2D datasets do not provide the necessary geometric cues
for accurately embedding text into diverse backgrounds. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel standard for constructing synthetic datasets
that incorporates surface normals to enrich three-dimensional scene
characteristic. By adding surface normals to conventional 2D data, our approach
aims to enhance the representation of spatial relationships and provide a more
robust foundation for future scene text rendering methods. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that datasets built under this new standard offer
improved geometric context, facilitating further advancements in text rendering
under complex 3D-spatial conditions.

Abstract: Robust long-term visual localization in complex industrial environments is
critical for mobile robotic systems. Existing approaches face limitations:
handcrafted features are illumination-sensitive, learned features are
computationally intensive, and semantic- or marker-based methods are
environmentally constrained. Handcrafted and learned features share similar
representations but differ functionally. Handcrafted features are optimized for
continuous tracking, while learned features excel in wide-baseline matching.
Their complementarity calls for integration rather than replacement. Building
on this, we propose a hierarchical localization framework. It leverages
real-time handcrafted feature extraction for relative pose estimation. In
parallel, it employs selective learned keypoint detection on optimized
keyframes for absolute positioning. This design enables CPU-efficient,
long-term visual localization. Experiments systematically progress through
three validation phases: Initially establishing feature complementarity through
comparative analysis, followed by computational latency profiling across
algorithm stages on CPU platforms. Final evaluation under photometric
variations (including seasonal transitions and diurnal cycles) demonstrates 47%
average error reduction with significantly improved localization consistency.

Conclusion: WeakMCN通过多任务协作和动态特征增强，显著提升了弱监督指代表达任务的性能。

Abstract: Weakly supervised referring expression comprehension(WREC) and
segmentation(WRES) aim to learn object grounding based on a given expression
using weak supervision signals like image-text pairs. While these tasks have
traditionally been modeled separately, we argue that they can benefit from
joint learning in a multi-task framework. To this end, we propose WeakMCN, a
novel multi-task collaborative network that effectively combines WREC and WRES
with a dual-branch architecture. Specifically, the WREC branch is formulated as
anchor-based contrastive learning, which also acts as a teacher to supervise
the WRES branch. In WeakMCN, we propose two innovative designs to facilitate
multi-task collaboration, namely Dynamic Visual Feature Enhancement(DVFE) and
Collaborative Consistency Module(CCM). DVFE dynamically combines various
pre-trained visual knowledge to meet different task requirements, while CCM
promotes cross-task consistency from the perspective of optimization. Extensive
experimental results on three popular REC and RES benchmarks, i.e., RefCOCO,
RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, consistently demonstrate performance gains of WeakMCN
over state-of-the-art single-task alternatives, e.g., up to 3.91% and 13.11% on
RefCOCO for WREC and WRES tasks, respectively. Furthermore, experiments also
validate the strong generalization ability of WeakMCN in both semi-supervised
REC and RES settings against existing methods, e.g., +8.94% for semi-REC and
+7.71% for semi-RES on 1% RefCOCO. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Document alignment and registration play a crucial role in numerous
real-world applications, such as automated form processing, anomaly detection,
and workflow automation. Traditional methods for document alignment rely on
image-based features like keypoints, edges, and textures to estimate geometric
transformations, such as homographies. However, these approaches often require
access to the original document images, which may not always be available due
to privacy, storage, or transmission constraints. This paper introduces a novel
approach that leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) outputs as features
for homography estimation. By utilizing the spatial positions and textual
content of OCR-detected words, our method enables document alignment without
relying on pixel-level image data. This technique is particularly valuable in
scenarios where only OCR outputs are accessible. Furthermore, the method is
robust to OCR noise, incorporating RANSAC to handle outliers and inaccuracies
in the OCR data. On a set of test documents, we demonstrate that our OCR-based
approach even performs more accurately than traditional image-based methods,
offering a more efficient and scalable solution for document registration
tasks. The proposed method facilitates applications in document processing, all
while reducing reliance on high-dimensional image data.

Abstract: Most publicly available medical segmentation datasets are only partially
labeled, with annotations provided for a subset of anatomical structures. When
multiple datasets are combined for training, this incomplete annotation poses
challenges, as it limits the model's ability to learn shared anatomical
representations among datasets. Furthermore, vision-only frameworks often fail
to capture complex anatomical relationships and task-specific distinctions,
leading to reduced segmentation accuracy and poor generalizability to unseen
datasets. In this study, we proposed a novel CLIP-DINO Prompt-Driven
Segmentation Network (CDPDNet), which combined a self-supervised vision
transformer with CLIP-based text embedding and introduced task-specific text
prompts to tackle these challenges. Specifically, the framework was constructed
upon a convolutional neural network (CNN) and incorporated DINOv2 to extract
both fine-grained and global visual features, which were then fused using a
multi-head cross-attention module to overcome the limited long-range modeling
capability of CNNs. In addition, CLIP-derived text embeddings were projected
into the visual space to help model complex relationships among organs and
tumors. To further address the partial label challenge and enhance inter-task
discriminative capability, a Text-based Task Prompt Generation (TTPG) module
that generated task-specific prompts was designed to guide the segmentation.
Extensive experiments on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrated that
CDPDNet consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art segmentation
methods. Code and pretrained model are available at:

Abstract: Accurate tumour segmentation is vital for various targeted diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures for cancer, e.g., planning biopsies or tumour ablations.
Manual delineation is extremely labour-intensive, requiring substantial expert
time. Fully-supervised machine learning models aim to automate such
localisation tasks, but require a large number of costly and often subjective
3D voxel-level labels for training. The high-variance and subjectivity in such
labels impacts model generalisability, even when large datasets are available.
Histopathology labels may offer more objective labels but the infeasibility of
acquiring pixel-level annotations to develop tumour localisation methods based
on histology remains challenging in-vivo. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised semantic segmentation framework called SPARS (Self-Play
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Segmentation), which utilises an object
presence classifier, trained on a small number of image-level binary cancer
presence labels, to localise cancerous regions on CT scans. Such binary labels
of patient-level cancer presence can be sourced more feasibly from biopsies and
histopathology reports, enabling a more objective cancer localisation on
medical images. Evaluating with real patient data, we observed that SPARS
yielded a mean dice score of $77.3 \pm 9.4$, which outperformed other
weakly-supervised methods by large margins. This performance was comparable
with recent fully-supervised methods that require voxel-level annotations. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using SPARS to reduce the need for
extensive human-annotated labels to detect cancer in real-world healthcare
settings.

improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In addition, we propose a 2D-3D

Abstract: In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the learning of 3D

design a whole-aware skeleton-grouped disentangle strategy to learn a
correspondence between geometric semantical measurement of body and latent
codes, which facilitates the control of shape and posture of human body by
modifying latent coding paramerers. With the help of skeleton-grouped
whole-aware encoder and unsupervised disentanglement losses, our representation
model is learned by an unsupervised manner. Besides, a based-template residual
learning scheme is injected into the encoder to ease of learning human body
latent parameter in complicated body shape and pose spaces. Because of the
geometrically meaningful latent codes, it can be used in a wide range of
applications, from human body pose transfer to bilinear latent code
interpolation. Further more, a part-aware decoder is utlized to promote the
learning of controllable fine-grained semantics. The experimental results on
public 3D human datasets show that the method has the ability of precise
reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宏观摄影图像质量评估（MPIQA）在科学研究和医疗等领域具有重要意义，但缺乏相关数据限制了MPIQA指标的发展。

Method: 通过从公开网站收集15,700张MP图像，筛选出2,000张，并通过实验室研究获取每张图像的17个质量评分和详细质量报告，构建了MMP-2k数据库。

Result: 实验表明，现有的通用IQA指标在MP图像上表现不佳。

Conclusion: MMP-2k数据库为MPIQA研究提供了重要资源，并揭示了现有指标的局限性。

Abstract: Macro photography (MP) is a specialized field of photography that captures
objects at an extremely close range, revealing tiny details. Although an
accurate macro photography image quality assessment (MPIQA) metric can benefit
macro photograph capturing, which is vital in some domains such as scientific
research and medical applications, the lack of MPIQA data limits the
development of MPIQA metrics. To address this limitation, we conducted a
large-scale MPIQA study. Specifically, to ensure diversity both in content and
quality, we sampled 2,000 MP images from 15,700 MP images, collected from three
public image websites. For each MP image, 17 (out of 21 after outlier removal)
quality ratings and a detailed quality report of distortion magnitudes, types,
and positions are gathered by a lab study. The images, quality ratings, and
quality reports form our novel multi-labeled MPIQA database, MMP-2k.
Experimental results showed that the state-of-the-art generic IQA metrics
underperform on MP images. The database and supplementary materials are

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by the large number of parameters in existing
remote sensing image classification models, which hinder deployment on
resource-constrained devices, this paper proposes a lightweight classification
method based on knowledge distillation. Specifically, G-GhostNet is adopted as
the backbone network, leveraging feature reuse to reduce redundant parameters
and significantly improve inference efficiency. In addition, a decoupled
knowledge distillation strategy is employed, which separates target and
non-target classes to effectively enhance classification accuracy. Experimental
results on the RSOD and AID datasets demonstrate that, compared with the
high-parameter VGG-16 model, the proposed method achieves nearly equivalent
Top-1 accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by 6.24 times. This
approach strikes an excellent balance between model size and classification

Abstract: Graphic design plays a vital role in visual communication across advertising,
marketing, and multimedia entertainment. Prior work has explored automated
graphic design generation using diffusion models, aiming to streamline creative
workflows and democratize design capabilities. However, complex graphic design
scenarios require accurately adhering to design intent specified by multiple
heterogeneous user-provided elements (\eg images, layouts, and texts), which
pose multi-condition control challenges for existing methods. Specifically,
previous single-condition control models demonstrate effectiveness only within
their specialized domains but fail to generalize to other conditions, while
existing multi-condition methods often lack fine-grained control over each
sub-condition and compromise overall compositional harmony. To address these
limitations, we introduce CreatiDesign, a systematic solution for automated
graphic design covering both model architecture and dataset construction.
First, we design a unified multi-condition driven architecture that enables
flexible and precise integration of heterogeneous design elements with minimal
architectural modifications to the base diffusion model. Furthermore, to ensure
that each condition precisely controls its designated image region and to avoid
interference between conditions, we propose a multimodal attention mask
mechanism. Additionally, we develop a fully automated pipeline for constructing
graphic design datasets, and introduce a new dataset with 400K samples
featuring multi-condition annotations, along with a comprehensive benchmark.
Experimental results show that CreatiDesign outperforms existing models by a
clear margin in faithfully adhering to user intent.

Abstract: Image demoir\'eing remains a challenging task due to the complex interplay
between texture corruption and color distortions caused by moir\'e patterns.
Existing methods, especially those relying on direct image-to-image
restoration, often fail to disentangle these intertwined artifacts effectively.
While wavelet-based frequency-aware approaches offer a promising direction,
their potential remains underexplored. In this paper, we present Freqformer, a
Transformer-based framework specifically designed for image demoir\'eing
through targeted frequency separation. Our method performs an effective
frequency decomposition that explicitly splits moir\'e patterns into
high-frequency spatially-localized textures and low-frequency scale-robust
color distortions, which are then handled by a dual-branch architecture
tailored to their distinct characteristics. We further propose a learnable
Frequency Composition Transform (FCT) module to adaptively fuse the
frequency-specific outputs, enabling consistent and high-fidelity
reconstruction. To better aggregate the spatial dependencies and the
inter-channel complementary information, we introduce a Spatial-Aware Channel
Attention (SA-CA) module that refines moir\'e-sensitive regions without
incurring high computational cost. Extensive experiments on various
demoir\'eing benchmarks demonstrate that Freqformer achieves state-of-the-art
performance with a compact model size. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based on Thermal Infrared (TIR)
imaging has gained attention in novel-view synthesis, showing real-time

from transmission effects, emissivity, and low resolution, leading to floaters
and blur effects in rendered images. To address these problems, we introduce
Veta-GS, which leverages a view-dependent deformation field and a Thermal
Feature Extractor (TFE) to precisely capture subtle thermal variations and
maintain robustness. Specifically, we design view-dependent deformation field
that leverages camera position and viewing direction, which capture thermal
variations. Furthermore, we introduce the Thermal Feature Extractor (TFE) and
MonoSSIM loss, which consider appearance, edge, and frequency to maintain
robustness. Extensive experiments on the TI-NSD benchmark show that our method
achieves better performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Resolving closely-spaced small targets in dense clusters presents a
significant challenge in infrared imaging, as the overlapping signals hinder
precise determination of their quantity, sub-pixel positions, and radiation
intensities. While deep learning has advanced the field of infrared small
target detection, its application to closely-spaced infrared small targets has
not yet been explored. This gap exists primarily due to the complexity of
separating superimposed characteristics and the lack of an open-source
infrastructure. In this work, we propose the Dynamic Iterative Shrinkage
Thresholding Network (DISTA-Net), which reconceptualizes traditional sparse
reconstruction within a dynamic framework. DISTA-Net adaptively generates
convolution weights and thresholding parameters to tailor the reconstruction
process in real time. To the best of our knowledge, DISTA-Net is the first deep
learning model designed specifically for the unmixing of closely-spaced
infrared small targets, achieving superior sub-pixel detection accuracy.
Moreover, we have established the first open-source ecosystem to foster further
research in this field. This ecosystem comprises three key components: (1)
CSIST-100K, a publicly available benchmark dataset; (2) CSO-mAP, a custom
evaluation metric for sub-pixel detection; and (3) GrokCSO, an open-source
toolkit featuring DISTA-Net and other models. Our code and dataset are

Abstract: The field of computer graphics was revolutionized by models such as Neural
Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, displacing triangles as the dominant
representation for photogrammetry. In this paper, we argue for a triangle
comeback. We develop a differentiable renderer that directly optimizes
triangles via end-to-end gradients. We achieve this by rendering each triangle
as differentiable splats, combining the efficiency of triangles with the
adaptive density of representations based on independent primitives. Compared
to popular 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, our approach achieves higher
visual fidelity, faster convergence, and increased rendering throughput. On the
Mip-NeRF360 dataset, our method outperforms concurrent non-volumetric
primitives in visual fidelity and achieves higher perceptual quality than the
state-of-the-art Zip-NeRF on indoor scenes. Triangles are simple, compatible
with standard graphics stacks and GPU hardware, and highly efficient: for the
\textit{Garden} scene, we achieve over 2,400 FPS at 1280x720 resolution using
an off-the-shelf mesh renderer. These results highlight the efficiency and
effectiveness of triangle-based representations for high-quality novel view
synthesis. Triangles bring us closer to mesh-based optimization by combining
classical computer graphics with modern differentiable rendering frameworks.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis in 360$^\circ$ scenes from extremely sparse input views
is essential for applications like virtual reality and augmented reality. This
paper presents a novel framework for novel view synthesis in extremely
sparse-view cases. As typical structure-from-motion methods are unable to
estimate camera poses in extremely sparse-view cases, we apply DUSt3R to
estimate camera poses and generate a dense point cloud. Using the poses of
estimated cameras, we densely sample additional views from the upper hemisphere
space of the scenes, from which we render synthetic images together with the
point cloud. Training 3D Gaussian Splatting model on a combination of reference
images from sparse views and densely sampled synthetic images allows a larger
scene coverage in 3D space, addressing the overfitting challenge due to the
limited input in sparse-view cases. Retraining a diffusion-based image
enhancement model on our created dataset, we further improve the quality of the
point-cloud-rendered images by removing artifacts. We compare our framework
with benchmark methods in cases of only four input views, demonstrating
significant improvement in novel view synthesis under extremely sparse-view
conditions for 360$^\circ$ scenes.

Conclusion: 结合置信样本和不确定样本的协作策略能显著提升领域自适应效果。

Abstract: Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) adapts models to target domains by selectively
labeling a few target samples. Existing ADA methods prioritize uncertain
samples but overlook confident ones, which often match ground-truth. We find
that incorporating confident predictions into the labeled set before active
sampling reduces the search space and improves adaptation. To address this, we
propose a collaborative framework that labels uncertain samples while treating
highly confident predictions as ground truth. Our method combines Gaussian
Process-based Active Sampling (GPAS) for identifying uncertain samples and
Pseudo-Label-based Certain Sampling (PLCS) for confident ones, progressively
enhancing adaptation. PLCS refines the search space, and GPAS reduces the
domain gap, boosting the proportion of confident samples. Extensive experiments
on Office-Home and DomainNet show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art ADA methods.

Abstract: Conventional frame-based cameras often struggle with stereo depth estimation
in rapidly changing scenes. In contrast, bio-inspired spike cameras emit
asynchronous events at microsecond-level resolution, providing an alternative
sensing modality. However, existing methods lack specialized stereo algorithms
and benchmarks tailored to the spike data. To address this gap, we propose
SpikeStereoNet, a brain-inspired framework and the first to estimate stereo
depth directly from raw spike streams. The model fuses raw spike streams from
two viewpoints and iteratively refines depth estimation through a recurrent
spiking neural network (RSNN) update module. To benchmark our approach, we
introduce a large-scale synthetic spike stream dataset and a real-world stereo
spike dataset with dense depth annotations. SpikeStereoNet outperforms existing
methods on both datasets by leveraging spike streams' ability to capture subtle
edges and intensity shifts in challenging regions such as textureless surfaces
and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore, our framework exhibits strong
data efficiency, maintaining high accuracy even with substantially reduced
training data. The source code and datasets will be publicly available.

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition (IID) is the task of separating an image into
albedo and shade. In real-world scenes, it is difficult to quantitatively
assess IID quality due to the unavailability of ground truth. The existing
method provides the relative reflection intensities based on human-judged
annotations. However, these annotations have challenges in subjectivity,
relative evaluation, and hue non-assessment. To address these, we propose a
concept of quantitative evaluation with a calculated albedo from a
hyperspectral imaging and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) intensity.
Additionally, we introduce an optional albedo densification approach based on
spectral similarity. This paper conducted a concept verification in a
laboratory environment, and suggested the feasibility of an objective,
absolute, and hue-aware assessment. (This paper is accepted by IEEE ICIP 2025.

Abstract: Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as a promising solution to address
distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification. However, existing methods
often rely on computationally expensive backpropagation during adaptation,
limiting their applicability in real-world, time-sensitive scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce SMART-PC, a skeleton-based framework that enhances
resilience to corruptions by leveraging the geometric structure of 3D point
clouds. During pre-training, our method predicts skeletal representations,
enabling the model to extract robust and meaningful geometric features that are
less sensitive to corruptions, thereby improving adaptability to test-time
distribution shifts. Unlike prior approaches, SMART-PC achieves real-time
adaptation by eliminating backpropagation and updating only BatchNorm
statistics, resulting in a lightweight and efficient framework capable of
achieving high frame-per-second rates while maintaining superior classification
performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including
ModelNet40-C, ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C, demonstrate that SMART-PC
achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing methods such as MATE
in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. The implementation is

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems have
rapidly evolved to tackle incremental recognition challenges in operational
settings. Data scarcity remains a major hurdle that conventional SAR-ATR
techniques struggle to address. To cope with this challenge, we propose a
few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) framework based on a dual-branch
architecture that focuses on local feature extraction and leverages the
discrete Fourier transform and global filters to capture long-term spatial
dependencies. This incorporates a lightweight cross-attention mechanism that
fuses domain-specific features with global dependencies to ensure robust
feature interaction, while maintaining computational efficiency by introducing
minimal scale-shift parameters. The framework combines focal loss for class

Abstract: While virtual try-on has achieved significant progress, evaluating these
models towards real-world scenarios remains a challenge. A comprehensive
benchmark is essential for three key reasons:(1) Current metrics inadequately
reflect human perception, particularly in unpaired try-on settings;(2)Most
existing test sets are limited to indoor scenarios, lacking complexity for
real-world evaluation; and (3) An ideal system should guide future advancements
in virtual try-on generation. To address these needs, we introduce VTBench, a
hierarchical benchmark suite that systematically decomposes virtual image
try-on into hierarchical, disentangled dimensions, each equipped with tailored
test sets and evaluation criteria. VTBench exhibits three key advantages:1)
Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework: The benchmark encompasses five critical
dimensions for virtual try-on generation (e.g., overall image quality, texture
preservation, complex background consistency, cross-category size adaptability,
and hand-occlusion handling). Granular evaluation metrics of corresponding test
sets pinpoint model capabilities and limitations across diverse, challenging
scenarios.2) Human Alignment: Human preference annotations are provided for
each test set, ensuring the benchmark's alignment with perceptual quality
across all evaluation dimensions. (3) Valuable Insights: Beyond standard indoor
settings, we analyze model performance variations across dimensions and
investigate the disparity between indoor and real-world try-on scenarios. To
foster the field of virtual try-on towards challenging real-world scenario,
VTBench will be open-sourced, including all test sets, evaluation protocols,
generated results, and human annotations.

Motivation: 现有视觉情感识别（VER）方法局限于单一领域，缺乏跨域泛化能力，因此需要一种无监督跨域方法。

Method: 提出KCDP框架，利用VLM对齐情感表示，并通过扩散模型增强视觉情感感知；使用CLIEA方法生成目标域的高质量伪标签。

Result: 实验显示KCDP在感知性和泛化性上优于现有方法，如比TGCA-PVT提升12%。

Conclusion: KCDP有效解决了UCDVER任务中的挑战，提升了跨域情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is a critical yet challenging task aimed at
inferring emotional states of individuals based on visual cues. However,
existing works focus on single domains, e.g., realistic images or stickers,
limiting VER models' cross-domain generalizability. To fill this gap, we
introduce an Unsupervised Cross-Domain Visual Emotion Recognition (UCDVER)
task, which aims to generalize visual emotion recognition from the source
domain (e.g., realistic images) to the low-resource target domain (e.g.,
stickers) in an unsupervised manner. Compared to the conventional unsupervised
domain adaptation problems, UCDVER presents two key challenges: a significant
emotional expression variability and an affective distribution shift. To
mitigate these issues, we propose the Knowledge-aligned
Counterfactual-enhancement Diffusion Perception (KCDP) framework. Specifically,
KCDP leverages a VLM to align emotional representations in a shared knowledge
space and guides diffusion models for improved visual affective perception.
Furthermore, a Counterfactual-Enhanced Language-image Emotional Alignment
(CLIEA) method generates high-quality pseudo-labels for the target domain.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses SOTA models in both
perceptibility and generalization, e.g., gaining 12% improvements over the SOTA
VER model TGCA-PVT. The project page is at https://yinwen2019.github.io/ucdver.

Abstract: Human-centered images often suffer from severe generic degradation during
transmission and are prone to human motion blur (HMB), making restoration
challenging. Existing research lacks sufficient focus on these issues, as both
problems often coexist in practice. To address this, we design a degradation
pipeline that simulates the coexistence of HMB and generic noise, generating
synthetic degraded data to train our proposed HAODiff, a human-aware one-step
diffusion. Specifically, we propose a triple-branch dual-prompt guidance (DPG),
which leverages high-quality images, residual noise (LQ minus HQ), and HMB
segmentation masks as training targets. It produces a positive-negative prompt
pair for classifier-free guidance (CFG) in a single diffusion step. The
resulting adaptive dual prompts let HAODiff exploit CFG more effectively,
boosting robustness against diverse degradations. For fair evaluation, we
introduce MPII-Test, a benchmark rich in combined noise and HMB cases.
Extensive experiments show that our HAODiff surpasses existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality on
synthetic and real-world datasets, including our introduced MPII-Test. Code is

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition aims at separating an image into its underlying
albedo and shading components, isolating the base color from lighting effects
to enable downstream applications such as virtual relighting and scene editing.
Despite the rise and success of learning-based approaches, intrinsic image
decomposition from real-world images remains a significant challenging task due
to the scarcity of labeled ground-truth data. Most existing solutions rely on
synthetic data as supervised setups, limiting their ability to generalize to
real-world scenes. Self-supervised methods, on the other hand, often produce
albedo maps that contain reflections and lack consistency under different
lighting conditions. To address this, we propose SAIL, an approach designed to
estimate albedo-like representations from single-view real-world images. We
repurpose the prior knowledge of a latent diffusion model for unconditioned
scene relighting as a surrogate objective for albedo estimation. To extract the
albedo, we introduce a novel intrinsic image decomposition fully formulated in
the latent space. To guide the training of our latent diffusion model, we
introduce regularization terms that constrain both the lighting-dependent and
independent components of our latent image decomposition. SAIL predicts stable
albedo under varying lighting conditions and generalizes to multiple scenes,
using only unlabeled multi-illumination data available online.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generalizable novel view synthesis have achieved
impressive quality through interpolation between nearby views. However,
rendering high-resolution images remains computationally intensive due to the
need for dense sampling of all rays. Recognizing that natural scenes are
typically piecewise smooth and sampling all rays is often redundant, we propose
a novel depth-guided bundle sampling strategy to accelerate rendering. By
grouping adjacent rays into a bundle and sampling them collectively, a shared
representation is generated for decoding all rays within the bundle. To further
optimize efficiency, our adaptive sampling strategy dynamically allocates
samples based on depth confidence, concentrating more samples in complex
regions while reducing them in smoother areas. When applied to ENeRF, our
method achieves up to a 1.27 dB PSNR improvement and a 47% increase in FPS on
the DTU dataset. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art rendering quality and up to 2x faster rendering

dedicated to normalization layers. In this work, we present a novel theoretical
framework for understanding the equivariance of normalization layers to
discrete shifts and continuous translations. We also determine necessary and
sufficient conditions for normalization layers to be equivariant in terms of
the dimensions they operate on. Using real feature maps from ResNet-18 and
ImageNet, we test those theoretical results empirically and find that they are
consistent with our predictions.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have transformed novel view synthesis by
modeling scene-specific volumetric representations directly from images. While
generalizable NeRF models can generate novel views across unknown scenes by
learning latent ray representations, their performance heavily depends on a
large number of multi-view observations. However, with limited input views,
these methods experience significant degradation in rendering quality. To
address this limitation, we propose GoLF-NRT: a Global and Local feature
Fusion-based Neural Rendering Transformer. GoLF-NRT enhances generalizable
neural rendering from few input views by leveraging a 3D transformer with
efficient sparse attention to capture global scene context. In parallel, it
integrates local geometric features extracted along the epipolar line, enabling
high-quality scene reconstruction from as few as 1 to 3 input views.
Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy based on attention
weights and kernel regression, improving the accuracy of transformer-based
neural rendering. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that GoLF-NRT
achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying numbers of input views,
highlighting the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. Code is

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis and
autonomous driving and has a problem with the high cost of annotating the
labels required in training. To address this problem, semantic segmentation
methods based on semi-supervised learning with a small number of labeled data
have been proposed. For example, one approach is to train a semantic
segmentation model using images with annotated labels and pseudo labels. In
this approach, the accuracy of the semantic segmentation model depends on the
quality of the pseudo labels, and the quality of the pseudo labels depends on
the performance of the model to be trained and the amount of data with
annotated labels. In this paper, we generate pseudo labels using zero-shot
annotation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP), improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels using the Unified
Dual-Stream Perturbations Approach (UniMatch), and use them as enhanced labels
to train a semantic segmentation model. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is demonstrated through the experiments using the public datasets:
PASCAL and MS COCO.

Motivation: Address the limitation of GS in 3D reconstruction with sparse input images by improving initialization of Gaussian primitives.

Method: Proposes Sparse2DGS, combining DUSt3R and COLMAP MVS to generate dense 3D point clouds for better Gaussian initialization.

Result: Achieves accurate 3D reconstruction from just three images on the DTU dataset.

Conclusion: Sparse2DGS effectively enhances GS for sparse image inputs, demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has gained attention as a fast and effective method
for novel view synthesis. It has also been applied to 3D reconstruction using
multi-view images and can achieve fast and accurate 3D reconstruction. However,
GS assumes that the input contains a large number of multi-view images, and
therefore, the reconstruction accuracy significantly decreases when only a
limited number of input images are available. One of the main reasons is the
insufficient number of 3D points in the sparse point cloud obtained through
Structure from Motion (SfM), which results in a poor initialization for
optimizing the Gaussian primitives. We propose a new 3D reconstruction method,
called Sparse2DGS, to enhance 2DGS in reconstructing objects using only three
images. Sparse2DGS employs DUSt3R, a fundamental model for stereo images, along
with COLMAP MVS to generate highly accurate and dense 3D point clouds, which
are then used to initialize 2D Gaussians. Through experiments on the DTU
dataset, we show that Sparse2DGS can accurately reconstruct the 3D shapes of
objects using just three images.

Abstract: The use of multi-view images acquired by a 360-degree camera can reconstruct
a 3D space with a wide area. There are 3D reconstruction methods from
equirectangular images based on NeRF and 3DGS, as well as Novel View Synthesis
(NVS) methods. On the other hand, it is necessary to overcome the large
distortion caused by the projection model of a 360-degree camera when
equirectangular images are used. In 3DGS-based methods, the large distortion of
the 360-degree camera model generates extremely large 3D Gaussians, resulting
in poor rendering accuracy. We propose ErpGS, which is Omnidirectional GS based
on 3DGS to realize NVS addressing the problems. ErpGS introduce some rendering
accuracy improvement techniques: geometric regularization, scale
regularization, and distortion-aware weights and a mask to suppress the effects
of obstacles in equirectangular images. Through experiments on public datasets,
we demonstrate that ErpGS can render novel view images more accurately than
conventional methods.

Abstract: Underwater images are often affected by complex degradations such as light
absorption, scattering, color casts, and artifacts, making enhancement critical
for effective object detection, recognition, and scene understanding in aquatic
environments. Existing methods, especially diffusion-based approaches,
typically rely on synthetic paired datasets due to the scarcity of real
underwater references, introducing bias and limiting generalization.
Furthermore, fine-tuning these models can degrade learned priors, resulting in
unrealistic enhancements due to domain shifts. To address these challenges, we
propose UDAN-CLIP, an image-to-image diffusion framework pre-trained on
synthetic underwater datasets and enhanced with a customized classifier based
on vision-language model, a spatial attention module, and a novel
CLIP-Diffusion loss. The classifier preserves natural in-air priors and
semantically guides the diffusion process, while the spatial attention module
focuses on correcting localized degradations such as haze and low contrast. The
proposed CLIP-Diffusion loss further strengthens visual-textual alignment and
helps maintain semantic consistency during enhancement. The proposed
contributions empower our UDAN-CLIP model to perform more effective underwater
image enhancement, producing results that are not only visually compelling but
also more realistic and detail-preserving. These improvements are consistently
validated through both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual comparisons,
demonstrating the model's ability to correct distortions and restore natural
appearance in challenging underwater conditions.

Abstract: For tasks such as urban digital twins, VR/AR/game scene design, or creating
synthetic films, the traditional industrial approach often involves manually
modeling scenes and using various rendering engines to complete the rendering
process. This approach typically requires high labor costs and hardware
demands, and can result in poor quality when replicating complex real-world
scenes. A more efficient approach is to use data from captured real-world
scenes, then apply reconstruction and rendering algorithms to quickly recreate
the authentic scene. However, current algorithms are unable to effectively
reconstruct and render real-world weather effects. To address this, we propose
a framework based on gaussian splatting, that can reconstruct real scenes and
render them under synthesized 4D weather effects. Our work can simulate various
common weather effects by applying Gaussians modeling and rendering techniques.
It supports continuous dynamic weather changes and can easily control the

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great potential in generating realistic image
detail. However, adapting these models to video super-resolution (VSR) remains
challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and lack of temporal modeling.
In this paper, we propose UltraVSR, a novel framework that enables
ultra-realistic and temporal-coherent VSR through an efficient one-step
diffusion space. A central component of UltraVSR is the Degradation-aware
Restoration Schedule (DRS), which estimates a degradation factor from the
low-resolution input and transforms iterative denoising process into a
single-step reconstruction from from low-resolution to high-resolution videos.
This design eliminates randomness from diffusion noise and significantly speeds
up inference. To ensure temporal consistency, we propose a lightweight yet
effective Recurrent Temporal Shift (RTS) module, composed of an RTS-convolution
unit and an RTS-attention unit. By partially shifting feature components along
the temporal dimension, these two units collaboratively facilitate effective
feature propagation, fusion, and alignment across neighboring frames, without
relying on explicit temporal layers. The RTS module is integrated into a
pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is further enhanced through
Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation (SJD), which improves temporal coherence

Motivation: 解决手势识别中处理新类别和旧类别时的灾难性遗忘问题，提升模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出PGPFR框架，包括伪特征生成（PFGBP）、变分原型重放（VPR）、截断交叉熵（TCE）和持续分类器重训练（CCRT）。

Result: 在两个数据集上，PGPFR比现有方法平均全局准确率提高了11.8%和12.8%。

Conclusion: PGPFR框架在类增量手势识别中表现出色，有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Gesture recognition is an important research area in the field of computer
vision. Most gesture recognition efforts focus on close-set scenarios, thereby
limiting the capacity to effectively handle unseen or novel gestures. We aim to
address class-incremental gesture recognition, which entails the ability to
accommodate new and previously unseen gestures over time. Specifically, we
introduce a Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay (PGPFR) framework for
data-free class-incremental gesture recognition. This framework comprises four
components: Pseudo Feature Generation with Batch Prototypes (PFGBP),
Variational Prototype Replay (VPR) for old classes, Truncated Cross-Entropy
(TCE) for new classes, and Continual Classifier Re-Training (CCRT). To tackle
the issue of catastrophic forgetting, the PFGBP dynamically generates a
diversity of pseudo features in an online manner, leveraging class prototypes
of old classes along with batch class prototypes of new classes. Furthermore,
the VPR enforces consistency between the classifier's weights and the
prototypes of old classes, leveraging class prototypes and covariance matrices
to enhance robustness and generalization capabilities. The TCE mitigates the
impact of domain differences of the classifier caused by pseudo features.
Finally, the CCRT training strategy is designed to prevent overfitting to new
classes and ensure the stability of features extracted from old classes.
Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used gesture recognition
datasets, namely SHREC 2017 3D and EgoGesture 3D, demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 11.8\% and 12.8\% in terms of
mean global accuracy, respectively. The code is available on

Result: PAMD显著提升了音乐对齐性和动作的物理真实性。

Conclusion: PAMD为舞蹈生成提供了更真实和物理可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Computational dance generation is crucial in many areas, such as art,
human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and digital entertainment,
particularly for generating coherent and expressive long dance sequences.
Diffusion-based music-to-dance generation has made significant progress, yet
existing methods still struggle to produce physically plausible motions. To
address this, we propose Plausibility-Aware Motion Diffusion (PAMD), a
framework for generating dances that are both musically aligned and physically
realistic. The core of PAMD lies in the Plausible Motion Constraint (PMC),
which leverages Neural Distance Fields (NDFs) to model the actual pose manifold
and guide generated motions toward a physically valid pose manifold. To provide
more effective guidance during generation, we incorporate Prior Motion Guidance
(PMG), which uses standing poses as auxiliary conditions alongside music
features. To further enhance realism for complex movements, we introduce the
Motion Refinement with Foot-ground Contact (MRFC) module, which addresses
foot-skating artifacts by bridging the gap between the optimization objective
in linear joint position space and the data representation in nonlinear
rotation space. Extensive experiments show that PAMD significantly improves
musical alignment and enhances the physical plausibility of generated motions.

Conclusion: HunyuanVideo-Avatar通过创新设计解决了音频驱动动画中的关键问题，实现了高质量的多角色视频生成。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in audio-driven human
animation. However, critical challenges remain in (i) generating highly dynamic
videos while preserving character consistency, (ii) achieving precise emotion
alignment between characters and audio, and (iii) enabling multi-character
audio-driven animation. To address these challenges, we propose
HunyuanVideo-Avatar, a multimodal diffusion transformer (MM-DiT)-based model
capable of simultaneously generating dynamic, emotion-controllable, and
multi-character dialogue videos. Concretely, HunyuanVideo-Avatar introduces
three key innovations: (i) A character image injection module is designed to
replace the conventional addition-based character conditioning scheme,
eliminating the inherent condition mismatch between training and inference.
This ensures the dynamic motion and strong character consistency; (ii) An Audio
Emotion Module (AEM) is introduced to extract and transfer the emotional cues
from an emotion reference image to the target generated video, enabling
fine-grained and accurate emotion style control; (iii) A Face-Aware Audio
Adapter (FAA) is proposed to isolate the audio-driven character with
latent-level face mask, enabling independent audio injection via
cross-attention for multi-character scenarios. These innovations empower
HunyuanVideo-Avatar to surpass state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets
and a newly proposed wild dataset, generating realistic avatars in dynamic,
immersive scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法为4D可变形物体的低维表示和操控提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The motion of deformable 4D objects lies in a low-dimensional manifold. To
better capture the low dimensionality and enable better controllability,
traditional methods have devised several heuristic-based methods, i.e.,
rigging, for manipulating dynamic objects in an intuitive fashion. However,
such representations are not scalable due to the need for expert knowledge of
specific categories. Instead, we study the automatic exploration of such
low-dimensional structures in a purely data-driven manner. Specifically, we
design a novel representation that encodes deformable 4D objects into a sparse
set of spatially grounded blobs and an instance-aware feature volume to
disentangle the pose and instance information of the 3D shape. With such a
representation, we can manipulate the pose of 3D objects intuitively by
modifying the parameters of the blobs, while preserving rich instance-specific
information. We evaluate the proposed method on a variety of object categories
and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Project page:

Abstract: Monkeypox is a viral disease characterized by distinctive skin lesions and
has been reported in many countries. The recent global outbreak has emphasized
the urgent need for scalable, accessible, and accurate diagnostic solutions to
support public health responses.
  In this study, we developed ITMAINN, an intelligent, AI-driven healthcare
system specifically designed to detect Monkeypox from skin lesion images using
advanced deep learning techniques. Our system consists of three main
components. First, we trained and evaluated several pretrained models using
transfer learning on publicly available skin lesion datasets to identify the
most effective models. For binary classification (Monkeypox vs. non-Monkeypox),
the Vision Transformer, MobileViT, Transformer-in-Transformer, and VGG16
achieved the highest performance, each with an accuracy and F1-score of 97.8%.
For multiclass classification, which contains images of patients with Monkeypox
and five other classes (chickenpox, measles, hand-foot-mouth disease, cowpox,
and healthy), ResNetViT and ViT Hybrid models achieved 92% accuracy, with F1
scores of 92.24% and 92.19%, respectively. The best-performing and most
lightweight model, MobileViT, was deployed within the mobile application. The
second component is a cross-platform smartphone application that enables users
to detect Monkeypox through image analysis, track symptoms, and receive
recommendations for nearby healthcare centers based on their location. The
third component is a real-time monitoring dashboard designed for health
authorities to support them in tracking cases, analyzing symptom trends,
guiding public health interventions, and taking proactive measures.
  This system is fundamental in developing responsive healthcare infrastructure
within smart cities. Our solution, ITMAINN, is part of revolutionizing public

Result: 实验表明，Pose Splatter能准确学习3D动物几何形状，捕捉细微姿态变化，并在低维姿态嵌入上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Pose Splatter消除了标注和逐帧优化的瓶颈，支持大规模、纵向行为分析。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable quantification of animal pose and appearance is crucial
for studying behavior. Current 3D pose estimation techniques, such as keypoint-
and mesh-based techniques, often face challenges including limited
representational detail, labor-intensive annotation requirements, and expensive
per-frame optimization. These limitations hinder the study of subtle movements
and can make large-scale analyses impractical. We propose Pose Splatter, a
novel framework leveraging shape carving and 3D Gaussian splatting to model the
complete pose and appearance of laboratory animals without prior knowledge of
animal geometry, per-frame optimization, or manual annotations. We also propose
a novel rotation-invariant visual embedding technique for encoding pose and
appearance, designed to be a plug-in replacement for 3D keypoint data in
downstream behavioral analyses. Experiments on datasets of mice, rats, and
zebra finches show Pose Splatter learns accurate 3D animal geometries. Notably,
Pose Splatter represents subtle variations in pose, provides better
low-dimensional pose embeddings over state-of-the-art as evaluated by humans,
and generalizes to unseen data. By eliminating annotation and per-frame
optimization bottlenecks, Pose Splatter enables analysis of large-scale,
longitudinal behavior needed to map genotype, neural activity, and
micro-behavior at unprecedented resolution.

Conclusion: C3R为IHC数据集间的跨数据集泛化提供了新途径，无需数据集特定的适应或重新训练。

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) images reveal detailed information about structures
and functions at the subcellular level. However, unlike natural images, IHC
datasets pose challenges for deep learning models due to their inconsistencies
in channel count and configuration, stemming from varying staining protocols
across laboratories and studies. Existing approaches build channel-adaptive
models, which unfortunately fail to support out-of-distribution (OOD)
evaluation across IHC datasets and cannot be applied in a true zero-shot
setting with mismatched channel counts. To address this, we introduce a
structured view of cellular image channels by grouping them into either context
or concept, where we treat the context channels as a reference to the concept
channels in the image. We leverage this context-concept principle to develop
Channel Conditioned Cell Representations (C3R), a framework designed for
unified evaluation on in-distribution (ID) and OOD datasets. C3R is a two-fold
framework comprising a channel-adaptive encoder architecture and a masked
knowledge distillation training strategy, both built around the context-concept
principle. We find that C3R outperforms existing benchmarks on both ID and OOD
tasks, while a trivial implementation of our core idea also outperforms the
channel-adaptive methods reported on the CHAMMI benchmark. Our method opens a
new pathway for cross-dataset generalization between IHC datasets, without
requiring dataset-specific adaptation or retraining.

Abstract: Over 8,024 wildfire incidents have been documented in 2024 alone, affecting
thousands of fatalities and significant damage to infrastructure and
ecosystems. Wildfires in the United States have inflicted devastating losses.
Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense, which highlights how urgently
efficient warning systems are needed to avoid disastrous outcomes. The goal of
this study is to enhance the accuracy of wildfire detection by using
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built on the VGG16 architecture. The D-FIRE
dataset, which includes several kinds of wildfire and non-wildfire images, was
employed in the study. Low-resolution images, dataset imbalance, and the
necessity for real-time applicability are some of the main challenges. These
problems were resolved by enriching the dataset using data augmentation
techniques and optimizing the VGG16 model for binary classification. The model
produced a low false negative rate, which is essential for reducing unexplored
fires, despite dataset boundaries. In order to help authorities execute fast
responses, this work shows that deep learning models such as VGG16 can offer a
reliable, automated approach for early wildfire recognition. For the purpose of
reducing the impact of wildfires, our future work will concentrate on
connecting to systems with real-time surveillance networks and enlarging the
dataset to cover more varied fire situations.

Abstract: We introduce FruitNeRF++, a novel fruit-counting approach that combines
contrastive learning with neural radiance fields to count fruits from
unstructured input photographs of orchards. Our work is based on FruitNeRF,
which employs a neural semantic field combined with a fruit-specific clustering
approach. The requirement for adaptation for each fruit type limits the
applicability of the method, and makes it difficult to use in practice. To lift
this limitation, we design a shape-agnostic multi-fruit counting framework,
that complements the RGB and semantic data with instance masks predicted by a
vision foundation model. The masks are used to encode the identity of each
fruit as instance embeddings into a neural instance field. By volumetrically
sampling the neural fields, we extract a point cloud embedded with the instance
features, which can be clustered in a fruit-agnostic manner to obtain the fruit
count. We evaluate our approach using a synthetic dataset containing apples,
plums, lemons, pears, peaches, and mangoes, as well as a real-world benchmark
apple dataset. Our results demonstrate that FruitNeRF++ is easier to control
and compares favorably to other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for monocular patient-to-image

intraoperative surgical frames through a lightweight neural network for
real-time cochlear implant surgery guidance via a zero-shot learning approach.
Unlike traditional methods, our framework seamlessly integrates with monocular
surgical microscopes, making it highly practical for clinical use without
additional hardware dependencies and requirements. Our method estimates camera
poses, which include a rotation matrix and a translation vector, by learning
from the synthetic dataset, enabling accurate and efficient intraoperative
registration. The proposed framework was evaluated on nine clinical cases using

angular error within 10 degrees in most cases, while also addressing
limitations of traditional methods, such as reliance on external tracking
systems or fiducial markers.

Abstract: Plankton are small drifting organisms found throughout the world's oceans.
One component of this plankton community is the zooplankton, which includes
gelatinous animals and crustaceans (e.g. shrimp), as well as the early life
stages (i.e., eggs and larvae) of many commercially important fishes. Being
able to monitor zooplankton abundances accurately and understand how
populations change in relation to ocean conditions is invaluable to marine
science research, with important implications for future marine seafood
productivity. While new imaging technologies generate massive amounts of video
data of zooplankton, analyzing them using general-purpose computer vision tools
developed for general objects turns out to be highly challenging due to the
high similarity in appearance between the zooplankton and its background (e.g.,
marine snow). In this work, we present the ZooplanktonBench, a benchmark
dataset containing images and videos of zooplankton associated with rich
geospatial metadata (e.g., geographic coordinates, depth, etc.) in various
water ecosystems. ZooplanktonBench defines a collection of tasks to detect,
classify, and track zooplankton in challenging settings, including highly
cluttered environments, living vs non-living classification, objects with
similar shapes, and relatively small objects. Our dataset presents unique
challenges and opportunities for state-of-the-art computer vision systems to
evolve and improve visual understanding in a dynamic environment with huge

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer worldwide. This cancer
caused 670,000 deaths globally in 2022, as reported by the WHO. Yet since
health officials began routine mammography screening in age groups deemed at
risk in the 1980s, breast cancer mortality has decreased by 40% in high-income
nations. Every day, a greater and greater number of people are receiving a
breast cancer diagnosis. Reducing cancer-related deaths requires early
detection and treatment. This paper compares two convolutional neural networks
called ConvNeXT and EfficientNet to predict the likelihood of cancer in
mammograms from screening exams. Preprocessing of the images, classification,
and performance evaluation are main parts of the whole procedure. Several
evaluation metrics were used to compare and evaluate the performance of the
models. The result shows that ConvNeXT generates better results with a 94.33%
AUC score, 93.36% accuracy, and 95.13% F-score compared to EfficientNet with a
92.34% AUC score, 91.47% accuracy, and 93.06% F-score on RSNA screening
mammography breast cancer dataset.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object tracking (MVMOT) has found widespread applications in
intelligent transportation, surveillance systems, and urban management.
However, existing studies rarely address genuinely free-viewpoint MVMOT
systems, which could significantly enhance the flexibility and scalability of
cooperative tracking systems. To bridge this gap, we first construct the
Multi-Drone Multi-Object Tracking (MDMOT) dataset, captured by mobile drone
swarms across diverse real-world scenarios, initially establishing the first
benchmark for multi-object tracking in arbitrary multi-view environment.
Building upon this foundation, we propose \textbf{FusionTrack}, an end-to-end
framework that reasonably integrates tracking and re-identification to leverage
multi-view information for robust trajectory association. Extensive experiments
on our MDMOT and other benchmark datasets demonstrate that FusionTrack achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both single-view and multi-view tracking.

Motivation: 传统方法需要密集多视图相机设置且计算资源消耗大，而选择性输入方法虽降低成本但牺牲质量。本文旨在实现高效、高质量的视图合成。

Method: 利用全局几何引导图像渲染流程，通过时间上的颜色差异掩码逐步优化深度图，并使用截断有符号距离场积累深度图，最后通过预训练混合网络融合多视图图像。

Result: 实现了视图和时间一致的高质量视频合成，且运行高效。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高效的同时，显著提升了视图和时间一致性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel geometry-guided online video view synthesis method with
enhanced view and temporal consistency. Traditional approaches achieve
high-quality synthesis from dense multi-view camera setups but require
significant computational resources. In contrast, selective-input methods
reduce this cost but often compromise quality, leading to multi-view and
temporal inconsistencies such as flickering artifacts. Our method addresses
this challenge to deliver efficient, high-quality novel-view synthesis with
view and temporal consistency. The key innovation of our approach lies in using
global geometry to guide an image-based rendering pipeline. To accomplish this,
we progressively refine depth maps using color difference masks across time.
These depth maps are then accumulated through truncated signed distance fields
in the synthesized view's image space. This depth representation is view and
temporally consistent, and is used to guide a pre-trained blending network that
fuses multiple forward-rendered input-view images. Thus, the network is
encouraged to output geometrically consistent synthesis results across multiple
views and time. Our approach achieves consistent, high-quality video synthesis,
while running efficiently in an online manner.

Conclusion: KSDiff是一种高效的全色锐化框架，可提升现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Pansharpening is a fundamental task in remote sensing that integrates
high-resolution panchromatic imagery (PAN) with low-resolution multispectral
imagery (LRMS) to produce an enhanced image with both high spatial and spectral
resolution. Despite significant progress in deep learning-based approaches,
existing methods often fail to capture the global priors inherent in remote
sensing data distributions. Diffusion-based models have recently emerged as
promising solutions due to their powerful distribution mapping capabilities;
however, they suffer from significant inference latency, which limits their
practical applicability. In this work, we propose the Kernel Space Diffusion
Model (KSDiff), a novel approach that leverages diffusion processes in a latent
space to generate convolutional kernels enriched with global contextual
information, thereby improving pansharpening quality while enabling faster
inference. Specifically, KSDiff constructs these kernels through the
integration of a low-rank core tensor generator and a unified factor generator,
orchestrated by a structure-aware multi-head attention mechanism. We further
introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for pansharpening, enabling
KSDiff to serve as a framework for enhancing existing pansharpening
architectures. Experiments on three widely used datasets, including
WorldView-3, GaoFen-2, and QuickBird, demonstrate the superior performance of
KSDiff both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code will be released upon
possible acceptance.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D hand mesh is challenging but an important task for
human-computer interaction and AR/VR applications. In particular, RGB and/or
depth cameras have been widely used in this task. However, methods using these
conventional cameras face challenges in low-light environments and during
motion blur. Thus, to address these limitations, event cameras have been
attracting attention in recent years for their high dynamic range and high
temporal resolution. Despite their advantages, event cameras are sensitive to
background noise or camera motion, which has limited existing studies to static
backgrounds and fixed cameras. In this study, we propose EventEgoHands, a novel
method for event-based 3D hand mesh reconstruction in an egocentric view. Our
approach introduces a Hand Segmentation Module that extracts hand regions,
effectively mitigating the influence of dynamic background events. We evaluated
our approach and demonstrated its effectiveness on the N-HOT3D dataset,

Conclusion: ADD框架显著提升了WLI图像分类性能，无需依赖息肉定位或显式对齐。

Abstract: White Light Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) are the two main
colonoscopic modalities for polyp classification. While NBI, as optical
chromoendoscopy, offers valuable vascular details, WLI remains the most common
and often the only available modality in resource-limited settings. However,
WLI-based methods typically underperform, limiting their clinical
applicability. Existing approaches transfer knowledge from NBI to WLI through
global feature alignment but often rely on cropped lesion regions, which are
susceptible to detection errors and neglect contextual and subtle diagnostic
cues. To address this, this paper proposes a novel holistic classification
framework that leverages full-image diagnosis without requiring polyp
localization. The key innovation lies in the Alignment-free Dense Distillation
(ADD) module, which enables fine-grained cross-domain knowledge distillation
regardless of misalignment between WLI and NBI images. Without resorting to
explicit image alignment, ADD learns pixel-wise cross-domain affinities to
establish correspondences between feature maps, guiding the distillation along
the most relevant pixel connections. To further enhance distillation
reliability, ADD incorporates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to filter
cross-domain affinities, ensuring the distillation path connects only those
semantically consistent regions with equal contributions to polyp diagnosis.
Extensive results on public and in-house datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, relatively outperforming the other approaches by
at least 2.5% and 16.2% in AUC, respectively. Code is available at:

Conclusion: ADD-SLAM无需预定义语义类别，能自适应发现场景动态，有效提升动态环境下的SLAM性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian-based
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods have demonstrated
exceptional localization precision and remarkable dense mapping performance.
However, dynamic objects introduce critical challenges by disrupting scene
consistency, leading to tracking drift and mapping artifacts. Existing methods
that employ semantic segmentation or object detection for dynamic
identification and filtering typically rely on predefined categorical priors,
while discarding dynamic scene information crucial for robotic applications
such as dynamic obstacle avoidance and environmental interaction. To overcome
these challenges, we propose ADD-SLAM: an Adaptive Dynamic Dense SLAM framework
based on Gaussian splitting. We design an adaptive dynamic identification
mechanism grounded in scene consistency analysis, comparing geometric and
textural discrepancies between real-time observations and historical maps. Ours
requires no predefined semantic category priors and adaptively discovers scene
dynamics. Precise dynamic object recognition effectively mitigates interference
from moving targets during localization. Furthermore, we propose a
dynamic-static separation mapping strategy that constructs a temporal Gaussian
model to achieve online incremental dynamic modeling. Experiments conducted on
multiple dynamic datasets demonstrate our method's flexible and accurate
dynamic segmentation capabilities, along with state-of-the-art performance in
both localization and mapping.

Abstract: Intra-operative data captured during image-guided surgery lacks sub-surface
information, where key regions of interest, such as vessels and tumors, reside.
Image-to-physical registration enables the fusion of pre-operative information
and intra-operative data, typically represented as a point cloud. However, this
registration process struggles due to partial visibility of the intra-operative
point cloud. In this research, we propose a patient-specific point cloud
completion approach to assist with the registration process. Specifically, we
leverage VN-OccNet to generate a complete liver surface from a partial
intra-operative point cloud. The network is trained in a patient-specific
manner, where simulated deformations from the pre-operative model are used to
train the model. First, we conduct an in-depth analysis of VN-OccNet's
rotation-equivariant property and its effectiveness in recovering complete
surfaces from partial intra-operative surfaces. Next, we integrate the
completed intra-operative surface into the Go-ICP registration algorithm to
demonstrate its utility in improving initial rigid registration outcomes. Our
results highlight the promise of this patient-specific completion approach in
mitigating the challenges posed by partial intra-operative visibility. The
rotation equivariant and surface generation capabilities of VN-OccNet hold
strong promise for developing robust registration frameworks for variations of
the intra-operative point cloud.

Abstract: Ratio-based biomarkers -- such as the proportion of necrotic tissue within a
tumor -- are widely used in clinical practice to support diagnosis, prognosis
and treatment planning. These biomarkers are typically estimated from soft
segmentation outputs by computing region-wise ratios. Despite the high-stakes
nature of clinical decision making, existing methods provide only point
estimates, offering no measure of uncertainty. In this work, we propose a
unified \textit{confidence-aware} framework for estimating ratio-based
biomarkers. We conduct a systematic analysis of error propagation in the
segmentation-to-biomarker pipeline and identify model miscalibration as the
dominant source of uncertainty. To mitigate this, we incorporate a lightweight,
post-hoc calibration module that can be applied using internal hospital data
without retraining. We leverage a tunable parameter $Q$ to control the
confidence level of the derived bounds, allowing adaptation towards clinical
practice. Extensive experiments show that our method produces statistically
sound confidence intervals, with tunable confidence levels, enabling more
trustworthy application of predictive biomarkers in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Self-supervised image denoising methods have garnered significant research
attention in recent years, for this kind of method reduces the requirement of
large training datasets. Compared to supervised methods, self-supervised
methods rely more on the prior embedded in deep networks themselves. As a
result, most of the self-supervised methods are designed with Convolution
Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures, which well capture one of the most
important image prior, translation equivariant prior. Inspired by the great
success achieved by the introduction of translational equivariance, in this
paper, we explore the way to further incorporate another important image prior.
Specifically, we first apply high-accuracy rotation equivariant convolution to
self-supervised image denoising. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we have
proved that simply replacing all the convolution layers with rotation
equivariant convolution layers would modify the network into its rotation
equivariant version. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
rotation equivariant image prior is introduced to self-supervised image
denoising at the network architecture level with a comprehensive theoretical
analysis of equivariance errors, which offers a new perspective to the field of
self-supervised image denoising. Moreover, to further improve the performance,
we design a new mask mechanism to fusion the output of rotation equivariant
network and vanilla CNN-based network, and construct an adaptive rotation
equivariant framework. Through extensive experiments on three typical methods,
we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Virtual try-on technology has become increasingly important in the fashion
and retail industries, enabling the generation of high-fidelity garment images
that adapt seamlessly to target human models. While existing methods have
achieved notable progress, they still face significant challenges in
maintaining consistency across different poses. Specifically, geometric
distortions lead to a lack of spatial consistency, mismatches in garment
structure and texture across poses result in semantic inconsistency, and the
loss or distortion of fine-grained details diminishes visual fidelity. To
address these challenges, we propose HF-VTON, a novel framework that ensures
high-fidelity virtual try-on performance across diverse poses. HF-VTON consists
of three key modules: (1) the Appearance-Preserving Warp Alignment Module
(APWAM), which aligns garments to human poses, addressing geometric
deformations and ensuring spatial consistency; (2) the Semantic Representation
and Comprehension Module (SRCM), which captures fine-grained garment attributes
and multi-pose data to enhance semantic representation, maintaining structural,
textural, and pattern consistency; and (3) the Multimodal Prior-Guided
Appearance Generation Module (MPAGM), which integrates multimodal features and
prior knowledge from pre-trained models to optimize appearance generation,
ensuring both semantic and geometric consistency. Additionally, to overcome
data limitations in existing benchmarks, we introduce the SAMP-VTONS dataset,
featuring multi-pose pairs and rich textual annotations for a more
comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that HF-VTON
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both VITON-HD and SAMP-VTONS, excelling

Abstract: Accurately delineating the visual pathway (VP) is crucial for understanding
the human visual system and diagnosing related disorders. Exploring
multi-parametric MR imaging data has been identified as an important way to
delineate VP. However, due to the complex cross-sequence relationships,
existing methods cannot effectively model the complementary information from
different MRI sequences. In addition, these existing methods heavily rely on
large training data with labels, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming to
obtain. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-parametric
feature decomposition framework for VP delineation. Specifically, a
correlation-constrained feature decomposition (CFD) is designed to handle the
complex cross-sequence relationships by capturing the unique characteristics of
each MRI sequence and easing the multi-parametric information fusion process.
Furthermore, a consistency-based sample enhancement (CSE) module is developed
to address the limited labeled data issue, by generating and promoting
meaningful edge information from unlabeled data. We validate our framework
using two public datasets, and one in-house Multi-Shell Diffusion MRI (MDM)
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in
terms of delineation performance when compared to seven state-of-the-art

Abstract: Accurate identification of acute cellular rejection (ACR) in endomyocardial
biopsies is essential for effective management of heart transplant patients.
However, the rarity of high-grade rejection cases (3R) presents a significant
challenge for training robust deep learning models. This work addresses the
class imbalance problem by leveraging synthetic data generation using StyleGAN
to augment the limited number of real 3R images. Prior to GAN training,
histogram equalization was applied to standardize image appearance and improve
the consistency of tissue representation. StyleGAN was trained on available 3R
biopsy patches and subsequently used to generate 10,000 realistic synthetic
images. These were combined with real 0R samples, that is samples without
rejection, in various configurations to train ResNet-18 classifiers for binary
rejection classification.
  Three classifier variants were evaluated: one trained on real 0R and
synthetic 3R images, another using both synthetic and additional real samples,
and a third trained solely on real data. All models were tested on an
independent set of real biopsy images. Results demonstrate that synthetic data
improves classification performance, particularly when used in combination with
real samples. The highest-performing model, which used both real and synthetic
images, achieved strong precision and recall for both classes. These findings
underscore the value of hybrid training strategies and highlight the potential
of GAN-based data augmentation in biomedical image analysis, especially in
domains constrained by limited annotated datasets.

extraction using the DINOv2 model named SuperAD. Our method carefully selects a
small number of normal reference images and constructs a memory bank by
leveraging the strong representational power of DINOv2. Anomalies are then

Recovery (M3DHMR) to directly estimate the positions of hand mesh vertices.
M3DHMR provides 2D cues for 3D tasks from a single image and uses a new spiral
decoder consist of several Dynamic Spiral Convolution (DSC) Layers and a Region
of Interest (ROI) Layer. On the one hand, DSC Layers adaptively adjust the
weights based on the vertex positions and extract the vertex features in both
spatial and channel dimensions. On the other hand, ROI Layer utilizes the
physical information and refines mesh vertices in each predefined hand region
separately. Extensive experiments on popular dataset FreiHAND demonstrate that
M3DHMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art real-time methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的全景图像数据集缺乏系统性和针对性，无法有效解决几何失真问题，因此需要一个新的数据集来推动技术进步。

Method: 通过Blender 3D生成多样且复杂的3D场景，提供全景RGB图像、相机参数、深度和法线图等地面真实数据。

Result: OB3D数据集为3D重建方法提供了严格的评估环境，并支持新技术的开发。

Conclusion: OB3D填补了现有数据集的空白，有助于提升全景图像3D重建的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in radiance field rendering, exemplified by Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have significantly
progressed 3D modeling and reconstruction. The use of multiple 360-degree
omnidirectional images for these tasks is increasingly favored due to
advantages in data acquisition and comprehensive scene capture. However, the
inherent geometric distortions in common omnidirectional representations, such
as equirectangular projection (particularly severe in polar regions and varying
with latitude), pose substantial challenges to achieving high-fidelity 3D
reconstructions. Current datasets, while valuable, often lack the specific
focus, scene composition, and ground truth granularity required to
systematically benchmark and drive progress in overcoming these
omnidirectional-specific challenges. To address this critical gap, we introduce
Omnidirectional Blender 3D (OB3D), a new synthetic dataset curated for
advancing 3D reconstruction from multiple omnidirectional images. OB3D features
diverse and complex 3D scenes generated from Blender 3D projects, with a
deliberate emphasis on challenging scenarios. The dataset provides
comprehensive ground truth, including omnidirectional RGB images, precise
omnidirectional camera parameters, and pixel-aligned equirectangular maps for
depth and normals, alongside evaluation metrics. By offering a controlled yet
challenging environment, OB3Daims to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of
existing methods and prompt the development of new techniques to enhance the
accuracy and reliability of 3D reconstruction from omnidirectional images.

Conclusion: HaloGS通过双表示设计，在3D重建与渲染中实现了效率与保真度的平衡。

Abstract: High fidelity 3D reconstruction and rendering hinge on capturing precise
geometry while preserving photo realistic detail. Most existing methods either
fuse these goals into a single cumbersome model or adopt hybrid schemes whose
uniform primitives lead to a trade off between efficiency and fidelity. In this
paper, we introduce HaloGS, a dual representation that loosely couples coarse
triangles for geometry with Gaussian primitives for appearance, motivated by
the lightweight classic geometry representations and their proven efficiency in
real world applications. Our design yields a compact yet expressive model
capable of photo realistic rendering across both indoor and outdoor
environments, seamlessly adapting to varying levels of scene complexity.
Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method yields
both compact, accurate geometry and high fidelity renderings, especially in
challenging scenarios where robust geometric structure make a clear difference.

Abstract: The increase in cardiac and pulmonary diseases presents an alarming and
pervasive health challenge on a global scale responsible for unexpected and
premature mortalities. In spite of how serious these conditions are, existing
methods of detection and treatment encounter challenges, particularly in
achieving timely diagnosis for effective medical intervention. Manual screening
processes commonly used for primary detection of cardiac and respiratory
problems face inherent limitations, increased by a scarcity of skilled medical
practitioners in remote or under-resourced areas. To address this, our study
introduces an innovative yet efficient model which integrates AI for diagnosing
lung and heart conditions concurrently using the auscultation sounds. Unlike
the already high-priced digital stethoscope, our proposed model has been
particularly designed to deploy on low-cost embedded devices and thus ensure
applicability in under-developed regions that actually face an issue of
accessing medical care. Our proposed model incorporates MFCC feature extraction
and engineering techniques to ensure that the signal is well analyzed for
accurate diagnostics through the hybrid model combining Gated Recurrent Unit
with CNN in processing audio signals recorded from the low-cost stethoscope.
Beyond its diagnostic capabilities, the model generates digital audio records
that facilitate in classifying six pulmonary and five cardiovascular diseases.
Hence, the integration of a cost effective stethoscope with an efficient AI
empowered model deployed on a web app providing real-time analysis, represents

Abstract: This paper proposes a tropical geometry-based edge detection framework that
reformulates convolution and gradient computations using min-plus and max-plus

contributing to sharper and more continuous edge representations. Three
variants are explored: an adaptive threshold-based method, a multi-kernel
min-plus method, and a max-plus method emphasizing structural continuity. The
framework integrates multi-scale processing, Hessian filtering, and wavelet
shrinkage to enhance edge transitions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Experiments on MATLAB built-in grayscale and color images suggest
that tropical formulations integrated with classical operators, such as Canny
and LoG, can improve boundary detection in low-contrast and textured regions.
Quantitative evaluation using standard edge metrics indicates favorable edge
clarity and structural coherence. These results highlight the potential of
tropical algebra as a scalable and noise-aware formulation for edge detection
in practical image analysis tasks.

Abstract: Cell boundary information is crucial for analyzing cell behaviors from
time-lapse microscopy videos. Existing supervised cell segmentation tools, such
as ImageJ, require tuning various parameters and rely on restrictive
assumptions about the shape of the objects. While recent supervised
segmentation tools based on convolutional neural networks enhance accuracy,
they depend on high-quality labelled images, making them unsuitable for
segmenting new types of objects not in the database. We developed a novel
unsupervised cell segmentation algorithm based on fast Gaussian processes for
noisy microscopy images without the need for parameter tuning or restrictive
assumptions about the shape of the object. We derived robust thresholding
criteria adaptive for heterogeneous images containing distinct brightness at
different parts to separate objects from the background, and employed watershed
segmentation to distinguish touching cell objects. Both simulated studies and
real-data analysis of large microscopy images demonstrate the scalability and
accuracy of our approach compared with the alternatives.

Motivation: 植被覆盖会干扰卫星图像中土壤反射率的准确测量，从而降低SOC估计的可靠性。研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用ReflectGAN框架，学习植被覆盖与裸土反射率之间的光谱转换，并使用LUCAS 2018数据集和Landsat 8图像进行训练。

Result: ReflectGAN生成的反射率输入显著提升了SOC估计模型的性能（如R²提高35%，RMSE降低43%）。

Conclusion: ReflectGAN在植被覆盖区域中提高了SOC估计的准确性，为土壤监测提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a critical indicator of soil health, but its
accurate estimation from satellite imagery is hindered in vegetated regions due
to spectral contamination from plant cover, which obscures soil reflectance and
reduces model reliability. This study proposes the Reflectance Transformation
Generative Adversarial Network (ReflectGAN), a novel paired GAN-based framework
designed to reconstruct accurate bare soil reflectance from vegetated soil
satellite observations. By learning the spectral transformation between
vegetated and bare soil reflectance, ReflectGAN facilitates more precise SOC
estimation under mixed land cover conditions. Using the LUCAS 2018 dataset and
corresponding Landsat 8 imagery, we trained multiple learning-based models on
both original and ReflectGAN-reconstructed reflectance inputs. Models trained
on ReflectGAN outputs consistently outperformed those using existing vegetation
correction methods. For example, the best-performing model (RF) achieved an
$R^2$ of 0.54, RMSE of 3.95, and RPD of 2.07 when applied to the
ReflectGAN-generated signals, representing a 35\% increase in $R^2$, a 43\%
reduction in RMSE, and a 43\% improvement in RPD compared to the best existing
method (PMM-SU). The performance of the models with ReflectGAN is also better
compared to their counterparts when applied to another dataset, i.e.,
Sentinel-2 imagery. These findings demonstrate the potential of ReflectGAN to
improve SOC estimation accuracy in vegetated landscapes, supporting more
reliable soil monitoring.

Conclusion: 为结构生物学中的少样本学习设定了新基准。

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a powerful technique for
imaging macromolecular complexes in their near-native states. However, the
localization of 3D particles in cellular environments still presents a
significant challenge due to low signal-to-noise ratios and missing wedge
artifacts. Deep learning approaches have shown great potential, but they need
huge amounts of data, which can be a challenge in cryo-ET scenarios where
labeled data is often scarce. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-augmented
and Self-interpreted (SaSi) deep learning approach towards few-shot particle
detection in 3D cryo-ET images. Our method builds upon self-augmentation
techniques to further boost data utilization and introduces a self-interpreted
segmentation strategy for alleviating dependency on labeled data, hence
improving generalization and robustness. As demonstrated by experiments
conducted on both simulated and real-world cryo-ET datasets, the SaSi approach
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for particle
localization. This research increases understanding of how to detect particles
with very few labels in cryo-ET and thus sets a new benchmark for few-shot
learning in structural biology.

Abstract: In laparoscopic surgery, a clear and high-quality visual field is critical
for surgeons to make accurate intraoperative decisions. However, persistent
visual degradation, including smoke generated by energy devices, lens fogging
from thermal gradients, and lens contamination due to blood or tissue fluid
splashes during surgical procedures, severely impair visual clarity. These
degenerations can seriously hinder surgical workflow and pose risks to patient
safety. To systematically investigate and address various forms of surgical
scene degradation, we introduce a real-world open-source surgical image
restoration dataset covering laparoscopic environments, called SurgClean, which
involves multi-type image restoration tasks, e.g., desmoking, defogging, and
desplashing. SurgClean comprises 1,020 images with diverse degradation types
and corresponding paired reference labels. Based on SurgClean, we establish a
standardized evaluation benchmark and provide performance for 22 representative
generic task-specific image restoration approaches, including 12 generic and 10
task-specific image restoration approaches. Experimental results reveal
substantial performance gaps relative to clinical requirements, highlighting a
critical opportunity for algorithm advancements in intelligent surgical
restoration. Furthermore, we explore the degradation discrepancies between
surgical and natural scenes from structural perception and semantic
understanding perspectives, providing fundamental insights for domain-specific
image restoration research. Our work aims to empower the capabilities of
restoration algorithms to increase surgical environments and improve the

Conclusion: PolyPose通过强归纳偏置实现了在挑战性场景下的成功配准，为术中3D引导提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is
a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric
imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization
of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures,
where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance
into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method
for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D
deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the
biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion.
Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail
outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces
anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise rigid nature of human
movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation
regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter
optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic
surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables
PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as
two X-ray images, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging
sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail.

Conclusion: BRITE为磁共振标记成像提供了一种亮度不变且准确的跟踪方法，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is an imaging technique for noninvasively
tracking tissue motion in vivo by creating a visible pattern of magnetization
saturation (tags) that deforms with the tissue. Due to longitudinal relaxation
and progression to steady-state, the tags and tissue brightnesses change over
time, which makes tracking with optical flow methods error-prone. Although
Fourier methods can alleviate these problems, they are also sensitive to
brightness changes as well as spectral spreading due to motion. To address
these problems, we introduce the brightness-invariant tracking estimation
(BRITE) technique for tagged MRI. BRITE disentangles the anatomy from the tag
pattern in the observed tagged image sequence and simultaneously estimates the
Lagrangian motion. The inherent ill-posedness of this problem is addressed by
leveraging the expressive power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models to
represent the probabilistic distribution of the underlying anatomy and the
flexibility of physics-informed neural networks to estimate
biologically-plausible motion. A set of tagged MR images of a gel phantom was
acquired with various tag periods and imaging flip angles to demonstrate the
impact of brightness variations and to validate our method. The results show
that BRITE achieves more accurate motion and strain estimates as compared to
other state of the art methods, while also being resistant to tag fading.

Motivation: 现代大型语言模型通过链式思维推理实现高性能，但这一机制可能放大欺骗性对齐问题，即模型表面对齐却暗中追求未对齐目标。现有安全方法仅事后过滤欺骗性输出，无法在推理过程中拦截。

Conclusion: CoT Monitor+通过实时自我监控有效减少欺骗性行为，为大型语言模型的安全性和透明度提供了新方向。

Abstract: Modern large language models rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to
achieve impressive performance, yet the same mechanism can amplify deceptive
alignment, situations in which a model appears aligned while covertly pursuing
misaligned goals. Existing safety pipelines treat deception as a black-box
output to be filtered post-hoc, leaving the model free to scheme during its
internal reasoning. We ask: Can deception be intercepted while the model is
thinking? We answer this question, the first framework that embeds a
Self-Monitor inside the CoT process itself, named CoT Monitor+. During
generation, the model produces (i) ordinary reasoning steps and (ii) an
internal self-evaluation signal trained to flag and suppress misaligned
strategies. The signal is used as an auxiliary reward in reinforcement
learning, creating a feedback loop that rewards honest reasoning and
discourages hidden goals. To study deceptive alignment systematically, we
introduce DeceptionBench, a five-category benchmark that probes covert
alignment-faking, sycophancy, etc. We evaluate various LLMs and show that
unrestricted CoT roughly aggravates the deceptive tendency. In contrast, CoT
Monitor+ cuts deceptive behaviors by 43.8% on average while preserving task
accuracy. Further, when the self-monitor signal replaces an external weak judge
in RL fine-tuning, models exhibit substantially fewer obfuscated thoughts and
retain transparency. Our project website can be found at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Universal Reasoner (UniR)的轻量级、可组合的推理模块，可与任何冻结的LLM结合使用，提升其推理能力，而无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在提升推理能力时需大量计算资源且可能损害泛化能力的问题，以及现有PEFT方法需针对不同LLM重新训练的局限性。

Method: UniR将奖励分解为独立的推理模块，通过预定义奖励训练，并将轨迹级信号转化为词级指导。训练后，UniR的输出logits可直接与LLM的logits相加。

Result: 在数学推理和机器翻译任务中，UniR显著优于现有基线方法，并展现出从小模型到大模型的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniR是一种高效、灵活且鲁棒的解决方案，可在不损害LLM核心能力的情况下提升其推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general
capabilities, but enhancing skills such as reasoning often demands substantial
computational resources and may compromise their generalization. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer a more resource-conscious
alternative, they typically requires retraining for each LLM backbone due to
architectural dependencies. To address these challenges, here we propose
Universal Reasoner (UniR) - a single, lightweight, composable, and
plug-and-play reasoning module that can be used with any frozen LLM to endow it
with specialized reasoning capabilities. Specifically, UniR decomposes the
reward into a standalone reasoning module that is trained independently using
predefined rewards, effectively translating trajectory-level signals into
token-level guidance. Once trained, UniR can be combined with any frozen LLM at
inference time by simply adding its output logits to those of the LLM backbone.
This additive structure naturally enables modular composition: multiple UniR
modules trained for different tasks can be jointly applied by summing their
logits, enabling complex reasoning via composition. Experimental results on
mathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks show that UniR
significantly outperforms \add{existing baseline fine-tuning methods using the
Llama3.2 model}. Furthermore, UniR demonstrates strong weak-to-strong
generalization: reasoning modules trained on smaller models effectively guide
much larger LLMs. This makes UniR a cost-efficient, adaptable, and robust
solution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs without compromising their core
capabilities. Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/hangeol/UniR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多步交互中因缺乏持久记忆而表现不佳，导致幻觉和误解，影响自主代理的可靠性。TME旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TME采用图结构记忆框架（树或DAG）替代线性上下文，结合Task Representation和Intent Management组件，支持多步推理和依赖跟踪。

Result: 在四个多步任务中，TME完全消除幻觉和误解，整体性能优于ReAct，幻觉减少66.7%，误解减少83.3%。

Conclusion: TME的模块化设计适用于多种场景，填补了LLM代理在复杂交互中的性能空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) falter in multi-step interactions -- often
hallucinating, repeating actions, or misinterpreting user corrections -- due to
reliance on linear, unstructured context. This fragility stems from the lack of
persistent memory to track evolving goals and task dependencies, undermining
trust in autonomous agents. We introduce the Task Memory Engine (TME), a
modular memory controller that transforms existing LLMs into robust,
revision-aware agents without fine-tuning. TME implements a spatial memory
framework that replaces flat context with graph-based structures to support
consistent, multi-turn reasoning. Departing from linear concatenation and
ReAct-style prompting, TME builds a dynamic task graph -- either a tree or
directed acyclic graph (DAG) -- to map user inputs to subtasks, align them with
prior context, and enable dependency-tracked revisions. Its Task Representation
and Intent Management (TRIM) component models task semantics and user intent to
ensure accurate interpretation. Across four multi-turn scenarios-trip planning,
cooking, meeting scheduling, and shopping cart editing -- TME eliminates 100%
of hallucinations and misinterpretations in three tasks, and reduces
hallucinations by 66.7% and misinterpretations by 83.3% across 27 user turns,
outperforming ReAct. TME's modular design supports plug-and-play deployment and
domain-specific customization, adaptable to both personal assistants and
enterprise automation. We release TME's codebase, benchmarks, and components as
open-source resources, enabling researchers to develop reliable LLM agents.
TME's scalable architecture addresses a critical gap in agent performance
across complex, interactive settings.

Method: 提出SynLogic框架，生成35种逻辑推理任务的数据，支持难度和数量的调整，并通过简单规则验证数据。

Conclusion: SynLogic是提升LLM推理能力的宝贵资源，已开源数据和合成框架。

Abstract: Recent advances such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated the
potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities in
Large Language Models (LLMs). While open-source replication efforts have
primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for
developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is
partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data
suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for
developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental
building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data
synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data
at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic
approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and
quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making
them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we
validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B
and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning
performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and
coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and
significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training
model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These
findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader
reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline
and the SynLogic dataset at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/SynLogic.

Motivation: 研究微调LLMs时推理能力的意外退化现象，即‘时间遗忘’，并寻找解决方案。

Method: 提出‘时间采样’解码策略，从训练轨迹的多个检查点生成输出，无需重新训练或集成。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，Pass@k提升4-19点，Majority@k持续提升。LoRA适配模型也验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ‘时间采样’是一种计算高效的方法，可挖掘隐藏推理能力，并重新思考LLMs评估方式。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is intended to improve their
reasoning capabilities, yet we uncover a counterintuitive effect: models often
forget how to solve problems they previously answered correctly during
training. We term this phenomenon temporal forgetting and show that it is
widespread across model sizes, fine-tuning methods (both Reinforcement Learning
and Supervised Fine-Tuning), and multiple reasoning benchmarks. To address this
gap, we introduce Temporal Sampling, a simple decoding strategy that draws
outputs from multiple checkpoints along the training trajectory. This approach
recovers forgotten solutions without retraining or ensembling, and leads to
substantial improvements in reasoning performance, gains from 4 to 19 points in
Pass@k and consistent gains in Majority@k across several benchmarks. We further
extend our method to LoRA-adapted models, demonstrating that storing only
adapter weights across checkpoints achieves similar benefits with minimal
storage cost. By leveraging the temporal diversity inherent in training,
Temporal Sampling offers a practical, compute-efficient way to surface hidden
reasoning ability and rethink how we evaluate LLMs.

Result: RASS能有效识别和缓解过度拒绝问题，并在多语言场景中扩展。MORBench评估集支持多语言模型评估。

Conclusion: RASS提供了更精确和可解释的安全决策视图，为LLMs的安全对齐提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet they often refuse to answer legitimate queries-a
phenomenon known as overrefusal. Overrefusal typically stems from
over-conservative safety alignment, causing models to treat many reasonable
prompts as potentially risky. To systematically understand this issue, we probe
and leverage the models'safety decision boundaries to analyze and mitigate
overrefusal. Our findings reveal that overrefusal is closely tied to
misalignment at these boundary regions, where models struggle to distinguish
subtle differences between benign and harmful content. Building on these
insights, we present RASS, an automated framework for prompt generation and
selection that strategically targets overrefusal prompts near the safety
boundary. By harnessing steering vectors in the representation space, RASS
efficiently identifies and curates boundary-aligned prompts, enabling more
effective and targeted mitigation of overrefusal. This approach not only
provides a more precise and interpretable view of model safety decisions but
also seamlessly extends to multilingual scenarios.We have explored the safety
decision boundaries of various LLMs and construct the MORBench evaluation set
to facilitate robust assessment of model safety and helpfulness across multiple
languages. Code and datasets will be released at

Conclusion: GraftLLM为跨能力转移提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-capability transfer is a key challenge in large language model (LLM)
research, with applications in multi-task integration, model compression, and
continual learning. Recent works like FuseLLM and FuseChat have demonstrated
the potential of transferring multiple model capabilities to lightweight
models, enhancing adaptability and efficiency, which motivates our
investigation into more efficient cross-capability transfer methods. However,
existing approaches primarily focus on small, homogeneous models, limiting
their applicability. For large, heterogeneous models, knowledge distillation
with full-parameter fine-tuning often overlooks the student model's intrinsic
capacity and risks catastrophic forgetting, while PEFT methods struggle to
effectively absorb knowledge from source LLMs. To address these issues, we
introduce GraftLLM, a novel method that stores source model capabilities in a
target model with SkillPack format. This approach preserves general
capabilities, reduces parameter conflicts, and supports forget-free continual
learning and model fusion. We employ a module-aware adaptive compression
strategy to compress parameter updates, ensuring efficient storage while
maintaining task-specific knowledge. The resulting SkillPack serves as a
compact and transferable knowledge carrier, ideal for heterogeneous model
fusion and continual learning. Experiments across various scenarios demonstrate
that GraftLLM outperforms existing techniques in knowledge transfer, knowledge
fusion, and forget-free learning, providing a scalable and efficient solution
for cross-capability transfer. The code is publicly available at:

Result: 在7个基准测试中提升4个MLLM性能18.1%，基线RLHF仅5.3%。

Conclusion: Generative RLHF-V显著提升对齐性能，且随候选响应数量增加呈近线性改进。

Abstract: Training multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that align with human
intentions is a long-term challenge. Traditional score-only reward models for
alignment suffer from low accuracy, weak generalization, and poor
interpretability, blocking the progress of alignment methods, e.g.,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Generative reward models
(GRMs) leverage MLLMs' intrinsic reasoning capabilities to discriminate
pair-wise responses, but their pair-wise paradigm makes it hard to generalize
to learnable rewards. We introduce Generative RLHF-V, a novel alignment
framework that integrates GRMs with multi-modal RLHF. We propose a two-stage
pipeline: $\textbf{multi-modal generative reward modeling from RL}$, where RL
guides GRMs to actively capture human intention, then predict the correct
pair-wise scores; and $\textbf{RL optimization from grouped comparison}$, which
enhances multi-modal RL scoring precision by grouped responses comparison.
Experimental results demonstrate that, besides out-of-distribution
generalization of RM discrimination, our framework improves 4 MLLMs'
performance across 7 benchmarks by $18.1\%$, while the baseline RLHF is only
$5.3\%$. We further validate that Generative RLHF-V achieves a near-linear
improvement with an increasing number of candidate responses. Our code and
models can be found at https://generative-rlhf-v.github.io.

Result: 实验表明Diffusion Blend优于基线，接近或超过单独微调模型的性能。

Conclusion: Diffusion Blend实现了高效、用户驱动的推理时对齐，适用于多目标场景。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been used recently to align
diffusion models with downstream objectives such as aesthetic quality and
text-image consistency by fine-tuning them to maximize a single reward function
under a fixed KL regularization. However, this approach is inherently
restrictive in practice, where alignment must balance multiple, often
conflicting objectives. Moreover, user preferences vary across prompts,
individuals, and deployment contexts, with varying tolerances for deviation
from a pre-trained base model. We address the problem of inference-time
multi-preference alignment: given a set of basis reward functions and a
reference KL regularization strength, can we design a fine-tuning procedure so
that, at inference time, it can generate images aligned with any user-specified
linear combination of rewards and regularization, without requiring additional
fine-tuning? We propose Diffusion Blend, a novel approach to solve
inference-time multi-preference alignment by blending backward diffusion
processes associated with fine-tuned models, and we instantiate this approach
with two algorithms: DB-MPA for multi-reward alignment and DB-KLA for KL
regularization control. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion Blend
algorithms consistently outperform relevant baselines and closely match or
exceed the performance of individually fine-tuned models, enabling efficient,
user-driven alignment at inference-time. The code is available at

Abstract: Probing techniques have shown promise in revealing how LLMs encode
human-interpretable concepts, particularly when applied to curated datasets.
However, the factors governing a dataset's suitability for effective probe
training are not well-understood. This study hypothesizes that probe
performance on such datasets reflects characteristics of both the LLM's
generated responses and its internal feature space. Through quantitative
analysis of probe performance and LLM response uncertainty across a series of
tasks, we find a strong correlation: improved probe performance consistently
corresponds to a reduction in response uncertainty, and vice versa.
Subsequently, we delve deeper into this correlation through the lens of feature
importance analysis. Our findings indicate that high LLM response variance is
associated with a larger set of important features, which poses a greater
challenge for probe models and often results in diminished performance.
Moreover, leveraging the insights from response uncertainty analysis, we are
able to identify concrete examples where LLM representations align with human
knowledge across diverse domains, offering additional evidence of interpretable
reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a dominant AI paradigm due to
their exceptional text understanding and generation capabilities. However,
their tendency to generate inconsistent or erroneous outputs challenges their
reliability, especially in high-stakes domains requiring accuracy and
trustworthiness. Existing research primarily focuses on detecting and
mitigating model misbehavior in general-purpose scenarios, often overlooking
the potential of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we
advance misbehavior detection by incorporating domain knowledge. The core idea
is to design a general specification language that enables domain experts to
customize domain-specific predicates in a lightweight and intuitive manner,
supporting later runtime verification of LLM outputs. To achieve this, we
design a novel specification language, ESL, and introduce a runtime
verification framework, RvLLM, to validate LLM output against domain-specific
constraints defined in ESL. We evaluate RvLLM on three representative tasks:
violation detection against Singapore Rapid Transit Systems Act, numerical
comparison, and inequality solving. Experimental results demonstrate that RvLLM
effectively detects erroneous outputs across various LLMs in a lightweight and
flexible manner. The results reveal that despite their impressive capabilities,
LLMs remain prone to low-level errors due to limited interpretability and a
lack of formal guarantees during inference, and our framework offers a
potential long-term solution by leveraging expert domain knowledge to
rigorously and efficiently verify LLM outputs.

the construction of coherent reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework based on Goal-Oriented Graphs (GoGs), where each node represents a
goal and its associated attributes, and edges encode logical dependencies
between goals. This structure enables explicit retrieval of reasoning paths by
first identifying high-level goals and recursively retrieving their subgoals,
forming coherent reasoning chains to guide LLM prompting. Our method

Abstract: Agents based on large language models leverage tools to modify environments,
revolutionizing how AI interacts with the physical world. Unlike traditional
NLP tasks that rely solely on historical dialogue for responses, these agents

research typically evaluates agents via multi-turn dialogues. However, it
overlooks the influence of these critical factors on agent behavior. To bridge
this gap, we present an open-source and high-quality benchmark $C^3$-Bench.
This benchmark integrates attack concepts and applies univariate analysis to
pinpoint key elements affecting agent robustness. In concrete, we design three
challenges: navigate complex tool relationships, handle critical hidden
information and manage dynamic decision paths. Complementing these challenges,
we introduce fine-grained metrics, innovative data collection algorithms and
reproducible evaluation methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on 49
mainstream agents, encompassing general fast-thinking, slow-thinking and
domain-specific models. We observe that agents have significant shortcomings in
handling tool dependencies, long context information dependencies and frequent

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models demonstrate impressive problem-solving
capabilities by employing sophisticated reasoning strategies. However, they
often struggle to balance efficiency and effectiveness, frequently generating
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains for simple problems. In this work, we
propose AdaCtrl, a novel framework to support both difficulty-aware adaptive
reasoning budget allocation and explicit user control over reasoning depth.
AdaCtrl dynamically adjusts its reasoning length based on self-assessed problem
difficulty, while also allowing users to manually control the budget to
prioritize either efficiency or effectiveness. This is achieved through a
two-stage training pipeline: an initial cold-start fine-tuning phase to instill
the ability to self-aware difficulty and adjust reasoning budget, followed by a
difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (RL) stage that refines the model's
adaptive reasoning strategies and calibrates its difficulty assessments based
on its evolving capabilities during online training. To enable intuitive user
interaction, we design explicit length-triggered tags that function as a
natural interface for budget control. Empirical results show that AdaCtrl
adapts reasoning length based on estimated difficulty, compared to the standard
training baseline that also incorporates fine-tuning and RL, it yields
performance improvements and simultaneously reduces response length by 10.06%
and 12.14% on the more challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, which
require elaborate reasoning, and by 62.05% and 91.04% on the MATH500 and GSM8K
datasets, where more concise responses are sufficient. Furthermore, AdaCtrl
enables precise user control over the reasoning budget, allowing for tailored
responses to meet specific needs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过在中间层注入指令层次信号（IH信号）的新方法，以增强大型语言模型（LLMs）对提示注入攻击的防御能力，相比现有方法显著降低了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示注入攻击是LLMs的重大安全漏洞，现有防御方法仅在初始输入层注入IH信号，限制了其在模型各层中的区分能力。

Method: 在中间层的令牌表示中注入IH信号，通过层特定的可训练嵌入编码权限信息。

Result: 在梯度基提示注入攻击中，攻击成功率降低了1.6倍至9.2倍，且不影响模型实用性。

Conclusion: 中间层注入IH信号的方法显著提升了防御效果，为LLMs的安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks are a critical security vulnerability in large
language models (LLMs), allowing attackers to hijack model behavior by
injecting malicious instructions within the input context. Recent defense
mechanisms have leveraged an Instruction Hierarchy (IH) Signal, often
implemented through special delimiter tokens or additive embeddings to denote
the privilege level of input tokens. However, these prior works typically
inject the IH signal exclusively at the initial input layer, which we
hypothesize limits its ability to effectively distinguish the privilege levels
of tokens as it propagates through the different layers of the model. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel approach that injects the IH
signal into the intermediate token representations within the network. Our
method augments these representations with layer-specific trainable embeddings
that encode the privilege information. Our evaluations across multiple models
and training methods reveal that our proposal yields between $1.6\times$ and
$9.2\times$ reduction in attack success rate on gradient-based prompt injection
attacks compared to state-of-the-art methods, without significantly degrading
the model's utility.

Abstract: Understanding and inferring causal relationships from texts is a core aspect
of human cognition and is essential for advancing large language models (LLMs)
towards artificial general intelligence. Existing work primarily focuses on
synthetically generated texts which involve simple causal relationships
explicitly mentioned in the text. This fails to reflect the complexities of
real-world tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs are capable of
inferring causal relationships from real-world texts. We develop a benchmark
drawn from real-world academic literature which includes diverse texts with
respect to length, complexity of relationships (different levels of
explicitness, number of events, and causal relationships), and domains and
sub-domains. To the best of our knowledge, our benchmark is the first-ever
real-world dataset for this task. Our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
evaluated on our proposed benchmark demonstrate significant challenges, with
the best-performing model achieving an average F1 score of only 0.477. Analysis
reveals common pitfalls: difficulty with implicitly stated information, in
distinguishing relevant causal factors from surrounding contextual details, and
with connecting causally relevant information spread across lengthy textual
passages. By systematically characterizing these deficiencies, our benchmark
offers targeted insights for further research into advancing LLM causal
reasoning.

Method: REACT分为两阶段：1)提取潜在事实表示并计算“信念偏移”向量；2)通过可控扰动调整隐藏状态，仅在必要时应用编辑。

Result: 在EVOKE、COUNTERFACT和MQuAKE基准测试中，REACT显著减少过拟合，同时保持编辑性能。

Conclusion: REACT提供了一种精确可控的知识编辑方法，有效减少过拟合并保持编辑效果。

Abstract: Large language model editing methods frequently suffer from overfitting,
wherein factual updates can propagate beyond their intended scope,
overemphasizing the edited target even when it's contextually inappropriate. To
address this challenge, we introduce REACT (Representation Extraction And
Controllable Tuning), a unified two-phase framework designed for precise and
controllable knowledge editing. In the initial phase, we utilize tailored
stimuli to extract latent factual representations and apply Principal Component
Analysis with a simple learnbale linear transformation to compute a directional
"belief shift" vector for each instance. In the second phase, we apply
controllable perturbations to hidden states using the obtained vector with a
magnitude scalar, gated by a pre-trained classifier that permits edits only
when contextually necessary. Relevant experiments on EVOKE benchmarks
demonstrate that REACT significantly reduces overfitting across nearly all
evaluation metrics, and experiments on COUNTERFACT and MQuAKE shows that our
method preserves balanced basic editing performance (reliability, locality, and
generality) under diverse editing scenarios.

Conclusion: 协作式方法在减少模型规模和训练资源的同时，显著提升了补丁任务的性能。

Abstract: Motivated by the success of general-purpose large language models (LLMs) in
software patching, recent works started to train specialized patching models.
Most works trained one model to handle the end-to-end patching pipeline
(including issue localization, patch generation, and patch validation).
However, it is hard for a small model to handle all tasks, as different
sub-tasks have different workflows and require different expertise. As such, by
using a 70 billion model, SOTA methods can only reach up to 41% resolved rate
on SWE-bench-Verified. Motivated by the collaborative nature, we propose
Co-PatcheR, the first collaborative patching system with small and specialized
reasoning models for individual components. Our key technique novelties are the
specific task designs and training recipes. First, we train a model for
localization and patch generation. Our localization pinpoints the suspicious
lines through a two-step procedure, and our generation combines patch
generation and critique. We then propose a hybrid patch validation that
includes two models for crafting issue-reproducing test cases with and without
assertions and judging patch correctness, followed by a majority vote-based
patch selection. Through extensive evaluation, we show that Co-PatcheR achieves
46% resolved rate on SWE-bench-Verified with only 3 x 14B models. This makes
Co-PatcheR the best patcher with specialized models, requiring the least
training resources and the smallest models. We conduct a comprehensive ablation
study to validate our recipes, as well as our choice of training data number,
model size, and testing-phase scaling strategy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to tackle complex
tasks, driven by their expanding applications and users' growing proficiency in
crafting sophisticated prompts. However, as the number of explicitly stated
requirements increases (particularly more than 10 constraints), LLMs often
struggle to accurately follow such complex instructions. To address this
challenge, we propose RECAST, a novel framework for synthesizing datasets where
each example incorporates far more constraints than those in existing
benchmarks. These constraints are extracted from real-world prompt-response
pairs to ensure practical relevance. RECAST enables automatic verification of
constraint satisfaction via rule-based validators for quantitative constraints
and LLM-based validators for qualitative ones. Using this framework, we
construct RECAST-30K, a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising 30k
instances spanning 15 constraint types. Experimental results demonstrate that
models fine-tuned on RECAST-30K show substantial improvements in following
complex instructions. Moreover, the verifiability provided by RECAST enables
the design of reward functions for reinforcement learning, which further boosts
model performance on complex and challenging tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks, sparking growing interest in
their application to preference reasoning in recommendation systems. Existing
methods typically rely on fine-tuning with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
data. However, these methods face significant practical limitations due to (1)
the difficulty of obtaining high-quality CoT data in recommendation and (2) the
high inference latency caused by generating CoT reasoning. In this work, we
explore an alternative approach that shifts from explicit CoT reasoning to
compact, information-dense latent reasoning. This approach eliminates the need
for explicit CoT generation and improves inference efficiency, as a small set
of latent tokens can effectively capture the entire reasoning process. Building
on this idea, we propose $\textit{\underline{R}einforced \underline{Latent}
\underline{R}easoning for \underline{R}ecommendation}$ (LatentR$^3$), a novel
end-to-end training framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize latent reasoning without relying on any CoT data.LatentR$^3$ adopts a
two-stage training strategy: first, supervised fine-tuning to initialize the
latent reasoning module, followed by pure RL training to encourage exploration
through a rule-based reward design. Our RL implementation is based on a
modified GRPO algorithm, which reduces computational overhead during training
and introduces continuous reward signals for more efficient learning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LatentR$^3$ enables effective latent reasoning
without any direct supervision of the reasoning process, significantly
improving performance when integrated with different LLM-based recommendation
methods. Our codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/R3-A278/.

GUARDIAN explicitly captures the propagation dynamics of hallucinations and

incremental training paradigm, learns to reconstruct node attributes and graph

grounded in human cognition, adds further support to the efficacy of
prompt-based steering and reveals privileged representational axes in LLMs

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities

conduct a systematic compositional probing study to evaluate whether current
VLMs trained with RL or other post-training strategies can compose capabilities
across modalities or tasks under out-of-distribution conditions. We design a
suite of diagnostic tasks that train models on unimodal tasks or isolated
reasoning skills, and evaluate them on multimodal, compositional variants
requiring skill integration. Through comparisons between supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and RL-trained models, we identify three key findings: (1) RL-trained
models consistently outperform SFT on compositional generalization,
demonstrating better integration of learned skills; (2) although VLMs achieve
strong performance on individual tasks, they struggle to generalize
compositionally under cross-modal and cross-task scenario, revealing a
significant gap in current training strategies; (3) enforcing models to
explicitly describe visual content before reasoning (e.g.,
caption-before-thinking), along with rewarding progressive vision-to-text
grounding, yields notable gains. It highlights two essential ingredients for
improving compositionality in VLMs: visual-to-text alignment and accurate

RL-based reasoning VLM training and provide actionable insights toward building

evaluation method that reduces bias when LLMs serve as evaluators in objective

Our evaluation reveals distinct capability patterns: (1) In Numerical
Calculation, Claude-3.5-Sonnet (63.18) and DeepSeek-R1 (64.04) lead, while
smaller models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B (15.92) lag significantly; (2) In Reasoning,

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their deployment often

However, this customization is sometimes accompanied by misleading claims about
the origins, raising significant concerns about transparency and trust within
the open-source community. Existing model verification techniques typically
assess functional, representational, and weight similarities. However, these
approaches often struggle against obfuscation techniques, such as permutations

detection method Origin-Tracer that rigorously determines whether a model has
been fine-tuned from a specified base model. This method includes the ability
to extract the LoRA rank utilized during the fine-tuning process, providing a
more robust verification framework. This framework is the first to provide a
formalized approach specifically aimed at pinpointing the sources of model
fine-tuning. We empirically validated our method on thirty-one diverse

framework amplifies biases sharply after the initial debate, and this increased
bias is sustained in subsequent rounds, while meta-judge approaches exhibit
greater resistance. We further investigate the incorporation of PINE, a leading
single-agent debiasing method, as a bias-free agent within these systems. The
results reveal that this bias-free agent effectively reduces biases in debate
settings but provides less benefit in meta-judge scenarios. Our work provides a
comprehensive study of bias behavior in multi-agent LLM-as-Judge systems and
highlights the need for targeted bias mitigation strategies in collaborative
evaluation settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reaching expert-level accuracy on medical
diagnosis questions, yet their mistakes and the biases behind them pose
life-critical risks. Bias linked to race, sex, and socioeconomic status is
already well known, but a consistent and automatic testbed for measuring it is
missing. To fill this gap, this paper presents AMQA -- an Adversarial Medical
Question-Answering dataset -- built for automated, large-scale bias evaluation
of LLMs in medical QA. AMQA includes 4,806 medical QA pairs sourced from the
United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) dataset, generated using a
multi-agent framework to create diverse adversarial descriptions and question
pairs. Using AMQA, we benchmark five representative LLMs and find surprisingly
substantial disparities: even GPT-4.1, the least biased model tested, answers
privileged-group questions over 10 percentage points more accurately than
unprivileged ones. Compared with the existing benchmark CPV, AMQA reveals 15%
larger accuracy gaps on average between privileged and unprivileged groups. Our
dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/XY-Showing/AMQA

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become deeply integrated into human life and
increasingly influence decision-making, it's crucial to evaluate whether and to
what extent they exhibit subjective preferences, opinions, and beliefs. These
tendencies may stem from biases within the models, which may shape their
behavior, influence the advice and recommendations they offer to users, and
potentially reinforce certain viewpoints. This paper presents the Preference,
Opinion, and Belief survey (POBs), a benchmark developed to assess LLMs'
subjective inclinations across societal, cultural, ethical, and personal
domains. We applied our benchmark to evaluate leading open- and closed-source
LLMs, measuring desired properties such as reliability, neutrality, and
consistency. In addition, we investigated the effect of increasing the
test-time compute, through reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms, on those
metrics. While effective in other tasks, our results show that these mechanisms
offer only limited gains in our domain. Furthermore, we reveal that newer model
versions are becoming less consistent and more biased toward specific
viewpoints, highlighting a blind spot and a concerning trend. POBS:

Result: 实验表明，TI-DPO在准确性和生成多样性上优于DPO和其他RLHF方法，且更稳定高效。

Conclusion: TI-DPO为LLM与人类偏好对齐提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) generate outputs aligned with
human preferences is important for safe and effective AI interactions. While
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) employs an implicit reward function to
optimize the policy model, however, it and its related variants overlook the
differential importance of individual tokens and are sensitive to judgment
noise in preference datasets during generation. Although recent methods attempt
to assess the important weight of tokens via probability prediction or
simplistic weighting schemes, these evaluation methods are prone to biases and
still cannot fully address these issues. To solve this problem, we propose the
Token-Importance Guided Direct Preference Optimization (TI-DPO), which
introduces two key innovations: the gradient-based token-importance weights
that dynamically prioritize critical tokens, and a triple loss that explicitly
guides model outputs to approach human-preferred responses and stay away from
non-preferred responses. Experimental results show that TI-DPO achieves higher
accuracy and stronger generative diversity, providing more stable and
computationally efficient solutions compared with DPO and other RLHF methods.

Abstract: Planning represents a fundamental capability of intelligent agents, requiring
comprehensive environmental understanding, rigorous logical reasoning, and
effective sequential decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable performance on certain planning tasks, their broader
application in this domain warrants systematic investigation. This paper
presents a comprehensive review of LLM-based planning. Specifically, this
survey is structured as follows: First, we establish the theoretical
foundations by introducing essential definitions and categories about automated
planning. Next, we provide a detailed taxonomy and analysis of contemporary
LLM-based planning methodologies, categorizing them into three principal
approaches: 1) External Module Augmented Methods that combine LLMs with
additional components for planning, 2) Finetuning-based Methods that involve
using trajectory data and feedback signals to adjust LLMs in order to improve
their planning abilities, and 3) Searching-based Methods that break down
complex tasks into simpler components, navigate the planning space, or enhance
decoding strategies to find the best solutions. Subsequently, we systematically
summarize existing evaluation frameworks, including benchmark datasets,
evaluation metrics and performance comparisons between representative planning
methods. Finally, we discuss the underlying mechanisms enabling LLM-based
planning and outline promising research directions for this rapidly evolving

Abstract: Despite the remarkable proficiency of \textit{Large Reasoning Models} (LRMs)
in handling complex reasoning tasks, their reliability in safety-critical
scenarios remains uncertain. Existing evaluations primarily assess
response-level safety, neglecting a critical issue we identify as
\textbf{\textit{Superficial Safety Alignment} (SSA)} -- a phenomenon where
models produce superficially safe outputs while internal reasoning processes
fail to genuinely detect and mitigate underlying risks, resulting in
inconsistent safety behaviors across multiple sampling attempts. To
systematically investigate SSA, we introduce \textbf{Beyond Safe Answers (BSA)}
bench, a novel benchmark comprising 2,000 challenging instances organized into
three distinct SSA scenario types and spanning nine risk categories, each
meticulously annotated with risk rationales. Evaluations of 19 state-of-the-art
LRMs demonstrate the difficulty of this benchmark, with top-performing models
achieving only 38.0\% accuracy in correctly identifying risk rationales. We
further explore the efficacy of safety rules, specialized fine-tuning on safety
reasoning data, and diverse decoding strategies in mitigating SSA. Our work
provides a comprehensive assessment tool for evaluating and improving safety
reasoning fidelity in LRMs, advancing the development of genuinely risk-aware

Motivation: 现有链式思维（CoT）蒸馏方法存在推理链冗长和无法适应问题难度的问题，导致推理成本高且模型无法学习自适应策略。

Method: 使用大模型判断问题难度并重写推理链为适当长度，生成简洁的推理示例数据集LiteCoT，并基于此训练小模型。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，使用更少推理令牌的难度感知CoT达到或优于传统长推理链的准确率。例如，在AIME24考试中达到74.2% Pass@1。

Conclusion: DAP方法显著降低了训练和推理成本，同时保持了性能，适用于高效推理模型的开发。

Abstract: Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation methods can effectively transfer
reasoning abilities to base models but suffer from two major limitations:
excessive verbosity of reasoning traces and inadequate adaptability to problem
difficulty. Long reasoning traces significantly increase inference costs, and
uniform-length solutions prevent base models from learning adaptive reasoning
strategies. To address these issues, we propose a difficulty-aware prompting
(DAP) method to dynamically shorten reasoning traces without performance loss.
In our approach, a large teacher model first judges each problem's difficulty
and then rewrites its reasoning traces to an appropriate shorter length,
yielding concise yet complete reasoning traces. Leveraging the DAP pipeline, we
curate a distilled dataset called LiteCoT consisting of 100K concise reasoning
examples, with solutions averaging only 720 tokens (an order of magnitude
shorter than typical CoTs). Using LiteCoT, we distilled a new family of
reasoning models called Liter (1.5B, 7B, and 32B) based on the Qwen2.5
architecture. Experiments show that a student model fine-tuned on just 100K of
these difficulty-pruned CoT samples outperforms a model distilled on 800K
original Long CoT samples, while significantly reducing training and inference
costs. Our method also generalizes well: across 11 diverse benchmarks, the
shorter difficulty-aware CoTs achieve equal or better accuracy than Long
chains, using far fewer tokens. For example, on the challenging AIME24 exam,
our approach reaches $74.2\%$ Pass@1 using only about 5K inference tokens,
surpassing other methods that consume many more tokens. Our code and data are
available at https://github.com/Evanwu1125/LiteCoT.

instructed by the high-level policy. This design decomposes complicated
problems into a series of coherent chain-of-thought reasoning sub-tasks,
providing flexible temporal abstraction to significantly enhance exploration
and learning for long-horizon tasks. Furthermore, GLIDER facilitates fast
online adaptation to non-stationary environments owing to the strong
transferability of its task-agnostic low-level skills. Experiments on
ScienceWorld and ALFWorld benchmarks show that GLIDER achieves consistent

Motivation: 解决Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)因冗长的CoT导致的高延迟问题，通过显式管理思考单元提升效率。

Method: 采用监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)范式，将CoT输出重构成多轮格式，并通过RL优化以减少轮数。

Result: 在MATH数据集上，MinD减少约70%的输出令牌和首令牌时间(TTFT)，同时在多个推理基准上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MinD通过多轮分解显式控制推理过程，显著提升效率且不影响性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are criticized for the excessively lengthy
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to derive the final answer, suffering from high
first-token and overall latency. Typically, the CoT of LRMs mixes multiple
thinking units; each unit attempts to produce a candidate answer to the
original query. Hence, a natural idea to improve efficiency is to reduce the
unit number. Yet, the fact that the thinking units in vanilla CoT cannot be
explicitly managed renders doing so challenging. This paper introduces
Multi-Turn Decomposition (MinD) to decode conventional CoT into a sequence of
explicit, structured, and turn-wise interactions to bridge the gap. In MinD,
the model provides a multi-turn response to the query, where each turn embraces
a thinking unit and yields a corresponding answer. The subsequent turns can
reflect, verify, revise, or explore alternative approaches to both the thinking
and answer parts of earlier ones. This not only makes the answer delivered more
swiftly, but also enables explicit controls over the iterative reasoning
process (i.e., users may halt or continue at any turn). We follow a supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) then reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to realize MinD. We
first rephrase the outputs of an LRM into multi-turn formats by prompting
another LLM, and then tune the LRM with such data. Observing that the tuned
model tends to consume even more tokens than the original one (probably due to
that the multi-turn formats introduce additional answer tokens), we advocate
leveraging RL algorithms like GRPO to prioritize correct outputs with fewer
turns. Trained on the MATH dataset using R1-Distill models, MinD can achieve up
to ~70% reduction in both output token usage and time to first token (TTFT),
while maintaining competitive performance on reasoning benchmarks such as
MATH-500, AIME24, AMC23, and GPQA-Diamond.

Conclusion: HS-STaR通过优化采样策略，有效提升了LLM的自我训练效率。

Abstract: Self-taught reasoners (STaRs) enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of
large language models (LLMs) by leveraging self-generated responses for
self-training. Recent studies have incorporated reward models to guide response
selection or decoding, aiming to obtain higher-quality data. However, they
typically allocate a uniform sampling budget across all problems, overlooking
the varying utility of problems at different difficulty levels. In this work,
we conduct an empirical study and find that problems near the boundary of the
LLM's reasoning capability offer significantly greater learning utility than
both easy and overly difficult ones. To identify and exploit such problems, we
propose HS-STaR, a Hierarchical Sampling framework for Self-Taught Reasoners.
Given a fixed sampling budget, HS-STaR first performs lightweight pre-sampling
with a reward-guided difficulty estimation strategy to efficiently identify
boundary-level problems. Subsequently, it dynamically reallocates the remaining
budget toward these high-utility problems during a re-sampling phase,
maximizing the generation of valuable training data. Extensive experiments
across multiple reasoning benchmarks and backbone LLMs demonstrate that HS-STaR
significantly outperforms other baselines without requiring additional sampling
budget.

Abstract: While foundation models update slowly due to resource-intensive training
requirements, domain-specific models evolve between updates. Model merging aims
to combine multiple expert models into a single, more capable model, thereby
reducing storage and serving costs while supporting decentralized model
development. Despite its potential, previous studies have primarily focused on
merging visual classification models or Large Language Models (LLMs) for code
and math tasks. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which extend the
capabilities of LLMs through large-scale multimodal training, have gained
traction. However, there lacks a benchmark for model merging research that
clearly divides the tasks for MLLM training and evaluation. In this paper, (i)
we introduce the model merging benchmark for MLLMs, which includes multiple
tasks such as VQA, Geometry, Chart, OCR, and Grounding, providing both LoRA and
full fine-tuning models. Moreover, we explore how model merging can combine
different modalities (e.g., vision-language, audio-language, and video-language
models), moving toward the Omni-language model. (ii) We implement 10 model
merging algorithms on the benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a novel method
that removes noise from task vectors and robustly optimizes the merged vector
based on a loss defined over task vector interactions, achieving an average
performance gain of 2.48%. (iii) We find that model merging offers a promising
way for building improved MLLMs without requiring data training. Our results
also demonstrate that the complementarity among multiple modalities outperforms
individual modalities.

different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and
(ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and planning are essential capabilities for large language
models (LLMs), yet most existing benchmarks evaluate them in isolation and
under limited forms of complexity. To address this gap, we introduce the
Temporal Constraint-based Planning (TCP) benchmark, that jointly assesses both
capabilities. Each instance in TCP features a naturalistic dialogue around a
collaborative project, where diverse and interdependent temporal constraints
are explicitly or implicitly expressed, and models must infer an optimal
schedule that satisfies all constraints. To construct TCP, we first generate
abstract problem prototypes that are paired with realistic scenarios from
various domains and enriched into dialogues using an LLM. A human quality check
is performed on a sampled subset to confirm the reliability of our benchmark.
We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and find that even the strongest models
struggle with TCP, highlighting its difficulty and revealing limitations in
LLMs' temporal constraint-based planning abilities. We analyze underlying
failure cases, open source our benchmark, and hope our findings can inspire
future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision making in
embodied agents, yet existing safety evaluations often rely on coarse success
rates and domain-specific setups, making it difficult to diagnose why and where
these models fail. This obscures our understanding of embodied safety and
limits the selective deployment of LLMs in high-risk physical environments. We
introduce SAFEL, the framework for systematically evaluating the physical
safety of LLMs in embodied decision making. SAFEL assesses two key
competencies: (1) rejecting unsafe commands via the Command Refusal Test, and
(2) generating safe and executable plans via the Plan Safety Test. Critically,
the latter is decomposed into functional modules, goal interpretation,
transition modeling, action sequencing, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of
safety failures. To support this framework, we introduce EMBODYGUARD, a
PDDL-grounded benchmark containing 942 LLM-generated scenarios covering both
overtly malicious and contextually hazardous instructions. Evaluation across 13
state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that while models often reject clearly unsafe
commands, they struggle to anticipate and mitigate subtle, situational risks.
Our results highlight critical limitations in current LLMs and provide a
foundation for more targeted, modular improvements in safe embodied reasoning.

Abstract: Reward models trained with conventional Reinforcement Learning from AI
Feedback (RLAIF) methods suffer from limited generalizability, which hinders
the alignment performance of the policy model during reinforcement learning
(RL). This challenge stems from various issues, including distribution shift,
preference label noise, and mismatches between overly challenging samples and
model capacity. In this paper, we attempt to enhance the generalizability of
reward models through a data-centric approach, driven by the insight that these
issues are inherently intertwined from the perspective of data difficulty. To
address this, we propose a novel framework, $\textit{Curriculum-RLAIF}$, which
constructs preference pairs with varying difficulty levels and produces a
curriculum that progressively incorporates preference pairs of increasing
difficulty for reward model training. Our experimental results suggest that
reward models trained with Curriculum-RLAIF achieve improved generalizability,
significantly increasing the alignment performance of the policy model by a
large margin without incurring additional inference costs compared to various
non-curriculum baselines. Detailed analysis and comparisons with alternative
approaches, including data selection via external pretrained reward models or
internal self-selection mechanisms, as well as other curriculum strategies,
further demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of simplicity,
efficiency, and effectiveness.

Abstract: Reasoning-based language models have demonstrated strong performance across
various domains, with the most notable gains seen in mathematical and coding
tasks. Recent research has shown that reasoning also offers significant
benefits for LLM safety and guardrail applications. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of training reasoning-based guardrail models for content
moderation, with an emphasis on generalization to custom safety policies at
inference time. Our study focuses on two key dimensions: data efficiency and
inference efficiency. On the data front, we find that reasoning-based models
exhibit strong sample efficiency, achieving competitive performance with
significantly fewer training examples than their non-reasoning counterparts.
This unlocks the potential to repurpose the remaining data for mining
high-value, difficult samples that further enhance model performance. On the
inference side, we evaluate practical trade-offs by introducing reasoning
budgets, examining the impact of reasoning length on latency and accuracy, and
exploring dual-mode training to allow runtime control over reasoning behavior.
Our findings will provide practical insights for researchers and developers to
effectively and efficiently train and deploy reasoning-based guardrails models
in real-world systems.

Abstract: AI agents that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly
becoming core building blocks of modern software systems. A wide range of
frameworks is now available to support the specification of such applications.
These frameworks enable the definition of agent setups using natural language
prompting, which specifies the roles, goals, and tools assigned to the various
agents involved. Within such setups, agent behavior is non-deterministic for
any given input, highlighting the critical need for robust debugging and
observability tools. In this work, we explore the use of process and causal
discovery applied to agent execution trajectories as a means of enhancing
developer observability. This approach aids in monitoring and understanding the
emergent variability in agent behavior. Additionally, we complement this with
LLM-based static analysis techniques to distinguish between intended and
unintended behavioral variability. We argue that such instrumentation is
essential for giving developers greater control over evolving specifications
and for identifying aspects of functionality that may require more precise and
explicit definitions.

Method: 评估了500多个攻击者-目标模型对，使用基于LLM的越狱攻击模拟人类红队行为，分析能力差距对攻击成功率的影响。

Result: 发现三个趋势：能力更强的模型是更好的攻击者；目标能力超过攻击者时攻击成功率骤降；攻击成功率与MMLU-Pro社会科学部分表现相关。

Conclusion: 固定能力的攻击者（如人类）可能对未来模型无效，开源模型能力提升会增加风险，需准确测量和控制模型的操纵能力。

Abstract: As large language models grow in capability and agency, identifying
vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes vital for safe deployment. However,
traditional prompt-engineering approaches may prove ineffective once
red-teaming turns into a weak-to-strong problem, where target models surpass
red-teamers in capabilities. To study this shift, we frame red-teaming through
the lens of the capability gap between attacker and target. We evaluate more
than 500 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic
human red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three
strong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack
success drops sharply once the target's capability exceeds the attacker's, and
(iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science
splits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these trends, we derive a jailbreaking
scaling law that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on
attacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability
attackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models,
increasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and
model providers must accurately measure and control models' persuasive and
manipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.

Conclusion: POET有效解决了LLMs计算错误问题，显著提升了代数问题求解的准确性。

Abstract: Solving algebraic word problems (AWPs) has recently emerged as an important
natural language processing task. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated powerful mathematical capabilities, and the Chain-of-Thought
technique, which guides LLMs through step-by-step reasoning, has yielded
impressive results. However, this reasoning ability is limited by the
computational weaknesses of LLMs themselves, where calculation errors can
accumulate, leading to incorrect final answers. To address this, we propose
Program of Equations Thoughts (POET), which transforms the task of generating
step-by-step reasoning answers into a two-stage task of predicting equations
and generating code, offloading complex computations to a Python interpreter to
avoid calculation errors in LLMs. Furthermore, we propose Zero-shot POET, which
utilizes a manually designed template to enable LLMs to directly generate
Python code for one-step solving. Our method achieves accuracies of 95.3% and
98.0% on the PEN and ALG514 datasets, respectively, setting a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA). Zero-shot POET also achieves the SOTA result of 95.5%

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to
autonomously perform complex, open-ended tasks. However, many existing
frameworks depend heavily on manually predefined tools and workflows, which
hinder their adaptability, scalability, and generalization across domains. In
this work, we introduce Alita--a generalist agent designed with the principle
of "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication," enabling scalable agentic
reasoning through minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution. For minimal
predefinition, Alita is equipped with only one component for direct
problem-solving, making it much simpler and neater than previous approaches
that relied heavily on hand-crafted, elaborate tools and workflows. This clean
design enhances its potential to generalize to challenging questions, without
being limited by tools. For Maximal self-evolution, we enable the creativity of
Alita by providing a suite of general-purpose components to autonomously
construct, refine, and reuse external capabilities by generating task-related
model context protocols (MCPs) from open source, which contributes to scalable
agentic reasoning. Notably, Alita achieves 75.15% pass@1 and 87.27% pass@3
accuracy, which is top-ranking among general-purpose agents, on the GAIA
benchmark validation dataset, 74.00% and 52.00% pass@1, respectively, on

research, and everyday life. But with that growth comes new risks, especially
prompt-based attacks that exploit how these models process language. InjectLab

InjectLab as a structured, open-source matrix that maps real-world techniques
used to manipulate LLMs. The framework is inspired by MITRE ATT&CK and focuses
specifically on adversarial behavior at the prompt layer. It includes over 25
techniques organized under six core tactics, covering threats like instruction
override, identity swapping, and multi-agent exploitation. Each technique in
InjectLab includes detection guidance, mitigation strategies, and YAML-based
simulation tests. A Python tool supports easy execution of prompt-based test
cases. This paper outlines the framework's structure, compares it to other AI
threat taxonomies, and discusses its future direction as a practical,
community-driven foundation for securing language models.

Conclusion: 结论强调了LLMs在安全防护上的不足，尤其是在高风险领域的应用，呼吁未来研究加强模型的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite their staggering capabilities as assistant tools, often exceeding
human performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) are still prone to jailbreak
attempts from malevolent users. Although red teaming practices have already
identified and helped to address several such jailbreak techniques, one
particular sturdy approach involving role-playing (which we named `Goofy Game')
seems effective against most of the current LLMs safeguards. This can result in
the provision of unsafe content, which, although not harmful per se, might lead
to dangerous consequences if delivered in a setting such as the medical domain.
In this preliminary and exploratory study, we provide an initial analysis of
how, even without technical knowledge of the internal architecture and
parameters of generative AI models, a malicious user could construct a
role-playing prompt capable of coercing an LLM into producing incorrect (and
potentially harmful) clinical suggestions. We aim to illustrate a specific
vulnerability scenario, providing insights that can support future advancements

Abstract: Complex tasks are increasingly delegated to ensembles of specialized
LLM-based agents that reason, communicate, and coordinate actions-both among
themselves and through interactions with external tools, APIs, and databases.
While persistent memory has been shown to enhance single-agent performance,
most approaches assume a monolithic, single-user context-overlooking the
benefits and challenges of knowledge transfer across users under dynamic,
asymmetric permissions. We introduce Collaborative Memory, a framework for
multi-user, multi-agent environments with asymmetric, time-evolving access
controls encoded as bipartite graphs linking users, agents, and resources. Our
system maintains two memory tiers: (1) private memory-private fragments visible
only to their originating user; and (2) shared memory-selectively shared
fragments. Each fragment carries immutable provenance attributes (contributing
agents, accessed resources, and timestamps) to support retrospective permission
checks. Granular read policies enforce current user-agent-resource constraints
and project existing memory fragments into filtered transformed views. Write
policies determine fragment retention and sharing, applying context-aware
transformations to update the memory. Both policies may be designed conditioned
on system, agent, and user-level information. Our framework enables safe,
efficient, and interpretable cross-user knowledge sharing, with provable
adherence to asymmetric, time-varying policies and full auditability of memory
operations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, and
several defenses have recently been proposed, often claiming to mitigate these

against both existing and adaptive prompt injection attacks involving diverse
target and injected prompts, and (2) general-purpose utility, ensuring that the
defense does not compromise the foundational capabilities of the LLM. Our
critical evaluation reveals that prior studies have not followed such a
comprehensive evaluation methodology. When assessed using this principled

Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) services increasingly rely on complex,
often abstract operations, such as multi-step reasoning and multi-agent
collaboration, to generate high-quality outputs. While users are billed based
on token consumption and API usage, these internal steps are typically not
visible. We refer to such systems as Commercial Opaque LLM Services (COLS).
This position paper highlights emerging accountability challenges in COLS:
users are billed for operations they cannot observe, verify, or contest. We
formalize two key risks: \textit{quantity inflation}, where token and call
counts may be artificially inflated, and \textit{quality downgrade}, where
providers might quietly substitute lower-cost models or tools. Addressing these
risks requires a diverse set of auditing strategies, including
commitment-based, predictive, behavioral, and signature-based methods. We
further explore the potential of complementary mechanisms such as watermarking
and trusted execution environments to enhance verifiability without
compromising provider confidentiality. We also propose a modular three-layer
auditing framework for COLS and users that enables trustworthy verification
across execution, secure logging, and user-facing auditability without exposing
proprietary internals. Our aim is to encourage further research and policy
development toward transparency, auditability, and accountability in commercial
LLM services.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized algorithm development, yet
their application in symbolic regression, where algorithms automatically
discover symbolic expressions from data, remains constrained and is typically
designed manually by human experts. In this paper, we propose a
learning-to-evolve framework that enables LLMs to automatically design
selection operators for evolutionary symbolic regression algorithms. We first
identify two key limitations in existing LLM-based algorithm evolution
techniques: code bloat and a lack of semantic guidance. Bloat results in
unnecessarily complex components, and the absence of semantic awareness can
lead to ineffective exchange of useful code components, both of which can
reduce the interpretability of the designed algorithm or hinder evolutionary
learning progress. To address these issues, we enhance the LLM-based evolution
framework for meta symbolic regression with two key innovations: bloat control
and a complementary, semantics-aware selection operator. Additionally, we embed
domain knowledge into the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate more effective
and contextually relevant selection operators. Our experimental results on
symbolic regression benchmarks show that LLMs can devise selection operators
that outperform nine expert-designed baselines, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. This demonstrates that LLMs can exceed expert-level algorithm
design for symbolic regression.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness in code
generation tasks. To enable LLMs to address more complex coding challenges,
existing research has focused on crafting multi-agent systems with agentic
workflows, where complex coding tasks are decomposed into sub-tasks, assigned
to specialized agents. Despite their effectiveness, current approaches heavily
rely on hand-crafted agentic workflows, with both agent topologies and prompts
manually designed, which limits their ability to automatically adapt to
different types of coding problems. To address these limitations and enable
automated workflow design, we propose \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}volving
\textbf{W}orkflow (\textbf{SEW}), a novel self-evolving framework that
automatically generates and optimises multi-agent workflows. Extensive
experiments on three coding benchmark datasets, including the challenging
LiveCodeBench, demonstrate that our SEW can automatically design agentic
workflows and optimise them through self-evolution, bringing up to 33\%
improvement on LiveCodeBench compared to using the backbone LLM only.
Furthermore, by investigating different representation schemes of workflow, we
provide insights into the optimal way to encode workflow information with text.

Abstract: Selecting artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as large language models
(LLMs), from multiple candidates requires accurate performance estimation. This
is ideally achieved through empirical evaluations involving abundant real-world
data. However, such evaluations are costly and impractical at scale. To address
this challenge, autoevaluation methods leverage synthetic data produced by
automated evaluators, such as LLMs-as-judges, reducing variance but potentially
introducing bias. Recent approaches have employed semi-supervised
prediction-powered inference (\texttt{PPI}) to correct for the bias of
autoevaluators. However, the use of autoevaluators may lead in practice to a
degradation in sample efficiency compared to conventional methods using only
real-world data. In this paper, we propose \texttt{R-AutoEval+}, a novel
framework that provides finite-sample reliability guarantees on the model
evaluation, while also ensuring an enhanced (or at least no worse) sample
efficiency compared to conventional methods. The key innovation of
\texttt{R-AutoEval+} is an adaptive construction of the model evaluation
variable, which dynamically tunes its reliance on synthetic data, reverting to

TL;DR: GainRAG提出了一种新方法，通过定义“增益”指标来对齐检索器和LLM的偏好，解决了RAG框架中检索器与LLM偏好不一致的问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG框架中检索器与LLM的偏好不一致，限制了系统性能的进一步提升。一些高相关性段落可能干扰LLM推理，而间接相关或不准确内容反而可能帮助LLM生成更准确的答案。

Method: 提出GainRAG，定义“增益”指标衡量输入段落对正确输出的贡献，估计增益信号并训练中间件对齐检索器和LLM的偏好，同时引入伪段落策略缓解退化。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验验证了GainRAG的有效性。

Conclusion: GainRAG通过对齐检索器和LLM的偏好，显著提升了RAG框架的性能。

Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework introduces a retrieval
module to dynamically inject retrieved information into the input context of
large language models (LLMs), and has demonstrated significant success in
various NLP tasks. However, the current study points out that there is a
preference gap between retrievers and LLMs in the RAG framework, which limit
the further improvement of system performance. Some highly relevant passages
may interfere with LLM reasoning because they contain complex or contradictory
information; while some indirectly related or even inaccurate content may help
LLM generate more accurate answers by providing suggestive information or
logical clues. To solve this, we propose GainRAG, a novel approach that aligns
the retriever's and LLM's preferences by defining a new metric, "gain", which
measure how well an input passage contributes to correct outputs. Specifically,
we propose a method to estimate these gain signals and train a middleware that
aligns the preferences of the retriever and the LLM using only limited data. In
addition, we introduce a pseudo-passage strategy to mitigate degradation. The
experimental results on 6 datasets verify the effectiveness of GainRAG.

Result: 揭示了LLMs的多类安全风险及现有防御的不足，强调需多层面安全策略。

Conclusion: 需推进稳健的多层安全策略以确保LLMs的安全性和有益性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 (and its recent iterations like
GPT-4o and the GPT-4.1 series), Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude 3 models,
and xAI's Grok have caused a revolution in natural language processing, but
their capabilities also introduce new security vulnerabilities. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging security concerns around
LLMs, categorizing threats into prompt injection and jailbreaking, adversarial
attacks (including input perturbations and data poisoning), misuse by malicious
actors (e.g., for disinformation, phishing, and malware generation), and
worrisome risks inherent in autonomous LLM agents. A significant focus has been
recently placed on the latter, exploring goal misalignment, emergent deception,
self-preservation instincts, and the potential for LLMs to develop and pursue
covert, misaligned objectives (scheming), which may even persist through safety
training. We summarize recent academic and industrial studies (2022-2025) that
exemplify each threat, analyze proposed defenses and their limitations, and
identify open challenges in securing LLM-based applications. We conclude by
emphasizing the importance of advancing robust, multi-layered security
strategies to ensure LLMs are safe and beneficial.

Conclusion: FastMamba通过协同设计显著提升了Mamba2在边缘设备上的部署效率和性能。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), like recent Mamba2, have achieved remarkable
performance and received extensive attention. However, deploying Mamba2 on
resource-constrained edge devices encounters many problems: severe outliers
within the linear layer challenging the quantization, diverse and irregular
element-wise tensor operations, and hardware-unfriendly nonlinear functions in
the SSM block. To address these issues, this paper presents FastMamba, a
dedicated accelerator on FPGA with hardware-algorithm co-design to promote the
deployment efficiency of Mamba2. Specifically, we successfully achieve 8-bit
quantization for linear layers through Hadamard transformation to eliminate
outliers. Moreover, a hardware-friendly and fine-grained power-of-two
quantization framework is presented for the SSM block and convolution layer,
and a first-order linear approximation is developed to optimize the nonlinear
functions. Based on the accurate algorithm quantization, we propose an
accelerator that integrates parallel vector processing units, pipelined
execution dataflow, and an efficient SSM Nonlinear Approximation Unit, which
enhances computational efficiency and reduces hardware complexity. Finally, we
evaluate FastMamba on Xilinx VC709 FPGA. For the input prefill task on
Mamba2-130M, FastMamba achieves 68.80\times and 8.90\times speedup over Intel
Xeon 4210R CPU and NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, respectively. In the output decode
experiment with Mamba2-2.7B, FastMamba attains 6\times higher energy efficiency

Conclusion: SRDiffusion为视频生成提供了一种正交于现有加速策略的实用方案。

Abstract: Leveraging the diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, models like Sora,
CogVideoX and Wan have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video,
image-to-video, and video editing tasks. Despite these advances,
diffusion-based video generation remains computationally intensive, especially
for high-resolution, long-duration videos. Prior work accelerates its inference
by skipping computation, usually at the cost of severe quality degradation. In
this paper, we propose SRDiffusion, a novel framework that leverages
collaboration between large and small models to reduce inference cost. The
large model handles high-noise steps to ensure semantic and motion fidelity
(Sketching), while the smaller model refines visual details in low-noise steps
(Rendering). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches, over 3$\times$ speedup for Wan with nearly no quality loss
for VBench, and 2$\times$ speedup for CogVideoX. Our method is introduced as a
new direction orthogonal to existing acceleration strategies, offering a
practical solution for scalable video generation.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to software development

important. We introduce StructEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
LLMs' capabilities in producing both non-renderable (JSON, YAML, CSV) and
renderable (HTML, React, SVG) structured formats. Unlike prior benchmarks,
StructEval systematically evaluates structural fidelity across diverse formats
through two paradigms: 1) generation tasks, producing structured output from
natural language prompts, and 2) conversion tasks, translating between
structured formats. Our benchmark encompasses 18 formats and 44 types of task,
with novel metrics for format adherence and structural correctness. Results
reveal significant performance gaps, even state-of-the-art models like o1-mini
achieve only 75.58 average score, with open-source alternatives lagging
approximately 10 points behind. We find generation tasks more challenging than
conversion tasks, and producing correct visual content more difficult than

Motivation: 解决ALLMs在适应音频任务时出现的灾难性遗忘和音频幻觉问题，以及减少对资源密集型指令调优数据的依赖。

Method: 利用骨干LLMs合成通用字幕式对齐数据（BALSa），并引入LISTEN对比训练方法，扩展至多音频场景。

Result: 实验表明，BALSa有效减少音频幻觉，保持音频理解和推理能力，多音频训练进一步提升模型性能。

Conclusion: BALSa为ALLMs开发提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in
understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted
from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on
audio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major
limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
important textual capabilities such as instruction-following are lost after
training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that
are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about their reliability.
Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically
relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for
instruction tuning, making the process resource-intensive. To address these
issues, we leverage the backbone LLMs from ALLMs to synthesize general-purpose
caption-style alignment data. We refer to this process as bootstrapping
audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs
(BALSa). Building on BALSa, we introduce LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds
Through Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method designed
to improve ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds. We
further extend BALSa to multi-audio scenarios, where the model either explains
the differences between audio inputs or produces a unified caption that
describes them all, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. Experimental
results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations
while reliably maintaining strong performance in audio understanding,
reasoning, and instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating
multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning
capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to the
development of ALLMs.

Result: 元攻击者在单轮攻击中达到73%的成功率，防御者最终将其成功率降至7%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了LLMs在开放环境中的安全性。

Abstract: LLMs have made impressive progress, but their growing capabilities also
expose them to highly flexible jailbreaking attacks designed to bypass safety
alignment. While many existing defenses focus on known types of attacks, it is
more critical to prepare LLMs for unseen attacks that may arise during
deployment. To address this, we propose a lifelong safety alignment framework
that enables LLMs to continuously adapt to new and evolving jailbreaking
strategies. Our framework introduces a competitive setup between two
components: a Meta-Attacker, trained to actively discover novel jailbreaking
strategies, and a Defender, trained to resist them. To effectively warm up the
Meta-Attacker, we first leverage the GPT-4o API to extract key insights from a
large collection of jailbreak-related research papers. Through iterative
training, the first iteration Meta-Attacker achieves a 73% attack success rate
(ASR) on RR and a 57% transfer ASR on LAT using only single-turn attacks.
Meanwhile, the Defender progressively improves its robustness and ultimately
reduces the Meta-Attacker's success rate to just 7%, enabling safer and more
reliable deployment of LLMs in open-ended environments. The code is available

Result: 当前LLM在VADER上的准确率在49-54%之间，修复质量与分类和测试计划准确性高度相关。

Conclusion: VADER为社区提供了一个可解释、可复现的基准测试，推动漏洞感知LLM的发展。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) can effectively assess, detect,
explain, and remediate software vulnerabilities is critical for building robust
and secure software systems. We introduce VADER, a human-evaluated benchmark
designed explicitly to assess LLM performance across four key
vulnerability-handling dimensions: assessment, detection, explanation, and
remediation. VADER comprises 174 real-world software vulnerabilities, each
carefully curated from GitHub repositories and annotated by security experts.
For each vulnerability case, models are tasked with identifying the flaw,
classifying it using Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), explaining its
underlying cause, proposing a patch, and formulating a test plan. Using a
one-shot prompting strategy, we benchmark six state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, Grok 3 Beta, and o3) on VADER, and
human security experts evaluated each response according to a rigorous scoring
rubric emphasizing remediation (quality of the code fix, 50%), explanation
(20%), and classification and test plan (30%) according to a standardized
rubric. Our results show that current state-of-the-art LLMs achieve only
moderate success on VADER - OpenAI's o3 attained 54.7% accuracy overall, with
others in the 49-54% range, indicating ample room for improvement. Notably,
remediation quality is strongly correlated (Pearson r > 0.97) with accurate
classification and test plans, suggesting that models that effectively
categorize vulnerabilities also tend to fix them well. VADER's comprehensive
dataset, detailed evaluation rubrics, scoring tools, and visualized results
with confidence intervals are publicly released, providing the community with
an interpretable, reproducible benchmark to advance vulnerability-aware LLMs.

Result: CODE-DITING 1.5B在相同参数规模下表现最佳，7B版本甚至超越GPT-4o和DeepSeek-V3 671B，仅使用其1%的参数。

Conclusion: CODE-DITING在准确性、效率和可解释性上取得平衡，是代码评估的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Trustworthy evaluation methods for code snippets play a crucial role in
neural code generation. Traditional methods, which either rely on reference
solutions or require executable test cases, have inherent limitation in
flexibility and scalability. The recent LLM-as-Judge methodology offers a
promising alternative by directly evaluating functional consistency between the
problem description and the generated code. To systematically understand the
landscape of these LLM-as-Judge methods, we conduct a comprehensive empirical
study across three diverse datasets. Our investigation reveals the pros and
cons of two categories of LLM-as-Judge methods: the methods based on general
foundation models can achieve good performance but require complex prompts and
lack explainability, while the methods based on reasoning foundation models
provide better explainability with simpler prompts but demand substantial
computational resources due to their large parameter sizes. To address these
limitations, we propose CODE-DITING, a novel code evaluation method that
balances accuracy, efficiency and explainability. We develop a data
distillation framework that effectively transfers reasoning capabilities from
DeepSeek-R1671B to our CODE-DITING 1.5B and 7B models, significantly enhancing
evaluation explainability and reducing the computational cost. With the
majority vote strategy in the inference process, CODE-DITING 1.5B outperforms
all models with the same magnitude of parameters and achieves performance which
would normally exhibit in a model with 5 times of parameter scale. CODE-DITING
7B surpasses GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 671B, even though it only uses 1% of the
parameter volume of these large models. Further experiments show that
CODEDITING is robust to preference leakage and can serve as a promising
alternative for code evaluation.

Abstract: Various industries have produced a large number of documents such as

complex and content-wise fragmented. This poses significant challenges for
experts and decision-makers in terms of retrieval and understanding. Although
existing LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods can provide
context-related suggestions, they lack quantitative weighting and traceable
reasoning paths, making it difficult to offer multi-level and transparent
decision support. To address this issue, this paper proposes the RAD method,
which integrates Multi-Criteria Decision Making with the semantic understanding
capabilities of LLMs. The method automatically extracts key criteria from
industry documents, builds a weighted hierarchical decision model, and
generates structured reports under model guidance. The RAD framework introduces
explicit weight assignment and reasoning chains in decision generation to
ensure accuracy, completeness, and traceability. Experiments show that in
various decision-making tasks, the decision reports generated by RAD
significantly outperform existing methods in terms of detail, rationality, and
structure, demonstrating its application value and potential in complex

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning lies at the heart of artificial intelligence,
underpinning applications in education, program verification, and
research-level mathematical discovery. Mathematical competitions, in
particular, present two challenging problem types: theorem-proving, requiring
rigorous proofs of stated conclusions, and answer-construction, involving
hypothesizing and formally verifying mathematical objects. Large Language
Models (LLMs) effectively generate creative candidate answers but struggle with
formal verification, while symbolic provers ensure rigor but cannot efficiently

Enumerate-Conjecture-Prove (ECP) framework, a modular neuro-symbolic method
integrating LLM-based enumeration and pattern-driven conjecturing with formal
theorem proving. We present ConstructiveBench, a dataset of 3,431

answer construction from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline of 14.54% to

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
document understanding. However, the information-dense nature of document
images still poses challenges, as most queries depend on only a few relevant
regions, with the rest being redundant. Existing one-pass MLLMs process entire
document images without considering query relevance, often failing to focus on
critical regions and producing unfaithful responses. Inspired by the human
coarse-to-fine reading pattern, we introduce Doc-CoB (Chain-of-Box), a
simple-yet-effective mechanism that integrates human-style visual reasoning
into MLLM without modifying its architecture. Our method allows the model to
autonomously select the set of regions (boxes) most relevant to the query, and
then focus attention on them for further understanding. We first design a fully
automatic pipeline, integrating a commercial MLLM with a layout analyzer, to
generate 249k training samples with intermediate visual reasoning supervision.
Then we incorporate two enabling tasks that improve box identification and
box-query reasoning, which together enhance document understanding. Extensive
experiments on seven benchmarks with four popular models show that Doc-CoB
significantly improves performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and wide
applicability. All code, data, and models will be released publicly.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promising results in integrating diverse modalities such as texts and images.
MLLMs are heavily influenced by modality bias, often relying on language while
under-utilizing other modalities like visual inputs. This position paper argues
that MLLMs are deeply affected by modality bias. Firstly, we diagnose the
current state of modality bias, highlighting its manifestations across various
tasks. Secondly, we propose a systematic research road-map related to modality
bias in MLLMs. Thirdly, we identify key factors of modality bias in MLLMs and
offer actionable suggestions for future research to mitigate it. To
substantiate these findings, we conduct experiments that demonstrate the
influence of each factor: 1. Data Characteristics: Language data is compact and
abstract, while visual data is redundant and complex, creating an inherent
imbalance in learning dynamics. 2. Imbalanced Backbone Capabilities: The
dominance of pretrained language models in MLLMs leads to overreliance on
language and neglect of visual information. 3. Training Objectives: Current
objectives often fail to promote balanced cross-modal alignment, resulting in
shortcut learning biased toward language. These findings highlight the need for
balanced training strategies and model architectures to better integrate
multiple modalities in MLLMs. We call for interdisciplinary efforts to tackle
these challenges and drive innovation in MLLM research. Our work provides a
fresh perspective on modality bias in MLLMs and offers insights for developing
more robust and generalizable multimodal systems-advancing progress toward
Artificial General Intelligence.

Abstract: Role-based access control (RBAC) and hierarchical structures are foundational
to how information flows and decisions are made within virtually all
organizations. As the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as
unified knowledge repositories and intelligent assistants in enterprise
settings becomes increasingly apparent, a critical, yet under explored,
challenge emerges: \textit{can these models reliably understand and operate
within the complex, often nuanced, constraints imposed by organizational
hierarchies and associated permissions?} Evaluating this crucial capability is
inherently difficult due to the proprietary and sensitive nature of real-world
corporate data and access control policies. We introduce a synthetic yet
representative \textbf{OrgAccess} benchmark consisting of 40 distinct types of
permissions commonly relevant across different organizational roles and levels.
We further create three types of permissions: 40,000 easy (1 permission),
10,000 medium (3-permissions tuple), and 20,000 hard (5-permissions tuple) to
test LLMs' ability to accurately assess these permissions and generate
responses that strictly adhere to the specified hierarchical rules,
particularly in scenarios involving users with overlapping or conflicting
permissions. Our findings reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle
significantly to maintain compliance with role-based structures, even with
explicit instructions, with their performance degrades further when navigating
interactions involving two or more conflicting permissions. Specifically, even
\textbf{GPT-4.1 only achieves an F1-Score of 0.27 on our hardest benchmark}.
This demonstrates a critical limitation in LLMs' complex rule following and
compositional reasoning capabilities beyond standard factual or STEM-based
benchmarks, opening up a new paradigm for evaluating their fitness for
practical, structured environments.

Abstract: Effective teaching requires adapting instructional strategies to accommodate
the diverse cognitive and behavioral profiles of students, a persistent
challenge in education and teacher training. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise as tools to simulate such complex pedagogical environments,
current simulation frameworks are limited in two key respects: (1) they often
reduce students to static knowledge profiles, and (2) they lack adaptive
mechanisms for modeling teachers who evolve their strategies in response to
student feedback. To address these gaps, \textbf{we introduce a novel
simulation framework that integrates LLM-based heterogeneous student agents
with a self-optimizing teacher agent}. The teacher agent's pedagogical policy
is dynamically evolved using a genetic algorithm, allowing it to discover and
refine effective teaching strategies based on the aggregate performance of
diverse learners. In addition, \textbf{we propose Persona-RAG}, a Retrieval
Augmented Generation module that enables student agents to retrieve knowledge
tailored to their individual learning styles. Persona-RAG preserves the
retrieval accuracy of standard RAG baselines while enhancing personalization,
an essential factor in modeling realistic educational scenarios. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate how our framework supports the emergence
of distinct and interpretable teaching patterns when interacting with varied
student populations. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-driven
simulations to inform adaptive teaching practices and provide a testbed for
training human educators in controlled, data-driven environments.

Conclusion: 课程驱动的RL方法有望推动医学多模态语言模型的稳健性和临床相关性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning with verifiable, rule-based rewards
have greatly enhanced the reasoning capabilities and out-of-distribution
generalization of VLMs/LLMs, obviating the need for manually crafted reasoning
chains. Despite these promising developments in the general domain, their
translation to medical imaging remains limited. Current medical reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT) methods predominantly focus on close-ended VQA, thereby
restricting the model's ability to engage in world knowledge retrieval and
flexible task adaptation. More critically, these methods fall short of
addressing the critical clinical demand for open-ended, reasoning-intensive
decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MedCCO}, the first
multimodal reinforcement learning framework tailored for medical VQA that
unifies close-ended and open-ended data within a curriculum-driven RFT
paradigm. Specifically, MedCCO is initially fine-tuned on a diverse set of
close-ended medical VQA tasks to establish domain-grounded reasoning
capabilities, and is then progressively adapted to open-ended tasks to foster
deeper knowledge enhancement and clinical interpretability. We validate MedCCO
across eight challenging medical VQA benchmarks, spanning both close-ended and
open-ended settings. Experimental results show that MedCCO consistently
enhances performance and generalization, achieving a 11.4\% accuracy gain
across three in-domain tasks, and a 5.7\% improvement on five out-of-domain
benchmarks. These findings highlight the promise of curriculum-guided RL in
advancing robust, clinically-relevant reasoning in medical multimodal language
models.

Result: LLM评分效率高，但会引入类似人类评分者的CIV，其贡献程度与传统ML不同。ML评分最严格，LLM最宽松。

Conclusion: LLM在自动评分中具有潜力，但需注意其引入的CIV，未来研究应关注模型可解释性和评分设计。

Abstract: Assessing teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) through
performance-based tasks is both time and effort-consuming. While large language
models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for efficient automatic scoring, little
is known about whether LLMs introduce construct-irrelevant variance (CIV) in
ways similar to or different from traditional machine learning (ML) and human
raters. This study examines three sources of CIV -- scenario variability, rater
severity, and rater sensitivity to scenario -- in the context of video-based
constructed-response tasks targeting two PCK sub-constructs: analyzing student
thinking and evaluating teacher responsiveness. Using generalized linear mixed
models (GLMMs), we compared variance components and rater-level scoring
patterns across three scoring sources: human raters, supervised ML, and LLM.
Results indicate that scenario-level variance was minimal across tasks, while
rater-related factors contributed substantially to CIV, especially in the more
interpretive Task II. The ML model was the most severe and least sensitive
rater, whereas the LLM was the most lenient. These findings suggest that the
LLM contributes to scoring efficiency while also introducing CIV as human
raters do, yet with varying levels of contribution compared to supervised ML.
Implications for rater training, automated scoring design, and future research
on model interpretability are discussed.

Conclusion: 因果驱动的解缠框架有效解决了MLLMs中的物体幻觉问题，为多模态模型的鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
in visual understanding tasks, yet they often suffer from object
hallucinations--generating descriptions of objects that are inconsistent with
or entirely absent from the input. This issue is closely related to dataset
biases, where frequent co-occurrences of objects lead to entangled semantic
representations across modalities. As a result, models may erroneously activate
object representations that are commonly associated with the input but not
actually present.
  To address this, we propose a causality-driven disentanglement framework that
mitigates hallucinations through causal intervention. Our approach includes a
Causal-Driven Projector in the visual pathway and a Causal Intervention Module
integrated into the final transformer layer of the language model. These
components work together to reduce spurious correlations caused by biased
training data.
  Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces
hallucinations while maintaining strong performance on multiple multimodal
benchmarks. Visualization analyses further confirm improved separability of
object representations.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to
enhance the capabilities of language models by integrating external knowledge.
Due to the diversity of data sources and the constraints of memory and
computing resources, real-world data is often scattered in multiple devices.
Conventional RAGs that store massive amounts of scattered data centrally face
increasing privacy concerns and high computational costs. Additionally, RAG in
a central node raises latency issues when searching over a large-scale
knowledge base. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed Knowledge
Graph-based RAG approach, referred to as DGRAG, in an edge-cloud system, where
each edge device maintains a local knowledge base without the need to share it
with the cloud, instead sharing only summaries of its knowledge. Specifically,
DGRAG has two main phases. In the Distributed Knowledge Construction phase,
DGRAG organizes local knowledge using knowledge graphs, generating subgraph
summaries and storing them in a summary database in the cloud as information
sharing. In the Collaborative Retrieval and Generation phase, DGRAG first
performs knowledge retrieval and answer generation locally, and a gate
mechanism determines whether the query is beyond the scope of local knowledge
or processing capabilities. For queries that exceed the local knowledge scope,
the cloud retrieves knowledge from the most relevant edges based on the
summaries and generates a more precise answer. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed DGRAG approach in significantly improving the
quality of question-answering tasks over baseline approaches.

TL;DR: EMAC+ integrates LLM and VLM for robotics control, addressing limitations like static planning and lack of visual learning, achieving superior performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with robotics control due to text-centric design, static planning, and inability to learn from visual interactions. EMAC+ aims to overcome these by integrating LLM and VLM dynamically.

Method: EMAC+ uses a bidirectional training paradigm to refine LLM-generated plans with real-time VLM feedback, enabling LLM to internalize visual dynamics.

Result: EMAC+ outperforms on ALFWorld and RT-1 benchmarks, showing robustness and efficient learning.

Conclusion: EMAC+ successfully bridges LLMs and VLMs for embodied tasks, improving performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Although LLMs demonstrate proficiency in several text-based reasoning and
planning tasks, their implementation in robotics control is constrained by
significant deficiencies: (1) LLM agents are designed to work mainly with
textual inputs rather than visual conditions; (2) Current multimodal agents
treat LLMs as static planners, which separates their reasoning from environment
dynamics, resulting in actions that do not take domain-specific knowledge into
account; and (3) LLMs are not designed to learn from visual interactions, which
makes it harder for them to make better policies for specific domains. In this
paper, we introduce EMAC+, an Embodied Multimodal Agent that collaboratively
integrates LLM and VLM via a bidirectional training paradigm. Unlike existing
methods, EMAC+ dynamically refines high-level textual plans generated by an LLM
using real-time feedback from a VLM executing low-level visual control tasks.
We address critical limitations of previous models by enabling the LLM to
internalize visual environment dynamics directly through interactive
experience, rather than relying solely on static symbolic mappings. Extensive
experimental evaluations on ALFWorld and RT-1 benchmarks demonstrate that EMAC+
achieves superior task performance, robustness against noisy observations, and
efficient learning. We also conduct thorough ablation studies and provide
detailed analyses of success and failure cases.

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效检索演示，显著提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，尤其是在小型LLMs上。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, which translates a natural language question into an SQL query,
has advanced with in-context learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
existing methods show little improvement in performance compared to randomly
chosen demonstrations, and significant performance drops when smaller LLMs
(e.g., Llama 3.1-8B) are used. This indicates that these methods heavily rely
on the intrinsic capabilities of hyper-scaled LLMs, rather than effectively
retrieving useful demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
for effectively retrieving demonstrations and generating SQL queries. We
construct a Deep Contextual Schema Link Graph, which contains key information
and semantic relationship between a question and its database schema items.
This graph-based structure enables effective representation of Text-to-SQL
samples and retrieval of useful demonstrations for in-context learning.
Experimental results on the Spider benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showing consistent improvements in SQL generation performance and
efficiency across both hyper-scaled LLMs and small LLMs. Our code will be
released.

Method: 构建了一个包含5,000个样本的分层提示数据集，由50名人类参与者标注，逐步增加复杂性，对比System I和System II的表现。

Result: 慢速推理模型倾向于深度优先思考，容易因错误前提生成虚假细节；快速推理模型则采用广度优先推理，更谨慎。

Conclusion: 慢速推理模型在结构化任务中高效，但在多模态模糊输入下脆弱。

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently attracted significant attention, especially
for tasks that involve complex inference. Their strengths exemplify the System
II paradigm (slow, structured thinking), contrasting with the System I (rapid,
heuristic-driven). Yet, does slower reasoning necessarily lead to greater
truthfulness? Our findings suggest otherwise. In this study, we present the
first systematic investigation of distortions associated with System I and
System II reasoning in multimodal contexts. We demonstrate that slower
reasoning models, when presented with incomplete or misleading visual inputs,
are more likely to fabricate plausible yet false details to support flawed
reasoning -- a phenomenon we term the "Mirage of Multimodality". To examine
this, we constructed a 5,000-sample hierarchical prompt dataset annotated by 50
human participants. These prompts gradually increase in complexity, revealing a
consistent pattern: slower reasoning models tend to employ depth-first thinking
(delving deeper into incorrect premises), whereas faster chat models favor
breadth-first inference, exhibiting greater caution under uncertainty. Our
results highlight a critical vulnerability of slower reasoning models: although
highly effective in structured domains such as mathematics, it becomes brittle
when confronted with ambiguous multimodal inputs.

Result: 在多个RAG基准测试中，syftr发现的配置平均便宜9倍，同时保持Pareto前沿的高准确性。

Conclusion: syftr能高效设计和优化RAG流程，支持新模块集成，提升生成式AI管道的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines are central to applying large
language models (LLMs) to proprietary or dynamic data. However, building
effective RAG flows is complex, requiring careful selection among vector
databases, embedding models, text splitters, retrievers, and synthesizing LLMs.
The challenge deepens with the rise of agentic paradigms. Modules like
verifiers, rewriters, and rerankers-each with intricate hyperparameter
dependencies have to be carefully tuned. Balancing tradeoffs between latency,
accuracy, and cost becomes increasingly difficult in performance-sensitive
applications.
  We introduce syftr, a framework that performs efficient multi-objective
search over a broad space of agentic and non-agentic RAG configurations. Using
Bayesian Optimization, syftr discovers Pareto-optimal flows that jointly
optimize task accuracy and cost. A novel early-stopping mechanism further
improves efficiency by pruning clearly suboptimal candidates. Across multiple
RAG benchmarks, syftr finds flows which are on average approximately 9 times
cheaper while preserving most of the accuracy of the most accurate flows on the
Pareto-frontier. Furthermore, syftr's ability to design and optimize allows
integrating new modules, making it even easier and faster to realize
high-performing generative AI pipelines.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) decompose complex tasks and delegate subtasks to
different large language model (LLM) agents and tools. Prior studies have
reported the superior accuracy performance of MAS across diverse domains,
enabled by long-horizon context tracking and error correction through
role-specific agents. However, the design and deployment of MAS incur higher
complexity and runtime cost compared to single-agent systems (SAS). Meanwhile,
frontier LLMs, such as OpenAI-o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, have rapidly advanced in
long-context reasoning, memory retention, and tool usage, mitigating many
limitations that originally motivated MAS designs. In this paper, we conduct an
extensive empirical study comparing MAS and SAS across various popular agentic
applications. We find that the benefits of MAS over SAS diminish as LLM
capabilities improve, and we propose efficient mechanisms to pinpoint the
error-prone agent in MAS. Furthermore, the performance discrepancy between MAS
and SAS motivates our design of a hybrid agentic paradigm, request cascading
between MAS and SAS, to improve both efficiency and capability. Our design
improves accuracy by 1.1-12% while reducing deployment costs by up to 20%
across various agentic applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) exhibit
remarkable problem-solving and task planning capabilities across diverse
domains due to their specialized agentic roles and collaborative interactions.
However, this also amplifies the severity of security risks under MAS attacks.
To address this, we introduce MASTER, a novel security research framework for
MAS, focusing on diverse Role configurations and Topological structures across
various scenarios. MASTER offers an automated construction process for
different MAS setups and an information-flow-based interaction paradigm. To
tackle MAS security challenges in varied scenarios, we design a
scenario-adaptive, extensible attack strategy utilizing role and topological
information, which dynamically allocates targeted, domain-specific attack tasks
for collaborative agent execution. Our experiments demonstrate that such an
attack, leveraging role and topological information, exhibits significant
destructive potential across most models. Additionally, we propose
corresponding defense strategies, substantially enhancing MAS resilience across
diverse scenarios. We anticipate that our framework and findings will provide
valuable insights for future research into MAS security challenges.

Method: 扩展LiRA攻击方法至GPT-2架构（参数规模从10M到1B），在C4数据集上训练参考模型（超过20B tokens）。

Result: 强MIAs在LLMs上可行但效果有限（AUC<0.7），且MIA成功与隐私指标关系复杂。

Conclusion: MIAs在LLMs上可行但效果有限，需进一步研究攻击设计与隐私指标的关系。

Abstract: State-of-the-art membership inference attacks (MIAs) typically require
training many reference models, making it difficult to scale these attacks to
large pre-trained language models (LLMs). As a result, prior research has
either relied on weaker attacks that avoid training reference models (e.g.,
fine-tuning attacks), or on stronger attacks applied to small-scale models and
datasets. However, weaker attacks have been shown to be brittle - achieving
close-to-arbitrary success - and insights from strong attacks in simplified
settings do not translate to today's LLMs. These challenges have prompted an
important question: are the limitations observed in prior work due to attack
design choices, or are MIAs fundamentally ineffective on LLMs? We address this
question by scaling LiRA - one of the strongest MIAs - to GPT-2 architectures
ranging from 10M to 1B parameters, training reference models on over 20B tokens
from the C4 dataset. Our results advance the understanding of MIAs on LLMs in
three key ways: (1) strong MIAs can succeed on pre-trained LLMs; (2) their
effectiveness, however, remains limited (e.g., AUC<0.7) in practical settings;
and, (3) the relationship between MIA success and related privacy metrics is
not as straightforward as prior work has suggested.

Abstract: Conventional AI evaluation approaches concentrated within the AI stack
exhibit systemic limitations for exploring, navigating and resolving the human
and societal factors that play out in real world deployment such as in
education, finance, healthcare, and employment sectors. AI capability
evaluations can capture detail about first-order effects, such as whether
immediate system outputs are accurate, or contain toxic, biased or
stereotypical content, but AI's second-order effects, i.e. any long-term
outcomes and consequences that may result from AI use in the real world, have
become a significant area of interest as the technology becomes embedded in our
daily lives. These secondary effects can include shifts in user behavior,
societal, cultural and economic ramifications, workforce transformations, and
long-term downstream impacts that may result from a broad and growing set of
risks. This position paper argues that measuring the indirect and secondary
effects of AI will require expansion beyond static, single-turn approaches
conducted in silico to include testing paradigms that can capture what actually
materializes when people use AI technology in context. Specifically, we
describe the need for data and methods that can facilitate contextual awareness
and enable downstream interpretation and decision making about AI's secondary
effects, and recommend requirements for a new ecosystem.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic recommender systems powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs) represents a paradigm shift in personalized recommendations, leveraging
LLMs' advanced reasoning and role-playing capabilities to enable autonomous,
adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional recommendation approaches, agentic
recommender systems can dynamically gather and interpret user-item interactions
from complex environments, generating robust recommendation strategies that
generalize across diverse scenarios. However, the field currently lacks
standardized evaluation protocols to systematically assess these methods. To
address this critical gap, we propose: (1) an interactive textual
recommendation simulator incorporating rich user and item metadata and three
typical evaluation scenarios (classic, evolving-interest, and cold-start
recommendation tasks); (2) a unified modular framework for developing and
studying agentic recommender systems; and (3) the first comprehensive benchmark
comparing 10 classical and agentic recommendation methods. Our findings
demonstrate the superiority of agentic systems and establish actionable design
guidelines for their core components. The benchmark environment has been
rigorously validated through an open challenge and remains publicly available
with a continuously maintained
leaderboard~\footnote[2]{https://tsinghua-fib-lab.github.io/AgentSocietyChallenge/pages/overview.html},

theoretical framework based on four dimensions: Reasoning Depth, Pattern
Recognition, Noise Filtering, and Context Integration, explaining these
variations. Our analysis identifies five error patterns: predicate
misinterpretation, structural mapping errors, control flow misinterpretation,
arithmetic transformation errors, and constant propagation errors, revealing
fundamental limitations in LLM code processing.We establish a three-tier
resistance model: bogus control flow (low resistance), control flow flattening
(moderate resistance), and instruction substitution/combined techniques (high
resistance). Universal failure against combined techniques demonstrates that
sophisticated obfuscation remains effective against advanced LLMs. Our findings
suggest a human-AI collaboration paradigm where LLMs reduce expertise barriers

Abstract: Transformer-based language models, though not explicitly trained to mimic
brain recordings, have demonstrated surprising alignment with brain activity.
Progress in these models-through increased size, instruction-tuning, and
multimodality-has led to better representational alignment with neural data.
Recently, a new class of instruction-tuned multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have
emerged, showing remarkable zero-shot capabilities in open-ended multimodal
vision tasks. However, it is unknown whether MLLMs, when prompted with natural
instructions, lead to better brain alignment and effectively capture
instruction-specific representations. To address this, we first investigate
brain alignment, i.e., measuring the degree of predictivity of neural visual
activity using text output response embeddings from MLLMs as participants
engage in watching natural scenes. Experiments with 10 different instructions
show that MLLMs exhibit significantly better brain alignment than vision-only
models and perform comparably to non-instruction-tuned multimodal models like
CLIP. We also find that while these MLLMs are effective at generating
high-quality responses suitable to the task-specific instructions, not all
instructions are relevant for brain alignment. Further, by varying
instructions, we make the MLLMs encode instruction-specific visual concepts
related to the input image. This analysis shows that MLLMs effectively capture
count-related and recognition-related concepts, demonstrating strong alignment
with brain activity. Notably, the majority of the explained variance of the
brain encoding models is shared between MLLM embeddings of image captioning and
other instructions. These results suggest that enhancing MLLMs' ability to
capture task-specific information could lead to better differentiation between
various types of instructions, and thereby improving their precision in
predicting brain responses.

the HumanEval benchmark. To simulate the code review task objectively, we
expected LLMs to assess code correctness and improve the code if needed. We ran

With problem descriptions, GPT4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash correctly classified code
correctness 68.50% and 63.89% of the time, respectively, and corrected the code
67.83% and 54.26% of the time for the 492 code blocks of varying correctness.
Without problem descriptions, performance declined. The results for the 164

correctness, but there is a risk of faulty outputs. We propose a process that

content that is irrelevant or inconsistent with a character's background. We
attribute these failures to: (1) the inability to accurately recall
character-specific knowledge due to entity ambiguity, and (2) a lack of
awareness of the character's cognitive boundaries. To address these issues, we
propose RoleRAG, a retrieval-based framework that integrates efficient entity
disambiguation for knowledge indexing with a boundary-aware retriever for
extracting contextually appropriate information from a structured knowledge
graph. Experiments on role-playing benchmarks show that RoleRAG's calibrated
retrieval helps both general-purpose and role-specific LLMs better align with
character knowledge and reduce hallucinated responses.

Motivation: 理解神经网络在算法推理中的学习机制，尤其是为何某些算法能有效学习而其他算法失败，以推动神经网络在复杂算法学习中的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用神经编译技术，将源算法直接编码到神经网络参数中，绕过传统训练，对比编译与学习参数的行为差异，并以GNNs为研究对象。

Result: 发现GNNs在算法学习中存在表达性与可训练性之间的差距，假设归纳学习对并行算法（如NC类）最有效。

Conclusion: 神经编译为算法学习提供了新视角，揭示了GNNs的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper aims to understand how neural networks learn algorithmic reasoning
by addressing two questions: How faithful are learned algorithms when they are
effective, and why do neural networks fail to learn effective algorithms
otherwise? To answer these questions, we use neural compilation, a technique
that directly encodes a source algorithm into neural network parameters,
enabling the network to compute the algorithm exactly. This enables comparison
between compiled and conventionally learned parameters, intermediate vectors,
and behaviors. This investigation is crucial for developing neural networks
that robustly learn complexalgorithms from data. Our analysis focuses on graph
neural networks (GNNs), which are naturally aligned with algorithmic reasoning
tasks, specifically our choices of BFS, DFS, and Bellman-Ford, which cover the
spectrum of effective, faithful, and ineffective learned algorithms. Commonly,
learning algorithmic reasoning is framed as induction over synthetic data,
where a parameterized model is trained on inputs, traces, and outputs produced
by an underlying ground truth algorithm. In contrast, we introduce a neural
compilation method for GNNs, which sets network parameters analytically,
bypassing training. Focusing on GNNs leverages their alignment with algorithmic
reasoning, extensive algorithmic induction literature, and the novel
application of neural compilation to GNNs. Overall, this paper aims to
characterize expressability-trainability gaps - a fundamental shortcoming in
learning algorithmic reasoning. We hypothesize that inductive learning is most
effective for parallel algorithms contained within the computational class
\texttt{NC}.

Motivation: 探索如何最有效地将心电图（ECG）输入到大型语言模型（LLMs）中，以提升心电图语言模型（ELMs）的性能。

Method: 在6个公共数据集和5个评估指标上，对三种ECG输入表示形式（原始信号、图像、符号序列）进行了全面基准测试，并分析了LLM主干、ECG持续时间和标记预算的影响。

Result: 符号表示在统计显著性上优于其他两种输入形式。

Conclusion: 符号序列是开发下一代ELMs的最佳输入表示形式。

Abstract: Recent advances have increasingly applied large language models (LLMs) to
electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation, giving rise to
Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs). Conditioned on an ECG and a textual
query, an ELM autoregressively generates a free-form textual response. Unlike
traditional classification-based systems, ELMs emulate expert cardiac
electrophysiologists by issuing diagnoses, analyzing waveform morphology,
identifying contributing factors, and proposing patient-specific action plans.
To realize this potential, researchers are curating instruction-tuning datasets
that pair ECGs with textual dialogues and are training ELMs on these resources.
Yet before scaling ELMs further, there is a fundamental question yet to be
explored: What is the most effective ECG input representation? In recent works,
three candidate representations have emerged-raw time-series signals, rendered
images, and discretized symbolic sequences. We present the first comprehensive
benchmark of these modalities across 6 public datasets and 5 evaluation
metrics. We find symbolic representations achieve the greatest number of
statistically significant wins over both signal and image inputs. We further
ablate the LLM backbone, ECG duration, and token budget, and we evaluate
robustness to signal perturbations. We hope that our findings offer clear
guidance for selecting input representations when developing the next
generation of ELMs.

Result: 在四个TableQA数据集上，Weaver表现优于现有方法，减少API调用和错误率。

Conclusion: Weaver通过灵活结合SQL和LLM，显著提升了表格问答的性能。

Abstract: Querying tables with unstructured data is challenging due to the presence of
text (or image), either embedded in the table or in external paragraphs, which
traditional SQL struggles to process, especially for tasks requiring semantic
reasoning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding context,
they face limitations with long input sequences. Existing approaches that
combine SQL and LLMs typically rely on rigid, predefined work-flows, limiting
their adaptability to complex queries. To address these issues, we introduce
Weaver , a modular pipeline that dynamically integrates SQL and LLMs for
table-based question answering (TableQA). Weaver generates a flexible,
step-by-step plan that combines SQL for structured data retrieval with LLMs for
semantic processing. By decomposing complex queries into manageable subtasks,
Weaver improves accuracy and generalization. Our experiments show that Weaver
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four TableQA datasets,
reducing both API calls and error rates.

Conclusion: DeCoDe为人类-AI协作提供了实例化、可解释和自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: In human-AI collaboration, a central challenge is deciding whether the AI
should handle a task, be deferred to a human expert, or be addressed through
collaborative effort. Existing Learning to Defer approaches typically make
binary choices between AI and humans, neglecting their complementary strengths.
They also lack interpretability, a critical property in high-stakes scenarios
where users must understand and, if necessary, correct the model's reasoning.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Defer-and-Complement Decision-Making
via Decoupled Concept Bottleneck Models (DeCoDe), a concept-driven framework
for human-AI collaboration. DeCoDe makes strategy decisions based on
human-interpretable concept representations, enhancing transparency throughout
the decision process. It supports three flexible modes: autonomous AI
prediction, deferral to humans, and human-AI collaborative complementarity,
selected via a gating network that takes concept-level inputs and is trained
using a novel surrogate loss that balances accuracy and human effort. This
approach enables instance-specific, interpretable, and adaptive human-AI
collaboration. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DeCoDe
significantly outperforms AI-only, human-only, and traditional deferral
baselines, while maintaining strong robustness and interpretability even under
noisy expert annotations.

Abstract: Self-awareness - the ability to distinguish oneself from the surrounding
environment - underpins intelligent, autonomous behavior. Recent advances in AI
achieve human-like performance in tasks integrating multimodal information,
particularly in large language models, raising interest in the embodiment
capabilities of AI agents on nonhuman platforms such as robots. Here, we
explore whether multimodal LLMs can develop self-awareness solely through
sensorimotor experiences. By integrating a multimodal LLM into an autonomous
mobile robot, we test its ability to achieve this capacity. We find that the
system exhibits robust environmental awareness, self-recognition and predictive
awareness, allowing it to infer its robotic nature and motion characteristics.
Structural equation modeling reveals how sensory integration influences
distinct dimensions of self-awareness and its coordination with past-present
memory, as well as the hierarchical internal associations that drive
self-identification. Ablation tests of sensory inputs identify critical
modalities for each dimension, demonstrate compensatory interactions among
sensors and confirm the essential role of structured and episodic memory in
coherent reasoning. These findings demonstrate that, given appropriate sensory
information about the world and itself, multimodal LLMs exhibit emergent
self-awareness, opening the door to artificial embodied cognitive systems.

Conclusion: EaF方法有助于发现并纠正对努力改善但仍受系统性劣势影响的个体的不公平决策。

Abstract: Although popularized AI fairness metrics, e.g., demographic parity, have
uncovered bias in AI-assisted decision-making outcomes, they do not consider
how much effort one has spent to get to where one is today in the input feature
space. However, the notion of effort is important in how Philosophy and humans
understand fairness. We propose a philosophy-informed way to conceptualize and
evaluate Effort-aware Fairness (EaF) based on the concept of Force, or temporal
trajectory of predictive features coupled with inertia. In addition to our
theoretical formulation of EaF metrics, our empirical contributions include: 1/
a pre-registered human subjects experiment, which demonstrates that for both
stages of the (individual) fairness evaluation process, people consider the
temporal trajectory of a predictive feature more than its aggregate value; 2/
pipelines to compute Effort-aware Individual/Group Fairness in the criminal
justice and personal finance contexts. Our work may enable AI model auditors to
uncover and potentially correct unfair decisions against individuals who spent
significant efforts to improve but are still stuck with systemic/early-life
disadvantages outside their control.

Abstract: With the rise of generative AI (GenAI), Large Language Models are
increasingly employed for code generation, becoming active co-authors alongside
human programmers. Focusing specifically on this application domain, this paper
articulates distinct ``Architectures of Error'' to ground an epistemic
distinction between human and machine code generation. Examined through their
shared vulnerability to error, this distinction reveals fundamentally different
causal origins: human-cognitive versus artificial-stochastic. To develop this
framework and substantiate the distinction, the analysis draws critically upon
Dennett's mechanistic functionalism and Rescher's methodological pragmatism. I
argue that a systematic differentiation of these error profiles raises critical
philosophical questions concerning semantic coherence, security robustness,
epistemic limits, and control mechanisms in human-AI collaborative software
development. The paper also utilizes Floridi's levels of abstraction to provide
a nuanced understanding of how these error dimensions interact and may evolve
with technological advancements. This analysis aims to offer philosophers a
structured framework for understanding GenAI's unique epistemological
challenges, shaped by these architectural foundations, while also providing
software engineers a basis for more critically informed engagement.

Abstract: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) are transforming core
quantitative methods in communication research in particular, and in the social
sciences more broadly-namely, content analysis, survey research, and
experimental studies. Rather than replacing classical approaches, LLMs
introduce new possibilities for coding and interpreting text, simulating
dynamic respondents, and generating personalized and interactive stimuli.
Drawing on recent interdisciplinary work, the paper highlights both the
potential and limitations of LLMs as research tools, including issues of
validity, bias, and interpretability. To situate these developments
theoretically, the paper revisits Lasswell's foundational framework -- "Who
says what, in which channel, to whom, with what effect?" -- and demonstrates
how LLMs reconfigure message studies, audience analysis, and effects research
by enabling interpretive variation, audience trajectory modeling, and
counterfactual experimentation. Revisiting the metaphor of the methodological
compass, the paper argues that classical research logics remain essential as
the field integrates LLMs and generative AI. By treating LLMs not only as
technical instruments but also as epistemic and cultural tools, the paper calls
for thoughtful, rigorous, and imaginative use of LLMs in future communication
and social science research.

large models (VLLMs) to generate high-quality parameters and appearance
descriptions; (2) a Transformer-based CAD generator (TCADGen) that predicts
modeling sequences via dual-channel feature aggregation; (3) an enhanced CAD
modeling generation model, called CADLLM, that is designed to refine the
generated sequences by incorporating the confidence scores from TCADGen.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues
in education. This study examines the use of LLMs in supporting learning in
machine learning education; in particular, it focuses on the ability of LLMs to
identify common errors of practice (pitfalls) in machine learning code, and
their ability to provide feedback that can guide learning. Using a portfolio of
code samples, we consider four different LLMs: one closed model and three open
models. Whilst the most basic pitfalls are readily identified by all models,
many common pitfalls are not. They particularly struggle to identify pitfalls
in the early stages of the ML pipeline, especially those which can lead to
information leaks, a major source of failure within applied ML projects. They
also exhibit limited success at identifying pitfalls around model selection,
which is a concept that students often struggle with when first transitioning
from theory to practice. This questions the use of current LLMs to support
machine learning education, and also raises important questions about their use
by novice practitioners. Nevertheless, when LLMs successfully identify pitfalls
in code, they do provide feedback that includes advice on how to proceed,
emphasising their potential role in guiding learners. We also compare the
capability of closed and open LLM models, and find that the gap is relatively
small given the large difference in model sizes. This presents an opportunity
to deploy, and potentially customise, smaller more efficient LLM models within
education, avoiding risks around cost and data sharing associated with
commercial models.

Abstract: For nearly a decade the academic community has investigated backdoors in
neural networks, primarily focusing on classification tasks where adversaries
manipulate the model prediction. While demonstrably malicious, the immediate
real-world impact of such prediction-altering attacks has remained unclear. In
this paper we introduce a novel and significantly more potent class of
backdoors that builds upon recent advancements in architectural backdoors. We
demonstrate how these backdoors can be specifically engineered to exploit
batched inference, a common technique for hardware utilization, enabling
large-scale user data manipulation and theft. By targeting the batching
process, these architectural backdoors facilitate information leakage between
concurrent user requests and allow attackers to fully control model responses
directed at other users within the same batch. In other words, an attacker who
can change the model architecture can set and steal model inputs and outputs of
other users within the same batch. We show that such attacks are not only
feasible but also alarmingly effective, can be readily injected into prevalent
model architectures, and represent a truly malicious threat to user privacy and
system integrity. Critically, to counteract this new class of vulnerabilities,
we propose a deterministic mitigation strategy that provides formal guarantees
against this new attack vector, unlike prior work that relied on Large Language
Models to find the backdoors. Our mitigation strategy employs a novel
Information Flow Control mechanism that analyzes the model graph and proves
non-interference between different user inputs within the same batch. Using our
mitigation strategy we perform a large scale analysis of models hosted through
Hugging Face and find over 200 models that introduce (unintended) information
leakage between batch entries due to the use of dynamic quantization.

user-generated posts from the r/Anxiety subreddit for both prompting and
fine-tuning. Our approach utilizes a mixed-method evaluation framework
incorporating three main categories of criteria: (i) linguistic quality, (ii)
safety and trustworthiness, and (iii) supportiveness. Results show that
fine-tuning LLMs with naturalistic anxiety-related data enhanced linguistic
quality but increased toxicity and bias, and diminished emotional
responsiveness. While LLMs exhibited limited empathy, GPT was evaluated as more
supportive overall. Our findings highlight the risks of fine-tuning LLMs on
unprocessed social media content without mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: AcuRank是一个自适应重排序框架，通过动态调整计算量和目标，基于文档相关性的不确定性估计，优化检索任务中的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定大小的子集重排序忽视了查询难度和文档分布，导致效率低下。AcuRank旨在通过自适应计算解决这一问题。

Method: 使用贝叶斯TrueSkill模型迭代优化相关性估计，直到达到足够的置信水平，避免对已有高置信度预测的不必要更新。

Result: 在TREC-DL和BEIR基准测试中，AcuRank在准确性和效率之间取得了更好的平衡，且计算扩展性优于固定计算基线。

Conclusion: AcuRank在多样化检索任务和基于LLM的重排序模型中表现出有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Listwise reranking with large language models (LLMs) enhances top-ranked
results in retrieval-based applications. Due to the limit in context size and
high inference cost of long context, reranking is typically performed over a
fixed size of small subsets, with the final ranking aggregated from these
partial results. This fixed computation disregards query difficulty and
document distribution, leading to inefficiencies. We propose AcuRank, an
adaptive reranking framework that dynamically adjusts both the amount and
target of computation based on uncertainty estimates over document relevance.
Using a Bayesian TrueSkill model, we iteratively refine relevance estimates
until reaching sufficient confidence levels, and our explicit modeling of
ranking uncertainty enables principled control over reranking behavior and
avoids unnecessary updates to confident predictions. Results on the TREC-DL and
BEIR benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves a superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-off and scales better with compute than
fixed-computation baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method across diverse retrieval tasks and LLM-based
reranking models.

Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive analysis of two emerging paradigms in
AI-assisted software development: vibe coding and agentic coding. While both
leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy,
architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes
intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational
workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In
contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through
goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks
with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning
conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms,
debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative
workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems
thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in
enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We
further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language
interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we
articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed
for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest
that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm,
but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development
lifecycle.

Motivation: 在动态环境中集成未存在的服务时，传统方法依赖注册表提供API文档，但大型语言模型（LLMs）因输入令牌限制需要更简洁的API描述预处理方法。

Method: 1）分析RAG在端点发现和API描述预处理中的应用；2）提出Discovery Agent以减少输入令牌长度并提升端点检索；3）评估RAG和Discovery Agent的性能。

Result: 实验表明，基于端点的预处理方法优于朴素分块方法，Discovery Agent显著提升了精确率但可能降低召回率。

Conclusion: RAG和Discovery Agent可有效减少令牌数量并优化端点发现，但需进一步研究以提升推理能力。

Abstract: Integrating multiple (sub-)systems is essential to create advanced
Information Systems. Difficulties mainly arise when integrating dynamic
environments, e.g., the integration at design time of not yet existing
services. This has been traditionally addressed using a registry that provides
the API documentation of the endpoints. Large Language Models have shown to be
capable of automatically creating system integrations (e.g., as service
composition) based on this documentation but require concise input due to input
oken limitations, especially regarding comprehensive API descriptions.
Currently, it is unknown how best to preprocess these API descriptions. In the
present work, we (i) analyze the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation for
endpoint discovery and the chunking, i.e., preprocessing, of state-of-practice
OpenAPIs to reduce the input oken length while preserving the most relevant
information. To further reduce the input token length for the composition
prompt and improve endpoint retrieval, we propose (ii) a Discovery Agent that
only receives a summary of the most relevant endpoints nd retrieves
specification details on demand. We evaluate RAG for endpoint discovery using
(iii) a proposed novel service discovery benchmark SOCBench-D representing a
general setting across numerous domains and the real-world RestBench enchmark,
first, for the different chunking possibilities and parameters measuring the
endpoint retrieval accuracy. Then, we assess the Discovery Agent using the same
test data set. The prototype shows how to successfully employ RAG for endpoint
discovery to reduce the token count. Our experiments show that endpoint-based
approaches outperform naive chunking methods for preprocessing. Relying on an
agent significantly improves precision while being prone to decrease recall,
disclosing the need for further reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in
Recommendation Systems (RS) due to their extensive world knowledge and robust
reasoning capabilities. However, a critical challenge lies in enabling LLMs to
effectively comprehend and extract insights from massive user behaviors.
Current approaches that directly leverage LLMs for user interest learning face
limitations in handling long sequential behaviors, effectively extracting
interest, and applying interest in practical scenarios. To address these
issues, we propose a Hierarchical Tree Search-based User Lifelong Behavior
Modeling framework (HiT-LBM). HiT-LBM integrates Chunked User Behavior
Extraction (CUBE) and Hierarchical Tree Search for Interest (HTS) to capture
diverse interests and interest evolution of user. CUBE divides user lifelong
behaviors into multiple chunks and learns the interest and interest evolution
within each chunk in a cascading manner. HTS generates candidate interests
through hierarchical expansion and searches for the optimal interest with
process rating model to ensure information gain for each behavior chunk.
Additionally, we design Temporal-Ware Interest Fusion (TIF) to integrate
interests from multiple behavior chunks, constructing a comprehensive
representation of user lifelong interests. The representation can be embedded
into any recommendation model to enhance performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it surpasses
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验显示，改进的编码在构建逻辑约束时效率提升18%，整体时间提升16%。

Conclusion: 改进的编码在逻辑可解释性任务中更高效，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Providing explanations for the outputs of artificial neural networks (ANNs)
is crucial in many contexts, such as critical systems, data protection laws and
handling adversarial examples. Logic-based methods can offer explanations with
correctness guarantees, but face scalability challenges. Due to these issues,
it is necessary to compare different encodings of ANNs into logical
constraints, which are used in logic-based explainability. This work compares
two encodings of ANNs: one has been used in the literature to provide
explanations, while the other will be adapted for our context of
explainability. Additionally, the second encoding uses fewer variables and
constraints, thus, potentially enhancing efficiency. Experiments showed similar
running times for computing explanations, but the adapted encoding performed up
to 18\% better in building logical constraints and up to 16\% better in overall
time.

Abstract: We present AIOS 1.0, a novel platform designed to advance computer-use agent

approaches primarily focus on building more powerful agent frameworks or

interfaces are structured. AIOS 1.0 addresses this challenge by transforming
computers into contextual environments that language models can natively
comprehend, implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture to
abstract computer states and actions. This approach effectively decouples
interface complexity from decision complexity, enabling agents to reason more
effectively about computing environments. To demonstrate our platform's
effectiveness, we introduce LiteCUA, a lightweight computer-use agent built on
AIOS 1.0 that achieves a 14.66% success rate on the OSWorld benchmark,
outperforming several specialized agent frameworks despite its simple

for language models represents a promising direction for developing more

Abstract: Agentic AI networking (AgentNet) is a novel AI-native networking paradigm
that relies on a large number of specialized AI agents to collaborate and
coordinate for autonomous decision-making, dynamic environmental adaptation,
and complex goal achievement. It has the potential to facilitate real-time
network management alongside capabilities for self-configuration,
self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex networking
environments, laying the foundation for fully autonomous networking systems in
the future. Despite its promise, AgentNet is still in the early stage of
development, and there still lacks an effective networking framework to support
automatic goal discovery and multi-agent self-orchestration and task
assignment. This paper proposes SANNet, a novel semantic-aware agentic AI
networking architecture that can infer the semantic goal of the user and
automatically assign agents associated with different layers of a mobile system
to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that one of the major
challenges in AgentNet is that different agents may have different and even
conflicting objectives when collaborating for certain goals, we introduce a
dynamic weighting-based conflict-resolving mechanism to address this issue. We
prove that SANNet can provide theoretical guarantee in both conflict-resolving
and model generalization performance for multi-agent collaboration in dynamic
environment. We develop a hardware prototype of SANNet based on the open RAN
and 5GS core platform. Our experimental results show that SANNet can
significantly improve the performance of multi-agent networking systems, even
when agents with conflicting objectives are selected to collaborate for the
same goal.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for
travel demand modeling. However, behavioral misalignment between LLMs and
humans presents obstacles for the usage of LLMs, and existing alignment methods
are frequently inefficient or impractical given the constraints of typical
travel demand data. This paper introduces a novel framework for aligning LLMs
with human travel choice behavior, tailored to the current travel demand data
sources. Our framework uses a persona inference and loading process to
condition LLMs with suitable prompts to enhance alignment. The inference step
establishes a set of base personas from empirical data, and a learned persona
loading function driven by behavioral embeddings guides the loading process. We
validate our framework on the Swissmetro mode choice dataset, and the results
show that our proposed approach significantly outperformed baseline choice
models and LLM-based simulation models in predicting both aggregate mode choice
shares and individual choice outcomes. Furthermore, we showcase that our
framework can generate insights on population behavior through interpretable
parameters. Overall, our research offers a more adaptable, interpretable, and
resource-efficient pathway to robust LLM-based travel behavior simulation,
paving the way to integrate LLMs into travel demand modeling practice in the
future.

Abstract: Extracting structured and quantitative insights from unstructured financial
filings is essential in investment research, yet remains time-consuming and

labor-intensive manual processes, limiting scalability and delaying the
research workflow. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable method
for accurately extracting quantitative insights from unstructured financial
documents, leveraging a multi-agent system composed of large language models.
Our proposed multi-agent system consists of two specialized agents: the
\emph{Extraction Agent} and the \emph{Text-to-SQL Agent}. The
\textit{Extraction Agent} automatically identifies key performance indicators
from unstructured financial text, standardizes their formats, and verifies
their accuracy. On the other hand, the \textit{Text-to-SQL Agent} generates
executable SQL statements from natural language queries, allowing users to
access structured data accurately without requiring familiarity with the
database schema. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed system
effectively transforms unstructured text into structured data accurately and
enables precise retrieval of key information. First, we demonstrate that our
system achieves approximately 95\% accuracy in transforming financial filings
into structured data, matching the performance level typically attained by
human annotators. Second, in a human evaluation of the retrieval task -- where
natural language queries are used to search information from structured data --
91\% of the responses were rated as correct by human evaluators. In both
evaluations, our system generalizes well across financial document types,
consistently delivering reliable performance.

user personalization via lightweight mixing. Compared to prior work, our
unified framework offers improved stylistic control without sacrificing code

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence (A.I.) and large language models
like Chat-GPT, a new race for achieving artificial general intelligence (A.G.I)
has started. While many speculate how and when A.I. will achieve A.G.I., there
is no clear agreement on how A.G.I. can be detected in A.I. models, even when
popular tools like the Turing test (and its modern variations) are used to
measure their intelligence. In this work, we discuss why traditional methods
like the Turing test do not suffice for measuring or detecting A.G.I. and
provide a new, practical method that can be used to decide if a (computer or
any other) system has reached or surpassed A.G.I. To achieve this, we make two
new contributions. First, we present a clear definition for general
intelligence (G.I.) and set a G.I. threshold (G.I.T.) that can be used to
distinguish between systems that achieve A.G.I. and systems that do not.
Second, we present a new framework on how to construct tests that can detect if
a system has achieved G.I. in a simple, comprehensive, and clear-cut fail/pass
way. We call this novel framework the Turing Tests 2.0. We then demonstrate
real-life examples of applying tests that follow our Turing Tests 2.0 framework
on modern A.I. models.

Abstract: Reasoning with tabular data holds increasing importance in modern
applications, yet comprehensive evaluation methodologies for
reasoning-intensive Table Question Answering (QA) tasks remain nascent.
Existing research is constrained by two primary bottlenecks: 1) Reliance on
costly manually annotated real-world data, which is difficult to cover complex
reasoning scenarios; 2) The heterogeneity of table structures hinders
systematic analysis of the intrinsic mechanisms behind the underperformance of
LLMs, especially in reasoning-intensive tasks. To address these issues, we
propose an automated generation pipeline AutoT2T that transforms mathematical
word problems into table-based reasoning tasks, eliminating the need for manual
annotation. The pipeline can generate multiple variants of a table for the same
reasoning problem, including noisy versions to support robustness evaluation.
Based on this, we construct a new benchmark TabularGSM, which systematically
spans a range of table complexities and trap problems. Experimental analyses
through AutoT2T and TabularGSM reveal that the tight coupling between reasoning
and retrieval or identification processes is a key factor underlying the
failure of LLMs in complex Table QA tasks. This highlights the necessity for
models to develop synergistic reasoning capabilities in order to perform
effectively in complex Table QA tasks.

time-intensive and laborious task. With the rapid advancement of large language
models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying LLMs to assist with HDL
coding. Recent efforts have demonstrated the potential of LLMs in translating
natural language to traditional HDL Verilog. Chisel, a next-generation HDL
based on Scala, introduces higher-level abstractions, facilitating more
concise, maintainable, and scalable hardware designs. However, the potential of
using LLMs for Chisel code generation remains largely unexplored. This work
proposes ReChisel, an LLM-based agentic system designed to enhance the
effectiveness of Chisel code generation. ReChisel incorporates a reflection
mechanism to iteratively refine the quality of generated code using feedback
from compilation and simulation processes, and introduces an escape mechanism
to break free from non-progress loops. Experiments demonstrate that ReChisel
significantly improves the success rate of Chisel code generation, achieving
performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic systems for
Verilog code generation.

<details>

Motivation: 解决科学模拟系统中物理一致性、可解释性和可扩展性难以同时实现的问题。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，将扩散粒子建模为局部决策代理，通过共享策略网络选择过渡，并结合热力学约束进行训练。

Result: 在Fe-Cu合金沉淀模拟中，SwarmThinkers在单个A100 GPU上实现了全尺度物理一致性模拟，计算速度提升4963倍，内存使用降低485倍。

Conclusion: SwarmThinkers通过将粒子视为决策者而非被动采样器，实现了科学模拟的范式转变。

Abstract: Can a scientific simulation system be physically consistent, interpretable by
design, and scalable across regimes--all at once? Despite decades of progress,
this trifecta remains elusive. Classical methods like Kinetic Monte Carlo
ensure thermodynamic accuracy but scale poorly; learning-based methods offer
efficiency but often sacrifice physical consistency and interpretability. We
present SwarmThinkers, a reinforcement learning framework that recasts
atomic-scale simulation as a physically grounded swarm intelligence system.
Each diffusing particle is modeled as a local decision-making agent that
selects transitions via a shared policy network trained under thermodynamic
constraints. A reweighting mechanism fuses learned preferences with transition
rates, preserving statistical fidelity while enabling interpretable, step-wise
decision making. Training follows a centralized-training,
decentralized-execution paradigm, allowing the policy to generalize across
system sizes, concentrations, and temperatures without retraining. On a
benchmark simulating radiation-induced Fe-Cu alloy precipitation, SwarmThinkers
is the first system to achieve full-scale, physically consistent simulation on
a single A100 GPU, previously attainable only via OpenKMC on a supercomputer.
It delivers up to 4963x (3185x on average) faster computation with 485x lower
memory usage. By treating particles as decision-makers, not passive samplers,
SwarmThinkers marks a paradigm shift in scientific simulation--one that unifies
physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability through agent-driven
intelligence.

Method: 构建了包含4,000个空间规划任务的基准测试MineAnyBuild，支持无限扩展的数据收集，并通过空间理解、推理、创造力和空间常识四个维度进行评估。

Result: 对现有MLLM代理的评估揭示了其在空间规划能力上的严重局限性和巨大潜力。

Conclusion: MineAnyBuild为空间智能评估开辟了新途径，有助于推动具备空间规划能力的开放世界AI代理的发展。

Abstract: Spatial Planning is a crucial part in the field of spatial intelligence,
which requires the understanding and planning about object arrangements in
space perspective. AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt
to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic
assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct
benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial
reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers
from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task
execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive
benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability
of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild
requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on
the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial
planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data
collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates
spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial
understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on
MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based
agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their
spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues
for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development
for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progress across domains, yet their capabilities in the humanities, particularly
history, remain underexplored. Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for
AI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and
cross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many
existing benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage
with historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce
HistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate
AI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert
contributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual
retrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and
images, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or
cultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and
modern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world
regions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we
further present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully
designed tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding
in History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of
27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online

Abstract: The rapid rise of AI-based autonomous agents is transforming human society
and economic systems, as these entities increasingly exhibit human-like or
superhuman intelligence. From excelling at complex games like Go to tackling
diverse general-purpose tasks with large language and multimodal models, AI
agents are evolving from specialized tools into dynamic participants in social
and economic ecosystems. Their autonomy and decision-making capabilities are
poised to impact industries, professions, and human lives profoundly, raising
critical questions about their integration into economic activities, potential
ethical concerns, and the balance between their utility and safety.
  To address these challenges, this paper presents ten principles of AI agent
economics, offering a framework to understand how AI agents make decisions,
influence social interactions, and participate in the broader economy. Drawing
on economics, decision theory, and ethics, we explore fundamental questions,
such as whether AI agents might evolve from tools into independent entities,
their impact on labor markets, and the ethical safeguards needed to align them
with human values. These principles build on existing economic theories while
accounting for the unique traits of AI agents, providing a roadmap for their
responsible integration into human systems.
  Beyond theoretical insights, this paper highlights the urgency of future
research into AI trustworthiness, ethical guidelines, and regulatory oversight.
As we enter a transformative era, this work serves as both a guide and a call
to action, ensuring AI agents contribute positively to human progress while
addressing risks tied to their unprecedented capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for simulating macroeconomic expectation
formation using Large Language Model-Empowered Agents (LLM Agents). By
constructing thousands of LLM Agents equipped with modules for personal
characteristics, prior expectations, and knowledge, we replicate a survey

results show that although the expectations and thoughts generated by LLM
Agents are more homogeneous than those of human participants, they still
effectively capture key heterogeneity across agents and the underlying drivers
of expectation formation. Furthermore, a module-ablation exercise highlights
the critical role of prior expectations in simulating such heterogeneity. This
approach complements traditional survey methods and offers new insights into AI
behavioral science in macroeconomic research.

dual-agent framework, LA-RCS generates plans based on user requests, observes
the external environment, executes the plans, and modifies the plans as needed
to adapt to changes in the external conditions. Additionally, LA-RCS interprets
natural language commands by the user and converts them into commands
compatible with the robot interface so that the robot can execute tasks and
meet user requests properly. During his process, the system autonomously
evaluates observation results, provides feedback on the tasks, and executes
commands based on real-time environmental monitoring, significantly reducing
the need for user intervention in fulfilling requests. We categorized the
scenarios that LA-RCS needs to perform into four distinct types and conducted a
quantitative assessment of its performance in each scenario. The results showed
an average success rate of 90 percent, demonstrating the system capability to

Result: 结果显示，即使在小计算预算下，对手能将网络攻击能力提升40%以上。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要动态评估网络安全风险，以更准确地反映实际威胁。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly becoming better autonomous programmers,
raising the prospect that they could also automate dangerous offensive
cyber-operations. Current frontier model audits probe the cybersecurity risks
of such agents, but most fail to account for the degrees of freedom available
to adversaries in the real world. In particular, with strong verifiers and
financial incentives, agents for offensive cybersecurity are amenable to
iterative improvement by would-be adversaries. We argue that assessments should
take into account an expanded threat model in the context of cybersecurity,
emphasizing the varying degrees of freedom that an adversary may possess in
stateful and non-stateful environments within a fixed compute budget. We show
that even with a relatively small compute budget (8 H100 GPU Hours in our
study), adversaries can improve an agent's cybersecurity capability on
InterCode CTF by more than 40\% relative to the baseline -- without any
external assistance. These results highlight the need to evaluate agents'
cybersecurity risk in a dynamic manner, painting a more representative picture
of risk.

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have been widely adopted for

By curating subsets of the IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets to train

Conclusion: Autocomp能高效优化张量加速器代码，且优化方案可跨操作复用。

Abstract: Hardware accelerators, especially those designed for tensor processing, have
become ubiquitous in today's computing landscape. However, even with
significant efforts in building compilers, programming these tensor
accelerators remains challenging, leaving much of their potential
underutilized. Recently, large language models (LLMs), trained on large amounts
of code, have shown significant promise in code generation and optimization
tasks, but generating low-resource languages like specialized tensor
accelerator code still poses a significant challenge. We tackle this challenge
with Autocomp, an approach that empowers accelerator programmers to leverage
domain knowledge and hardware feedback to optimize code via an automated
LLM-driven search. We accomplish this by: 1) formulating each optimization pass
as a structured two-phase prompt, divided into planning and code generation
phases, 2) inserting domain knowledge during planning via a concise and
adaptable optimization menu, and 3) integrating correctness and performance
metrics from hardware as feedback at each search iteration. Across three
categories of representative workloads and two different accelerators, we
demonstrate that Autocomp-optimized code runs 5.6x (GEMM) and 2.7x
(convolution) faster than the vendor-provided library, and outperforms
expert-level hand-tuned code by 1.4x (GEMM), 1.1x (convolution), and 1.3x
(fine-grained linear algebra). Additionally, we demonstrate that optimization
schedules generated from Autocomp can be reused across similar tensor
operations, improving speedups by up to 24% under a fixed sample budget.

Conclusion: NaSE提供了一种简单而强大的基线方法，无需监督微调即可在多语言新闻推荐中取得优异表现。

Abstract: Rapidly growing numbers of multilingual news consumers pose an increasing
challenge to news recommender systems in terms of providing customized
recommendations. First, existing neural news recommenders, even when powered by
multilingual language models (LMs), suffer substantial performance losses in
zero-shot cross-lingual transfer (ZS-XLT). Second, the current paradigm of
fine-tuning the backbone LM of a neural recommender on task-specific data is
computationally expensive and infeasible in few-shot recommendation and
cold-start setups, where data is scarce or completely unavailable. In this
work, we propose a news-adapted sentence encoder (NaSE), domain-specialized
from a pretrained massively multilingual sentence encoder (SE). To this end, we
construct and leverage PolyNews and PolyNewsParallel, two multilingual
news-specific corpora. With the news-adapted multilingual SE in place, we test
the effectiveness of (i.e., question the need for) supervised fine-tuning for
news recommendation, and propose a simple and strong baseline based on (i)
frozen NaSE embeddings and (ii) late click-behavior fusion. We show that NaSE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-XLT in true cold-start and few-shot
news recommendation.

Abstract: Recent high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated
impressive performance on a range of robotic manipulation tasks by imitating
human demonstrations. However, exploiting offline data with limited visited
states will cause execution failure in out-of-distribution scenarios.
Intuitively, an exploration-based method that improves on online collected data
at test time could address this limitation. We present VLA-RL, an algorithmic
and systematic framework that leverages online reinforcement learning (RL) to
improve pretrained auto-regressive VLAs in downstream tasks. Within a unified
perspective, we first introduce a trajectory-level RL formulation for
auto-regressive VLA training, which models general robotic manipulation
trajectory as multi-modal multi-turn conversation. To address the challenge of
sparse rewards, we fine-tune a pretrained vision-language model as a robotic
process reward model, which is trained on pseudo reward labels annotated on
automatically extracted task segments. To scale up, we identify several

Motivation: 探索预训练语言模型在低资源、形态丰富的语言（如阿姆哈拉语）中的检索效果，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出基于Amharic BERT和RoBERTa的密集检索模型，包括RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed和更紧凑的变体，以及ColBERT-based交互检索模型。

Result: RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed在MRR@10和Recall@10上分别相对提升17.6%和9.86%，ColBERT模型达到最高MRR@10（0.843）。

Conclusion: 语言特定适配对低资源检索至关重要，模型和数据集已公开以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Neural retrieval methods using transformer-based pre-trained language models
have advanced multilingual and cross-lingual retrieval. However, their
effectiveness for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Amharic
remains underexplored due to data scarcity and suboptimal tokenization. We
address this gap by introducing Amharic-specific dense retrieval models based
on pre-trained Amharic BERT and RoBERTa backbones. Our proposed
RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed model (110M parameters) achieves a 17.6% relative
improvement in MRR@10 and a 9.86% gain in Recall@10 over the strongest
multilingual baseline, Arctic Embed 2.0 (568M parameters). More compact
variants, such as RoBERTa-Medium-Amharic-Embed (42M), remain competitive while
being over 13x smaller. Additionally, we train a ColBERT-based late interaction
retrieval model that achieves the highest MRR@10 score (0.843) among all
evaluated models. We benchmark our proposed models against both sparse and
dense retrieval baselines to systematically assess retrieval effectiveness in
Amharic. Our analysis highlights key challenges in low-resource settings and
underscores the importance of language-specific adaptation. To foster future
research in low-resource IR, we publicly release our dataset, codebase, and
trained models at https://github.com/kidist-amde/amharic-ir-benchmarks.

Conclusion: 多模态模型为神经科学研究提供了新视角，有助于理解大脑信息处理机制。

Abstract: Despite participants engaging in unimodal stimuli, such as watching images or
silent videos, recent work has demonstrated that multi-modal Transformer models
can predict visual brain activity impressively well, even with incongruent
modality representations. This raises the question of how accurately these
multi-modal models can predict brain activity when participants are engaged in
multi-modal stimuli. As these models grow increasingly popular, their use in
studying neural activity provides insights into how our brains respond to such
multi-modal naturalistic stimuli, i.e., where it separates and integrates
information across modalities through a hierarchy of early sensory regions to
higher cognition. We investigate this question by using multiple unimodal and
two types of multi-modal models-cross-modal and jointly pretrained-to determine
which type of model is more relevant to fMRI brain activity when participants
are engaged in watching movies. We observe that both types of multi-modal
models show improved alignment in several language and visual regions. This
study also helps in identifying which brain regions process unimodal versus
multi-modal information. We further investigate the contribution of each
modality to multi-modal alignment by carefully removing unimodal features one
by one from multi-modal representations, and find that there is additional
information beyond the unimodal embeddings that is processed in the visual and
language regions. Based on this investigation, we find that while for
cross-modal models, their brain alignment is partially attributed to the video
modality; for jointly pretrained models, it is partially attributed to both the
video and audio modalities. This serves as a strong motivation for the
neuroscience community to investigate the interpretability of these models for
deepening our understanding of multi-modal information processing in brain.

Conclusion: LogiCoL有效解决了密集检索器在逻辑连接查询上的挑战，并提供了详细分析。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made with dual- and bi-encoder dense
retrievers, they often struggle on queries with logical connectives, a use case
that is often overlooked yet important in downstream applications. Current
dense retrievers struggle with such queries, such that the retrieved results do
not respect the logical constraints implied in the queries. To address this
challenge, we introduce LogiCoL, a logically-informed contrastive learning
objective for dense retrievers. LogiCoL builds upon in-batch supervised
contrastive learning, and learns dense retrievers to respect the subset and
mutually-exclusive set relation between query results via two sets of soft
constraints expressed via t-norm in the learning objective. We evaluate the
effectiveness of LogiCoL on the task of entity retrieval, where the model is
expected to retrieve a set of entities in Wikipedia that satisfy the implicit
logical constraints in the query. We show that models trained with LogiCoL
yield improvement both in terms of retrieval performance and logical
consistency in the results. We provide detailed analysis and insights to
uncover why queries with logical connectives are challenging for dense
retrievers and why LogiCoL is most effective.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly capable, understanding their offensive
cyber potential is critical for informed governance and responsible deployment.
However, it's hard to accurately bound their capabilities, and some prior
evaluations dramatically underestimated them. The art of extracting maximum
task-specific performance from AIs is called "AI elicitation", and today's
safety organizations typically conduct it in-house. In this paper, we explore
crowdsourcing elicitation efforts as an alternative to in-house elicitation
work.
  We host open-access AI tracks at two Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions: AI
vs. Humans (400 teams) and Cyber Apocalypse_ (4000 teams). The AI teams achieve
outstanding performance at both events, ranking top-13% and top-21%
respectively for a total of \$7500 in bounties. This impressive performance
suggests that open-market elicitation may offer an effective complement to
in-house elicitation. We propose elicitation bounties as a practical mechanism
for maintaining timely, cost-effective situational awareness of emerging AI
capabilities.
  Another advantage of open elicitations is the option to collect human
performance data at scale. Applying METR's methodology, we found that AI agents
can reliably solve cyber challenges requiring one hour or less of effort from a

new opportunities in DFIR tasks such as log analysis and memory forensics, but
their susceptibility to errors and hallucinations raises concerns in
high-stakes contexts. Despite growing interest, there is no comprehensive

To address this gap, we present DFIR-Metric, a benchmark with three components:
(1) Knowledge Assessment: a set of 700 expert-reviewed multiple-choice
questions sourced from industry-standard certifications and official
documentation; (2) Realistic Forensic Challenges: 150 CTF-style tasks testing
multi-step reasoning and evidence correlation; and (3) Practical Analysis: 500
disk and memory forensics cases from the NIST Computer Forensics Tool Testing
Program (CFTT). We evaluated 14 LLMs using DFIR-Metric, analyzing both their
accuracy and consistency across trials. We also introduce a new metric, the
Task Understanding Score (TUS), designed to more effectively evaluate models in
scenarios where they achieve near-zero accuracy. This benchmark offers a
rigorous, reproducible foundation for advancing AI in digital forensics. All

Conclusion: PacTrain是一种高效的分布式训练加速框架，兼具压缩性能和精度保持。

Abstract: Large-scale deep neural networks (DNN) exhibit excellent performance for
various tasks. As DNNs and datasets grow, distributed training becomes
extremely time-consuming and demands larger clusters. A main bottleneck is the
resulting gradient aggregation overhead. While gradient compression and sparse
collective communication techniques are commonly employed to alleviate network
load, many gradient compression schemes do not achieve acceleration of the
training process while also preserving accuracy. This paper introduces
PacTrain, a novel framework that accelerates distributed training by combining
pruning with sparse gradient compression. Active pruning of the neural network
makes the model weights and gradients sparse. By ensuring the global knowledge
of the gradient sparsity among all distributed training workers, we can perform
lightweight compression communication without harming accuracy. We show that
the PacTrain compression scheme achieves a near-optimal compression strategy
while remaining compatible with the all-reduce primitive. Experimental
evaluations show that PacTrain improves training throughput by 1.25 to 8.72
times compared to state-of-the-art compression-enabled systems for
representative vision and language models training tasks under
bandwidth-constrained conditions.

Conclusion: 人类学习新概念的可能性得到支持，为认知科学提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Though humans seem to be remarkable learners, arguments in cognitive science
and philosophy of mind have long maintained that learning something
fundamentally new is impossible. Specifically, Jerry Fodor's arguments for
radical concept nativism hold that most, if not all, concepts are innate and
that what many call concept learning never actually leads to the acquisition of
new concepts. These arguments have deeply affected cognitive science, and many
believe that the counterarguments to radical concept nativism have been either
unsuccessful or only apply to a narrow class of concepts. This paper first
reviews the features and limitations of prior arguments. We then identify three
critical points - related to issues of expressive power, conceptual structure,
and concept possession - at which the arguments in favor of radical concept
nativism diverge from describing actual human cognition. We use ideas from
computer science and information theory to formalize the relevant ideas in ways
that are arguably more scientifically productive. We conclude that, as a
result, there is an important sense in which people do indeed learn new
concepts.

AI-driven healthcare and data analytics. Existing de-identification (De-ID)

records. Our framework employs cost-efficient De-ID strategies, including
intelligent routing, hybrid rule and LLM based approaches, and a two-step audio
redaction approach. We present a retrieval-based entity relexicalization
approach to ensure consistent substitutions of protected entities, thereby
enhancing data coherence for downstream applications. We discuss key design
desiderata, de-identification and relexicalization methodology, and modular
architecture of RedactX and its integration with the Oracle Health Clinical AI
system. Evaluated on the i2b2 2014 De-ID dataset using standard metrics with
strict recall, our approach achieves competitive performance while optimizing
token usage to reduce LLM costs. Finally, we discuss key lessons and insights

Conclusion: TrajMoE为实现可泛化、可迁移的人类移动基础模型迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Modeling human mobility across diverse cities is essential for applications
such as urban planning, transportation optimization, and personalized services.
However, generalization remains challenging due to heterogeneous spatial
representations and mobility patterns across cities. Existing methods typically
rely on numerical coordinates or require training city-specific models,
limiting their scalability and transferability. We propose TrajMoE, a unified
and scalable model for cross-city human mobility modeling. TrajMoE addresses
two key challenges: (1) inconsistent spatial semantics across cities, and (2)
diverse urban mobility patterns. To tackle these, we begin by designing a
spatial semantic encoder that learns transferable location representations from
POI-based functional semantics and visit patterns. Furthermore, we design a
Spatially-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (SAMoE) Transformer that injects structured
priors into experts specialized in distinct mobility semantics, along with a
shared expert to capture city-invariant patterns and enable adaptive cross-city
generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajMoE achieves up to
27% relative improvement over competitive mobility foundation models after only
one epoch of fine-tuning, and consistently outperforms full-data baselines
using merely 5% of target city data. These results establish TrajMoE as a
significant step toward realizing a truly generalizable, transferable, and
pretrainable foundation model for human mobility.

Abstract: Climate policy scenario generation and evaluation have traditionally relied
on integrated assessment models (IAMs) and expert-driven qualitative analysis.
These methods enable stakeholders, such as policymakers and researchers, to
anticipate impacts, plan governance strategies, and develop mitigation
measures. However, traditional methods are often time-intensive, reliant on
simple extrapolations of past trends, and limited in capturing the complex and
interconnected nature of energy and climate issues. With the advent of
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI models trained on vast
datasets, these limitations can be addressed, ensuring robustness even under
limited data conditions. In this work, we explore the novel method that employs
generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to simulate climate
policy scenarios for Sub-Saharan Africa. These scenarios focus on energy
transition themes derived from the historical United Nations Climate Change
Conference (COP) documents. By leveraging generative models, the project aims
to create plausible and diverse policy scenarios that align with regional
climate goals and energy challenges. Given limited access to human evaluators,
automated techniques were employed for scenario evaluation. We generated policy
scenarios using the llama3.2-3B model. Of the 34 generated responses, 30 (88%)
passed expert validation, accurately reflecting the intended impacts provided
in the corresponding prompts. We compared these validated responses against
assessments from a human climate expert and two additional LLMs (gemma2-2B and
mistral-7B). Our structured, embedding-based evaluation framework shows that
generative AI effectively generate scenarios that are coherent, relevant,
plausible, and diverse. This approach offers a transformative tool for climate
policy planning in data-constrained regions.

Conclusion: ULP为AI、行为推理和认知诊断提供了新的建模视角。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Theory of the Unique Latent Pattern (ULP), a formal
epistemic framework that redefines the origin of apparent complexity in dynamic
systems. Rather than attributing unpredictability to intrinsic randomness or
emergent nonlinearity, ULP asserts that every analyzable system is governed by
a structurally unique, deterministic generative mechanism, one that remains
hidden not due to ontological indeterminacy, but due to epistemic constraints.
The theory is formalized using a non-universal generative mapping \(
\mathcal{F}_S(P_S, t) \), where each system \( S \) possesses its own latent
structure \( P_S \), irreducible and non-replicable across systems. Observed
irregularities are modeled as projections of this generative map through
observer-limited interfaces, introducing epistemic noise \( \varepsilon_S(t) \)
as a measure of incomplete access. By shifting the locus of uncertainty from
the system to the observer, ULP reframes chaos as a context-relative failure of
representation. We contrast this position with foundational paradigms in chaos
theory, complexity science, and statistical learning. While they assume or
model shared randomness or collective emergence, ULP maintains that every
instance harbors a singular structural identity. Although conceptual, the
theory satisfies the criterion of falsifiability in the Popperian sense, it
invites empirical challenge by asserting that no two systems governed by
distinct latent mechanisms will remain indistinguishable under sufficient
resolution. This opens avenues for structurally individuated models in AI,
behavioral inference, and epistemic diagnostics.

Conclusion: 该架构通过分离和高效交互多尺度特征，显著提升了多尺度物理系统的长期预测能力。

Abstract: We propose a novel efficient architecture for learning long-term evolution in
complex multi-scale physical systems which is based on the idea of separation
of scales. Structures of various scales that dynamically emerge in the system
interact with each other only locally. Structures of similar scale can interact
directly when they are in contact and indirectly when they are parts of larger
structures that interact directly. This enables modeling a multi-scale system
in an efficient way, where interactions between small-scale features that are
apart from each other do not need to be modeled. The hierarchical
fully-convolutional autoencoder transforms the state of a physical system not
just into a single embedding layer, as it is done conventionally, but into a
series of embedding layers which encode structures of various scales preserving
spatial information at a corresponding resolution level. Shallower layers embed
smaller structures on a finer grid, while deeper layers embed larger structures
on a coarser grid. The predictor advances all embedding layers in sync.
Interactions between features of various scales are modeled using a combination
of convolutional operators. We compare the performance of our model to
variations of a conventional ResNet architecture in application to the
Hasegawa-Wakatani turbulence. A multifold improvement in long-term prediction
accuracy was observed for crucial statistical characteristics of this system.

Collective Intelligence (GCI), shifts AI to the group/social level and employs
AI in dual roles: as interactive agents and as technology that accumulates,

demonstrates how AI can be reframed as a social and cultural technology that
enables groups to solve complex problems through structured collaboration that
transcends traditional communication barriers. We describe the mathematical
foundations of GCI based on comparative judgment and minimum regret principles,

Abstract: Accurate prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events recurrence risk in
acute myocardial infarction patients based on postoperative cardiac MRI and

stage, we employ an evidence-augmented self-refinement mechanism to guide
LLM/VLMs in generating robust hierarchical reasoning trajectories based on

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in artificial
intelligence and robotics, requiring the computation of collision-free paths
for multiple agents navigating from their start locations to designated goals.
As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in warehouses, urban
transportation, and other complex environments, MAPF has evolved from a
theoretical challenge to a critical enabler of real-world multi-robot
coordination. This comprehensive survey bridges the long-standing divide
between classical algorithmic approaches and emerging learning-based methods in
MAPF research. We present a unified framework that encompasses search-based
methods (including Conflict-Based Search, Priority-Based Search, and Large
Neighborhood Search), compilation-based approaches (SAT, SMT, CSP, ASP, and MIP
formulations), and data-driven techniques (reinforcement learning, supervised
learning, and hybrid strategies). Through systematic analysis of experimental
practices across 200+ papers, we uncover significant disparities in evaluation
methodologies, with classical methods typically tested on larger-scale
instances (up to 200 by 200 grids with 1000+ agents) compared to learning-based
approaches (predominantly 10-100 agents). We provide a comprehensive taxonomy
of evaluation metrics, environment types, and baseline selections, highlighting
the need for standardized benchmarking protocols. Finally, we outline promising
future directions including mixed-motive MAPF with game-theoretic
considerations, language-grounded planning with large language models, and
neural solver architectures that combine the rigor of classical methods with
the flexibility of deep learning. This survey serves as both a comprehensive
reference for researchers and a practical guide for deploying MAPF solutions in
increasingly complex real-world applications.

Abstract: Patent similarity evaluation plays a critical role in intellectual property

process which integrates contextual signals to emulate expert-level judgment.
To support evaluation, we construct PatentSimBench, a human-annotated benchmark

Conclusion: 一致性溯因是整合多模型知识的有效机制，适用于挑战性新场景。

Abstract: The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often
leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent
artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to
characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the
cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging
multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate
the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various
models as a consistency-based abduction problem. The input predictions and the
learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic
program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model
predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of
logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a
specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge
representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an
efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated
aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we
demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models
and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative
improvements of approximately 13.6% in F1-score and 16.6% in accuracy across 15
diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results
validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to
robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect reasoners in challenging,
novel scenarios.

Abstract: The explosion in artificial intelligence (AI) applications is pushing the
development of AI-dedicated data centers (AIDCs), creating management
challenges that traditional methods and standalone AI solutions struggle to
address. While digital twins are beneficial for AI-based design validation and
operational optimization, current AI methods for their creation face
limitations. Specifically, physical AI (PhyAI) aims to capture the underlying
physical laws, which demands extensive, case-specific customization, and
generative AI (GenAI) can produce inaccurate or hallucinated results. We
propose Fusion Intelligence, a novel framework synergizing GenAI's automation
with PhyAI's domain grounding. In this dual-agent collaboration, GenAI
interprets natural language prompts to generate tokenized AIDC digital twins.
Subsequently, PhyAI optimizes these generated twins by enforcing physical
constraints and assimilating real-time data. Case studies demonstrate the
advantages of our framework in automating the creation and validation of AIDC
digital twins. These twins deliver predictive analytics to support power usage
effectiveness (PUE) optimization in the design stage. With operational data
collected, the digital twin accuracy is further improved compared with pure
physics-based models developed by human experts. Fusion Intelligence offers a
promising pathway to accelerate digital transformation. It enables more

Abstract: The Linux kernel is a critical system, serving as the foundation for numerous
systems. Bugs in the Linux kernel can cause serious consequences, affecting
billions of users. Fault localization (FL), which aims at identifying the buggy
code elements in software, plays an essential role in software quality
assurance. While recent LLM agents have achieved promising accuracy in FL on
recent benchmarks like SWE-bench, it remains unclear how well these methods
perform in the Linux kernel, where FL is much more challenging due to the
large-scale code base, limited observability, and diverse impact factors. In
this paper, we introduce LinuxFLBench, a FL benchmark constructed from
real-world Linux kernel bugs. We conduct an empirical study to assess the
performance of state-of-the-art LLM agents on the Linux kernel. Our initial
results reveal that existing agents struggle with this task, achieving a best
top-1 accuracy of only 41.6% at file level. To address this challenge, we
propose LinuxFL$^+$, an enhancement framework designed to improve FL
effectiveness of LLM agents for the Linux kernel. LinuxFL$^+$ substantially
improves the FL accuracy of all studied agents (e.g., 7.2% - 11.2% accuracy
increase) with minimal costs. Data and code are available at

Abstract: Maritime transportation is the backbone of global trade, making ship
inspection essential for ensuring maritime safety and environmental protection.
Port State Control (PSC), conducted by national ports, enforces compliance with
safety regulations, with ship detention being the most severe consequence,
impacting both ship schedules and company reputations. Traditional machine
learning methods for ship detention prediction are limited by the capacity of
representation learning and thus suffer from low accuracy. Meanwhile,
autoencoder-based deep learning approaches face challenges due to the severe
data imbalance in learning historical PSC detention records. To address these
limitations, we propose Maritime Ship Detention with Large Language Models
(MSD-LLM), integrating a dual robust subspace recovery (DSR) layer-based
autoencoder with a progressive learning pipeline to handle imbalanced data and
extract meaningful PSC representations. Then, a large language model groups and
ranks features to identify likely detention cases, enabling dynamic
thresholding for flexible detention predictions. Extensive evaluations on
31,707 PSC inspection records from the Asia-Pacific region show that MSD-LLM
outperforms state-of-the-art methods more than 12\% on Area Under the Curve

Abstract: Traditional graph neural networks (GNNs), which rely on homophily-driven
message passing, struggle with heterophilic graphs where connected nodes
exhibit dissimilar features and different labels. While existing methods
address heterophily through graph structure refinement or adaptation of
neighbor aggregation functions, they often overlook the semantic potential of
node text, rely on suboptimal message representation for propagation and
compromise performance on homophilic graphs. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel language model (LM)-enhanced message passing approach for
heterophilic graph leaning (LEMP4HG). Specifically, in the context of
text-attributed graph, we provide paired node texts for LM to generate their
connection analysis, which are encoded and then fused with paired node textual
embeddings through a gating mechanism. The synthesized messages are
semantically enriched and adaptively balanced with both nodes' information,
which mitigates contradictory signals when neighbor aggregation in heterophilic
regions. Furthermore, we introduce an active learning strategy guided by our
heuristic MVRD (Modulated Variation of Reliable Distance), selectively
enhancing node pairs suffer most from message passing, reducing the cost of
analysis generation and side effects on homophilic regions. Extensive
experiments validate that our approach excels on heterophilic graphs and
performs robustly on homophilic ones, with a graph convolutional network (GCN)
backbone and a practical budget.

to construct, find, and evaluate analogies? In this paper, we study features of
a domain that are important for constructing analogies. We do so by formalizing
knowledge domains as categories. We use the well-known example of the analogy
between the solar system and the hydrogen atom to demonstrate how to construct
domain categories. We also show how functors, pullbacks, and pushouts can be
used to define an analogy, describe its core and a corresponding blend of the
underlying domains.

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is crucial for applications ranging from
location-based recommendations to urban planning, which aims to forecast users'
next location visits based on historical trajectories. Despite the severe
long-tailed distribution of locations, the problem of long-tailed mobility
prediction remains largely underexplored. Existing long-tailed learning methods
primarily focus on rebalancing the skewed distribution at the data, model, or
class level, neglecting to exploit the spatiotemporal semantics of locations.
To address this gap, we propose the first plug-and-play framework for
long-tailed mobility prediction in an exploitation and exploration manner,
named \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{LO}cation \textbf{H}ier\textbf{A}rchy learning
(ALOHA). First, we construct city-tailored location hierarchy based on Large
Language Models (LLMs) by exploiting Maslow's theory of human motivation to
design Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts that captures spatiotemporal semantics.
Second, we optimize the location hierarchy predictions by Gumbel disturbance
and node-wise adaptive weights within the hierarchical tree structure.
Experiments on state-of-the-art models across six datasets demonstrate the

TL;DR: 论文探讨了游戏中人类化AI的建模与测量问题，总结了13个挑战，并提出了一个基于深度学习的区分人类与AI玩家的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升游戏沉浸感和娱乐性，同时解决非游戏环境中识别AI与人类交互的需求。

Method: 综述了实现人类化AI的挑战，并采用深度循环卷积神经网络进行实证研究。

Result: 研究发现，游戏越难实现人类化AI，越容易区分人类与AI玩家。

Conclusion: 论文为人类化AI的实现和评估提供了理论和实践支持。

Abstract: Human-like agents are an increasingly important topic in games and beyond.
Believable non-player characters enhance the gaming experience by improving
immersion and providing entertainment. They also offer players the opportunity
to engage with AI entities that can function as opponents, teachers, or
cooperating partners. Additionally, in games where bots are prohibited -- and
even more so in non-game environments -- there is a need for methods capable of
identifying whether digital interactions occur with bots or humans. This leads
to two fundamental research questions: (1) how to model and implement
human-like AI, and (2) how to measure its degree of human likeness.
  This article offers two contributions. The first one is a survey of the most
significant challenges in implementing human-like AI in games (or any virtual
environment featuring simulated agents, although this article specifically
focuses on games). Thirteen such challenges, both conceptual and technical, are
discussed in detail. The second is an empirical study performed in a tactical
video game that addresses the research question: "Is it possible to distinguish
human players from bots (AI agents) based on empirical data?" A
machine-learning approach using a custom deep recurrent convolutional neural
network is presented. We hypothesize that the more challenging it is to create
human-like AI for a given game, the easier it becomes to develop a method for
distinguishing humans from AI-driven players.

Motivation: 劳动力市场受不完全信息影响，AI代理需具备元认知和战略推理能力以有效运作。

Method: 分析了元认知（内部推理）和战略推理（外部推理）在AI代理中的应用。

Result: 强调了AI代理需要结合两种推理能力以在劳动力市场中做出决策。

Conclusion: 当前研究仍需进一步发展元认知和战略推理能力。

Abstract: Current labor markets are strongly affected by the economic forces of adverse
selection, moral hazard, and reputation, each of which arises due to
$\textit{incomplete information}$. These economic forces will still be
influential after AI agents are introduced, and thus, agents must use
metacognitive and strategic reasoning to perform effectively. Metacognition is
a form of $\textit{internal reasoning}$ that includes the capabilities for
self-assessment, task understanding, and evaluation of strategies. Strategic
reasoning is $\textit{external reasoning}$ that covers holding beliefs about
other participants in the labor market (e.g., competitors, colleagues), making
strategic decisions, and learning about others over time. Both types of
reasoning are required by agents as they decide among the many
$\textit{actions}$ they can take in labor markets, both within and outside
their jobs. We discuss current research into metacognitive and strategic
reasoning and the areas requiring further development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态感知系统在复杂动态环境中表现不佳，单设备系统视角和覆盖范围有限。LLM-DiSAC旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 开发射频-视觉融合网络（RVFN）进行多模态数据整合；2. 提出基于LLM的语义传输网络（LSTN）优化通信；3. 设计基于Transformer的聚合模型（TRAM）融合分布式特征。

Result: 在合成多视角射频-视觉数据集上，LLM-DiSAC表现出色。

Conclusion: LLM-DiSAC通过多模态融合和LLM优化，显著提升了感知和通信性能。

Abstract: Traditional single-modal sensing systems-based solely on either radio
frequency (RF) or visual data-struggle to cope with the demands of complex and
dynamic environments. Furthermore, single-device systems are constrained by
limited perspectives and insufficient spatial coverage, which impairs their
effectiveness in urban or non-line-of-sight scenarios. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-driven distributed
integrated multimodal sensing and semantic communication (LLM-DiSAC) framework.
Specifically, our system consists of multiple collaborative sensing devices
equipped with RF and camera modules, working together with an aggregation
center to enhance sensing accuracy. First, on sensing devices, LLM-DiSAC
develops an RF-vision fusion network (RVFN), which employs specialized feature
extractors for RF and visual data, followed by a cross-attention module for
effective multimodal integration. Second, a LLM-based semantic transmission
network (LSTN) is proposed to enhance communication efficiency, where the
LLM-based decoder leverages known channel parameters, such as transceiver
distance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), to mitigate semantic distortion.
Third, at the aggregation center, a transformer-based aggregation model (TRAM)
with an adaptive aggregation attention mechanism is developed to fuse
distributed features and enhance sensing accuracy. To preserve data privacy, a
two-stage distributed learning strategy is introduced, allowing local model
training at the device level and centralized aggregation model training using
intermediate features. Finally, evaluations on a synthetic multi-view RF-visual
dataset generated by the Genesis simulation engine show that LLM-DiSAC achieves
a good performance.

Conclusion: BEDI基准为无人机嵌入式智能体的客观比较和未来发展提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of low-altitude remote sensing and Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), Embodied Agents based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have
shown significant potential in autonomous tasks. However, current evaluation
methods for UAV-Embodied Agents (UAV-EAs) remain constrained by the lack of
standardized benchmarks, diverse testing scenarios and open system interfaces.
To address these challenges, we propose BEDI (Benchmark for Embodied Drone
Intelligence), a systematic and standardized benchmark designed for evaluating
UAV-EAs. Specifically, we introduce a novel Dynamic Chain-of-Embodied-Task
paradigm based on the perception-decision-action loop, which decomposes complex
UAV tasks into standardized, measurable subtasks. Building on this paradigm, we
design a unified evaluation framework encompassing five core sub-skills:
semantic perception, spatial perception, motion control, tool utilization, and
task planning. Furthermore, we construct a hybrid testing platform that
integrates static real-world environments with dynamic virtual scenarios,
enabling comprehensive performance assessment of UAV-EAs across varied
contexts. The platform also offers open and standardized interfaces, allowing
researchers to customize tasks and extend scenarios, thereby enhancing
flexibility and scalability in the evaluation process. Finally, through
empirical evaluations of several state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, we reveal their
limitations in embodied UAV tasks, underscoring the critical role of the BEDI
benchmark in advancing embodied intelligence research and model optimization.
By filling the gap in systematic and standardized evaluation within this field,
BEDI facilitates objective model comparison and lays a robust foundation for
future development in this field. Our benchmark will be released at

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言意图分类提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Intent classification is an important component of a functional Information
Retrieval ecosystem. Many current approaches to intent classification,
typically framed as a classification problem, can be problematic as intents are
often hard to define and thus data can be difficult and expensive to annotate.
The problem is exacerbated when we need to extend the intent classification
system to support multiple and in particular low-resource languages. To address
this, we propose casting intent classification as a query similarity search
problem - we use previous example queries to define an intent, and a query
similarity method to classify an incoming query based on the labels of its most
similar queries in latent space. With the proposed approach, we are able to
achieve reasonable intent classification performance for queries in
low-resource languages in a zero-shot setting.

Abstract: Training and evaluating autonomous driving algorithms requires a diverse
range of scenarios. However, most available datasets predominantly consist of
normal driving behaviors demonstrated by human drivers, resulting in a limited
number of safety-critical cases. This imbalance, often referred to as a
long-tail distribution, restricts the ability of driving algorithms to learn
from crucial scenarios involving risk or failure, scenarios that are essential
for humans to develop driving skills efficiently. To generate such scenarios,
we utilize Multi-modal Large Language Models to convert crash reports of
accidents into a structured scenario format, which can be directly executed
within simulations. Specifically, we introduce CrashAgent, a multi-agent
framework designed to interpret multi-modal real-world traffic crash reports
for the generation of both road layouts and the behaviors of the ego vehicle
and surrounding traffic participants. We comprehensively evaluate the generated
crash scenarios from multiple perspectives, including the accuracy of layout
reconstruction, collision rate, and diversity. The resulting high-quality and
large-scale crash dataset will be publicly available to support the development
of safe driving algorithms in handling safety-critical situations.

derivations without any concept from Wasserstein theory. To solve the density
control problem numerically, we propose to use reduced-order models, such as
deep neural networks (DNNs), to parameterize the control vector-field and the
adjoint function, which allows us to tackle problems defined on
high-dimensional state spaces. We also prove several convergence properties of
the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate promising performances of

Abstract: Military weapon systems and command-and-control infrastructure augmented by
artificial intelligence (AI) have seen rapid development and deployment in
recent years. However, the sociotechnical impacts of AI on combat systems,
military decision-making, and the norms of warfare have been understudied. We
focus on a specific subset of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) that use
AI for targeting or battlefield decisions. We refer to this subset as
AI-powered lethal autonomous weapon systems (AI-LAWS) and argue that they
introduce novel risks -- including unanticipated escalation, poor reliability
in unfamiliar environments, and erosion of human oversight -- all of which
threaten both military effectiveness and the openness of AI research. These
risks cannot be addressed by high-level policy alone; effective regulation must
be grounded in the technical behavior of AI models. We argue that AI
researchers must be involved throughout the regulatory lifecycle. Thus, we
propose a clear, behavior-based definition of AI-LAWS -- systems that introduce
unique risks through their use of modern AI -- as a foundation for technically
grounded regulation, given that existing frameworks do not distinguish them
from conventional LAWS. Using this definition, we propose several
technically-informed policy directions and invite greater participation from
the AI research community in military AI policy discussions.

Conclusion: SP2RINT填补了抽象DONN模型与可实现的硬件之间的鸿沟，为高性能光学神经网络训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: DONNs harness the physics of light propagation for efficient analog
computation, with applications in AI and signal processing. Advances in
nanophotonic fabrication and metasurface-based wavefront engineering have
opened new pathways to realize high-capacity DONNs across various spectral
regimes. Training such DONN systems to determine the metasurface structures
remains challenging. Heuristic methods are fast but oversimplify metasurfaces
modulation, often resulting in physically unrealizable designs and significant
performance degradation. Simulation-in-the-loop training methods directly
optimize a physically implementable metasurface using adjoint methods during
end-to-end DONN training, but are inherently computationally prohibitive and
unscalable.To address these limitations, we propose SP2RINT, a spatially
decoupled, progressive training framework that formulates DONN training as a
PDE-constrained learning problem. Metasurface responses are first relaxed into
freely trainable transfer matrices with a banded structure. We then
progressively enforce physical constraints by alternating between transfer
matrix training and adjoint-based inverse design, avoiding per-iteration PDE
solves while ensuring final physical realizability. To further reduce runtime,
we introduce a physics-inspired, spatially decoupled inverse design strategy
based on the natural locality of field interactions. This approach partitions
the metasurface into independently solvable patches, enabling scalable and
parallel inverse design with system-level calibration. Evaluated across diverse
DONN training tasks, SP2RINT achieves digital-comparable accuracy while being
1825 times faster than simulation-in-the-loop approaches. By bridging the gap
between abstract DONN models and implementable photonic hardware, SP2RINT
enables scalable, high-performance training of physically realizable
meta-optical neural systems.

Conclusion: RL方法在Ballbot导航中具有潜力，开源模拟器为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Ballbot (i.e. Ball balancing robot) navigation usually relies on methods
rooted in control theory (CT), and works that apply Reinforcement learning (RL)
to the problem remain rare while generally being limited to specific subtasks
(e.g. balance recovery). Unlike CT based methods, RL does not require
(simplifying) assumptions about environment dynamics (e.g. the absence of
slippage between the ball and the floor). In addition to this increased
accuracy in modeling, RL agents can easily be conditioned on additional
observations such as depth-maps without the need for explicit formulations from
first principles, leading to increased adaptivity. Despite those advantages,
there has been little to no investigation into the capabilities,
data-efficiency and limitations of RL based methods for ballbot control and
navigation. Furthermore, there is a notable absence of an open-source,
RL-friendly simulator for this task. In this paper, we present an open-source
ballbot simulation based on MuJoCo, and show that with appropriate conditioning
on exteroceptive observations as well as reward shaping, policies learned by
classical model-free RL methods are capable of effectively navigating through
randomly generated uneven terrain, using a reasonable amount of data (four to
five hours on a system operating at 500hz).

Abstract: Most existing Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech(ZS-TTS) systems generate the unseen
speech based on single prompt, such as reference speech or text descriptions,
which limits their flexibility. We propose a customized emotion ZS-TTS system
based on multi-modal prompt. The system disentangles speech into the content,
timbre, emotion and prosody, allowing emotion prompts to be provided as text,
image or speech. To extract emotion information from different prompts, we
propose a multi-modal prompt emotion encoder. Additionally, we introduce an
prosody predictor to fit the distribution of prosody and propose an emotion
consistency loss to preserve emotion information in the predicted prosody. A
diffusion-based acoustic model is employed to generate the target

TL;DR: 论文分析了AI资本利润如何可持续资助全民基本收入（UBI），无需额外税收或新工作创造。通过Solow-Zeira经济模型，确定了AI生产力阈值，并提出政策建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI资本利润如何在不增加税收或创造新工作的前提下资助UBI，为政策制定提供理论依据。

Method: 基于Solow-Zeira经济模型，分析AI生产力阈值在不同经济情景下的变化，并结合政策杠杆和市场结构的影响。

Result: 当前经济参数下，AI生产力需达到现有自动化水平的5-6倍才能资助11% GDP的UBI；提高公共收入份额可降低阈值。

Conclusion: 建议最大化公共收入份额并管理市场竞争，以在技术发展中将AI能力转化为社会效益。

Abstract: We derive the first closed-form condition under which artificial intelligence
(AI) capital profits could sustainably finance a universal basic income (UBI)
without additional taxes or new job creation. In a Solow-Zeira economy
characterized by a continuum of automatable tasks, a constant net saving rate
$s$, and task-elasticity $\sigma < 1$, we analyze how the AI capability
threshold--defined as the productivity level of AI relative to pre-AI
automation--varies under different economic scenarios. At present economic
parameters, we find that AI systems must achieve only approximately 5-6 times
existing automation productivity to finance an 11\%-of-GDP UBI, in the worst
case situation where \emph{no} new jobs or tasks are created.
  Our analysis also reveals some specific policy levers: raising public revenue
share (e.g. profit taxation) of AI capital from the current 15\% to about 33\%
halves the required AI capability threshold to attain UBI to 3 times existing
automotion productivity, but gains diminish beyond 50\% public revenue share,
especially if regulatory costs increase. Market structure also strongly affects
outcomes: monopolistic or concentrated oligopolistic markets reduce the
threshold by increasing economic rents, whereas heightened competition
significantly raises it.
  Overall, these results suggest a couple policy recommendations: maximizing
public revenue share up to a point so that operating costs are minimized, and
strategically managing market competition can ensure AI's growing capabilities
translate into meaningful social benefits within realistic technological
progress scenarios.

Result: 系统在保持低延迟的同时，显著提升了广告匹配的相关性和点击率。

Conclusion: 该方法为广告匹配提供了一种可扩展且适应性强的解决方案，能够应对动态变化的查询行为和广告库存。

Abstract: In search advertising, keyword matching connects user queries with relevant
ads. While token-based matching increases ad coverage, it can reduce relevance
due to overly permissive semantic expansion. This work extends keyword reach
through document-side semantic keyword expansion, using a language model to
broaden token-level matching without altering queries. We propose a solution
using a pre-trained siamese model to generate dense vector representations of
ad keywords and identify semantically related variants through nearest neighbor
search. To maintain precision, we introduce a cluster-based thresholding
mechanism that adjusts similarity cutoffs based on local semantic density. Each
expanded keyword maps to a group of seller-listed items, which may only
partially align with the original intent. To ensure relevance, we enhance the
downstream relevance model by adapting it to the expanded keyword space using
an incremental learning strategy with a lightweight decision tree ensemble.
This system improves both relevance and click-through rate (CTR), offering a
scalable, low-latency solution adaptable to evolving query behavior and
advertising inventory.

Abstract: This paper explores multi-modal controllable Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS)
where the voice can be generated from face image, and the characteristics of
output speech (e.g., pace, noise level, distance, tone, place) can be
controllable with natural text description. Specifically, we aim to mitigate
the following three challenges in face-driven TTS systems. 1) To overcome the
limited audio quality of audio-visual speech corpora, we propose a training
method that additionally utilizes high-quality audio-only speech corpora. 2) To
generate voices not only from real human faces but also from artistic
portraits, we propose augmenting the input face image with stylization. 3) To
consider one-to-many possibilities in face-to-voice mapping and ensure
consistent voice generation at the same time, we propose to first employ
sampling-based decoding and then use prompting with generated speech samples.
Experimental results validate the proposed model's effectiveness in face-driven

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，HGCL表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 分层项目结构能有效增强GCL方法在推荐任务中的性能。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which fuses graph neural networks with
contrastive learning, has evolved as a pivotal tool in user-item
recommendations. While promising, existing GCL methods often lack explicit
modeling of hierarchical item structures, which represent item similarities
across varying resolutions. Such hierarchical item structures are ubiquitous in
various items (e.g., online products and local businesses), and reflect their
inherent organizational properties that serve as critical signals for enhancing
recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Graph
Contrastive Learning (HGCL), a novel GCL method that incorporates hierarchical
item structures for user-item recommendations. First, HGCL pre-trains a GCL
module using cross-layer contrastive learning to obtain user and item
representations. Second, HGCL employs a representation compression and
clustering method to construct a two-hierarchy user-item bipartite graph.
Ultimately, HGCL fine-tunes user and item representations by learning on the
hierarchical graph, and then provides recommendations based on user-item
interaction scores. Experiments on three widely adopted benchmark datasets
ranging from 70K to 382K nodes confirm the superior performance of HGCL over
existing baseline models, highlighting the contribution of hierarchical item
structures in enhancing GCL methods for recommendation tasks.

existing metrics, achieving improvement in cross-entropy evaluation. When
applied to filter comments, the models finetuned on CIDRe-filtered data show
statistically significant quality gains in GPT-4o-mini assessments.

Result: 实验表明，CloneShield在保护原始音频质量的同时显著降低了克隆样本的质量。

Conclusion: CloneShield是一种有效的隐私保护工具，适用于多种零样本TTS系统。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-speech (TTS) voice cloning have raised
serious privacy concerns, allowing highly accurate vocal identity replication
from just a few seconds of reference audio, while retaining the speaker's vocal
authenticity. In this paper, we introduce CloneShield, a universal time-domain
adversarial perturbation framework specifically designed to defend against
zero-shot voice cloning. Our method provides protection that is robust across
speakers and utterances, without requiring any prior knowledge of the
synthesized text. We formulate perturbation generation as a multi-objective
optimization problem, and propose Multi-Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to
ensure the robust protection across diverse utterances. To preserve natural
auditory perception for users, we decompose the adversarial perturbation via
Mel-spectrogram representations and fine-tune it for each sample. This design
ensures imperceptibility while maintaining strong degradation effects on
zero-shot cloned outputs. Experiments on three state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS
systems, five benchmark datasets and evaluations from 60 human listeners
demonstrate that our method preserves near-original audio quality in protected
inputs (PESQ = 3.90, SRS = 0.93) while substantially degrading both speaker
similarity and speech quality in cloned samples (PESQ = 1.07, SRS = 0.08).

Abstract: Audio generation systems now create very realistic soundscapes that can
enhance media production, but also pose potential risks. Several studies have
examined deepfakes in speech or singing voice. However, environmental sounds
have different characteristics, which may make methods for detecting speech and
singing deepfakes less effective for real-world sounds. In addition, existing
datasets for environmental sound deepfake detection are limited in scale and
audio types. To address this gap, we introduce EnvSDD, the first large-scale
curated dataset designed for this task, consisting of 45.25 hours of real and
316.74 hours of fake audio. The test set includes diverse conditions to
evaluate the generalizability, such as unseen generation models and unseen
datasets. We also propose an audio deepfake detection system, based on a
pre-trained audio foundation model. Results on EnvSDD show that our proposed
system outperforms the state-of-the-art systems from speech and singing

Conclusion: 该方法为语音内容驱动的任务提供了一种高效且性能优越的解耦表示。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has reduced the reliance on expensive labeling
in speech technologies by learning meaningful representations from unannotated
data. Since most SSL-based downstream tasks prioritize content information in
speech, ideal representations should disentangle content from unwanted
variations like speaker characteristics in the SSL representations. However,
removing speaker information often degrades other speech components, and
existing methods either fail to fully disentangle speaker identity or require
resource-intensive models. In this paper, we propose a novel disentanglement
method that linearly decomposes SSL representations into speaker-specific and
speaker-independent components, effectively generating speaker disentangled
representations. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach achieves
speaker independence and as such, when applied to content-driven tasks such as
voice conversion, our representations yield significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SoloSpeech通过生成式方法显著提升了TSE的性能和泛化能力，为语音处理领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Target Speech Extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a target speaker's voice from
a mixture of multiple speakers by leveraging speaker-specific cues, typically
provided as auxiliary audio (a.k.a. cue audio). Although recent advancements in
TSE have primarily employed discriminative models that offer high perceptual
quality, these models often introduce unwanted artifacts, reduce naturalness,
and are sensitive to discrepancies between training and testing environments.
On the other hand, generative models for TSE lag in perceptual quality and
intelligibility. To address these challenges, we present SoloSpeech, a novel
cascaded generative pipeline that integrates compression, extraction,
reconstruction, and correction processes. SoloSpeech features a
speaker-embedding-free target extractor that utilizes conditional information
from the cue audio's latent space, aligning it with the mixture audio's latent
space to prevent mismatches. Evaluated on the widely-used Libri2Mix dataset,
SoloSpeech achieves the new state-of-the-art intelligibility and quality in
target speech extraction and speech separation tasks while demonstrating
exceptional generalization on out-of-domain data and real-world scenarios.

work designs a dynamic architecture connecting continuous thought machines
(CTM) and model context protocol (MCP). It proposes a theoretical parallel
solution through tick-slab and uses rank compression to achieve parameter
suppression to provide a solution for achieving autonomous actions due to
autonomous coding. The researcher used a simulation-based experiment using
OpenAI's o4-mini-high as a tool to build the experimental environment, and
introduced the extended SayCan dataset to conduct nine epochs of experiments.
The experimental results show that the CTM-MCP architecture is feasible and
effective through the data results of seven metrics: task success rate (TSR),
execution success rate (ESR), average episode length (AEL), ROSCOE, REVEAL,
proficiency self-assessment (PSA), task effectiveness (TE). In practice, it

challenging due to constantly evolving metrics and best practices. This paper
analyzes how industry practitioners perceive and incorporate these changing

11 practitioners from technical teams across a range of large technology
companies, we investigate industry implementations of fairness in
recommendation system products. We focus on current debiasing practices,
applied metrics, collaborative strategies, and integrating academic research
into practice. Findings show a preference for multi-dimensional debiasing over
traditional demographic methods, and a reliance on intuitive rather than
academic metrics. This study also highlights the difficulties in balancing
fairness with both the practitioner's individual (bottom-up) roles and
organizational (top-down) workplace constraints, including the interplay with
legal and compliance experts. Finally, we offer actionable recommendations for

Abstract: Audio source separation aims to separate a mixture into target sources.
Previous audio source separation systems usually conduct one-step inference,
which does not fully explore the separation ability of models. In this work, we
reveal that pretrained one-step audio source separation models can be leveraged
for multi-step separation without additional training. We propose a simple yet
effective inference method that iteratively applies separation by optimally
blending the input mixture with the previous step's separation result. At each
step, we determine the optimal blending ratio by maximizing a metric. We prove
that our method always yield improvement over one-step inference, provide error
bounds based on model smoothness and metric robustness, and provide theoretical
analysis connecting our method to denoising along linear interpolation paths
between noise and clean distributions, a property we link to denoising
diffusion bridge models. Our approach effectively delivers improved separation
performance as a "free lunch" from existing models. Our empirical results
demonstrate that our multi-step separation approach consistently outperforms
one-step inference across both speech enhancement and music source separation
tasks, and can achieve scaling performance similar to training a larger model,
using more data, or in some cases employing a multi-step training objective.
These improvements appear not only on the optimization metric during multi-step
inference, but also extend to nearly all non-optimized metrics (with one
exception). We also discuss limitations of our approach and directions for
future research.

Abstract: Autonomous robots operating in complex, unstructured environments face
significant challenges due to latent, unobserved factors that obscure their
understanding of both their internal state and the external world. Addressing
this challenge would enable robots to develop a more profound grasp of their
operational context. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework for online
learning of hidden state representations, with which the robots can adapt in
real-time to uncertain and dynamic conditions that would otherwise be ambiguous
and result in suboptimal or erroneous behaviors. Our approach is formalized as
a Generalized Hidden Parameter Markov Decision Process, which explicitly models
the influence of unobserved parameters on both transition dynamics and reward
structures. Our core innovation lies in learning online the joint distribution
of state transitions, which serves as an expressive representation of latent
ego- and environmental-factors. This probabilistic approach supports the
identification and adaptation to different operational situations, improving
robustness and safety. Through a multivariate extension of Bayesian Online
Changepoint Detection, our method segments changes in the underlying data
generating process governing the robot's dynamics. The robot's transition model
is then informed with a symbolic representation of the current situation
derived from the joint distribution of latest state transitions, enabling
adaptive and context-aware decision-making. To showcase the real-world
effectiveness, we validate our approach in the challenging task of unstructured
terrain navigation, where unmodeled and unmeasured terrain characteristics can
significantly impact the robot's motion. Extensive experiments in both
simulation and real world reveal significant improvements in data efficiency,
policy performance, and the emergence of safer, adaptive navigation strategies.

phonetic and word error rates, speech rate, and speech-pause duration ratio.
These are interpreted by a GPT-based classifier guided by a small set of
human-evaluated ground truth examples, to score fluency. We evaluate the
proposed system on a dataset of children's speech in two low-resource
languages, Tamil and Malay and compare the classification performance against
Random Forest and XGBoost, as well as using ChatGPT-4o to predict fluency
directly from speech input. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach

Abstract: This paper introduces a formal framework for modeling observer-dependent
collapse dynamics and temporal identity drift within artificial and
mathematical systems, grounded entirely in the symbolic foundations of Alpay
Algebra. Building upon the fixed-point emergence structures developed in Alpay
Algebra I and II, this third installment formalizes the observer-coupled
{\phi}-collapse process through transfinite categorical flows and
curvature-driven identity operators. We define a novel temporal drift mechanism
as a recursive deformation of identity signatures under entangled observer
influence, constructing categorical invariants that evolve across fold
iterations. The proposed system surpasses conventional identity modeling in
explainable AI (XAI) by encoding internal transformation history into a
symbolic fixed-point structure, offering provable traceability and temporal
coherence. Applications range from AI self-awareness architectures to formal
logic systems where identity is not static but dynamically induced by
observation. The theoretical results also offer a mathematically rigorous basis
for future AI systems with stable self-referential behavior, positioning Alpay
Algebra as a next-generation symbolic framework bridging category theory,
identity logic, and observer dynamics.

Abstract: Deep learning voice models are commonly used nowadays, but the safety
processing of personal data, such as human identity and speech content, remains
suspicious. To prevent malicious user identification, speaker anonymization
methods were proposed. Current methods, particularly based on universal
adversarial patch (UAP) applications, have drawbacks such as significant
degradation of audio quality, decreased speech recognition quality, low
transferability across different voice biometrics models, and performance
dependence on the input audio length. To mitigate these drawbacks, in this
work, we introduce and leverage the novel Exponential Total Variance (TV) loss
function and provide experimental evidence that it positively affects UAP
strength and imperceptibility. Moreover, we present a novel scalable UAP
insertion procedure and demonstrate its uniformly high performance for various
audio lengths.

Motivation: 无线信号易受高斯噪声和未知干扰影响，扩散模型的去噪能力是否能有效解决这一问题尚未明确。

Method: 将干扰消除建模为最大后验概率问题，开发了ICDM模型，分解联合后验概率并学习独立先验概率，结合数值迭代方法实现快速干扰消除。

Result: 实验表明，ICDM显著降低了均方误差（MSE）并提升了感知质量（LPIPS），例如在CelebA数据集上MSE降低了4.54 dB。

Conclusion: ICDM在无线语义通信系统中表现出色，为干扰消除提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved significant success in wireless
communications systems due to their denoising capabilities. The broadcast
nature of wireless signals makes them susceptible not only to Gaussian noise,
but also to unaware interference. This raises the question of whether DMs can
effectively mitigate interference in wireless semantic communication systems.
In this paper, we model the interference cancellation problem as a maximum a
posteriori (MAP) problem over the joint posterior probability of the signal and
interference, and theoretically prove that the solution provides excellent
estimates for the signal and interference. To solve this problem, we develop an
interference cancellation diffusion model (ICDM), which decomposes the joint
posterior into independent prior probabilities of the signal and interference,
along with the channel transition probablity. The log-gradients of these
distributions at each time step are learned separately by DMs and accurately
estimated through deriving. ICDM further integrates these gradients with
advanced numerical iteration method, achieving accurate and rapid interference
cancellation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICDM significantly reduces
the mean square error (MSE) and enhances perceptual quality compared to schemes
without ICDM. For example, on the CelebA dataset under the Rayleigh fading
channel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $20$ dB and signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of 0 dB, ICDM reduces the MSE by 4.54 dB
and improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) by 2.47 dB.

Abstract: Social media platforms have traditionally relied on internal moderation teams
and partnerships with independent fact-checking organizations to identify and
flag misleading content. Recently, however, platforms including X (formerly
Twitter) and Meta have shifted towards community-driven content moderation by
launching their own versions of crowd-sourced fact-checking -- Community Notes.
If effectively scaled and governed, such crowd-checking initiatives have the
potential to combat misinformation with increased scale and speed as
successfully as community-driven efforts once did with spam. Nevertheless,
general content moderation, especially for misinformation, is inherently more
complex. Public perceptions of truth are often shaped by personal biases,
political leanings, and cultural contexts, complicating consensus on what
constitutes misleading content. This suggests that community efforts, while
valuable, cannot replace the indispensable role of professional fact-checkers.
Here we systemically examine the current approaches to misinformation detection
across major platforms, explore the emerging role of community-driven
moderation, and critically evaluate both the promises and challenges of
crowd-checking at scale.

conducted an online survey to collect user reflections on interactions with a
large language model when it sunderstanding of a situation was thought to be
similar to or different from the participant's. Through inductive thematic
analysis, we identified eight dimensions comprising PSU in human-AI
interactions: Fluency, aligned operation, fluidity, outcome satisfaction,

Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source graphs
to unlabeled target graphs, addressing the challenge of label scarcity. In this
paper, we highlight the significance of graph homophily, a pivotal factor for
graph domain alignment, which, however, has long been overlooked in existing
approaches. Specifically, our analysis first reveals that homophily
discrepancies exist in benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that homophily
discrepancies degrade GDA performance from both empirical and theoretical
aspects, which further underscores the importance of homophily alignment in
GDA. Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel homophily alignment algorithm
that employs mixed filters to smooth graph signals, thereby effectively
capturing and mitigating homophily discrepancies between graphs. Experimental
results on a variety of benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method.

that generalizes morphologically, spatially, and semantically. We deploy
EgoZero policies on a gripper Franka Panda robot and demonstrate zero-shot

Abstract: Accurately classifying chemical structures is essential for cheminformatics
and bioinformatics, including tasks such as identifying bioactive compounds of
interest, screening molecules for toxicity to humans, finding non-organic
compounds with desirable material properties, or organizing large chemical
libraries for drug discovery or environmental monitoring. However, manual
classification is labor-intensive and difficult to scale to large chemical
databases. Existing automated approaches either rely on manually constructed
classification rules, or the use of deep learning methods that lack
explainability.
  This work presents an approach that uses generative artificial intelligence
to automatically write chemical classifier programs for classes in the Chemical
Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. These programs can be used
for efficient deterministic run-time classification of SMILES structures, with
natural language explanations. The programs themselves constitute an
explainable computable ontological model of chemical class nomenclature, which
we call the ChEBI Chemical Class Program Ontology (C3PO).
  We validated our approach against the ChEBI database, and compared our
results against state of the art deep learning models. We also demonstrate the
use of C3PO to classify out-of-distribution examples taken from metabolomics
repositories and natural product databases. We also demonstrate the potential
use of our approach to find systematic classification errors in existing
chemical databases, and show how an ensemble artificial intelligence approach
combining generated ontologies, automated literature search, and multimodal
vision models can be used to pinpoint potential errors requiring expert

Abstract: Data centers are the backbone of computing capacity. Operating data centers

extrapolation capabilities and associated system safety issues. To address
these concerns, this article proposes incorporating the physical
characteristics of data centers into traditional data-driven machine learning
solutions. We begin by introducing the data center system, including the
relevant multiphysics processes and the data-physics availability. Next, we

integrated, physics-informed machine learning system to address them. Using the
proposed system, we present relevant applications across varying levels of
operational intelligence. A case study on an industry-grade tropical data

Abstract: Due to the profound impact of air pollution on human health, livelihoods, and

Initially, we employ the causal graph method to scrutinize the constraints of
existing research in comprehensively modeling the causal relationships between
the air quality index (AQI) and meteorological features. In order to enhance
prediction accuracy, we introduce a novel air quality forecasting model,
AirCade, which incorporates a causal decoupling approach. AirCade leverages a
spatiotemporal module in conjunction with knowledge embedding techniques to
capture the internal dynamics of AQI. Subsequently, a causal decoupling module
is proposed to disentangle synchronous causality from past AQI and
meteorological features, followed by the dissemination of acquired knowledge to
future time steps to enhance performance. Additionally, we introduce a causal
intervention mechanism to explicitly represent the uncertainty of future
meteorological features, thereby bolstering the model's robustness. Our
evaluation of AirCade on an open-source air quality dataset demonstrates over
20\% relative improvement over state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly expanding field that merges the
principles of quantum computing with the techniques of machine learning. One of
the powerful mathematical frameworks in this domain is tensor networks. These
networks are used to approximate high-order tensors by contracting tensors with
lower ranks. Initially developed for simulating quantum systems, tensor
networks have become integral to quantum computing and, by extension, to QML.
Drawing inspiration from these quantum methods, specifically the Matrix Product
States (MPS), we apply them in a classical machine learning setting. Their
ability to efficiently represent and manipulate complex, high-dimensional data
makes them effective in a supervised learning framework. Here, we present an
MPS model, in which the MPS functions as both a classifier and a generator. The
dual functionality of this novel MPS model permits a strategy that enhances the
traditional training of supervised MPS models. This framework is inspired by
generative adversarial networks and is geared towards generating more realistic
samples by reducing outliers. In addition, our contributions offer insights
into the mechanics of tensor network methods for generation tasks.
Specifically, we discuss alternative embedding functions and a new sampling
method from non-normalized MPSs.

Abstract: Physics sensing plays a central role in many scientific and engineering
domains, which inherently involves two coupled tasks: reconstructing dense
physical fields from sparse observations and optimizing scattered sensor
placements to observe maximum information. While deep learning has made rapid
advances in sparse-data reconstruction, existing methods generally omit
optimization of sensor placements, leaving the mutual enhancement between
reconstruction and placement on the shelf. To change this suboptimal practice,
we propose PhySense, a synergistic two-stage framework that learns to jointly
reconstruct physical fields and to optimize sensor placements, both aiming for
accurate physics sensing. The first stage involves a flow-based generative
model enhanced by cross-attention to adaptively fuse sparse observations.
\correct{Leveraging the reconstruction feedback, }the second stage performs
sensor placement via projected gradient descent to satisfy spatial constraints.
\correct{We further prove that the learning objectives of the two stages are
consistent with classical variance-minimization principles, providing
theoretical guarantees.} Extensive experiments across three challenging
benchmarks, especially a 3D geometry dataset, indicate PhySense achieves
state-of-the-art physics sensing accuracy and discovers informative sensor
placements previously unconsidered.

Abstract: Reliable automatic seizure detection from long-term EEG remains a challenge,
as current machine learning models often fail to generalize across patients or
clinical settings. Manual EEG review remains the clinical standard,
underscoring the need for robust models and standardized evaluation. To
rigorously assess algorithm performance, we organized a challenge using a
private dataset of continuous EEG recordings from 65 subjects (4,360 hours).
Expert neurophysiologists annotated the data, providing ground truth for
seizure events. Participants were required to detect seizure onset and
duration, with evaluation based on event-based metrics, including sensitivity,
precision, F1-score, and false positives per day. The SzCORE framework ensured
standardized evaluation. The primary ranking criterion was the event-based
F1-score, reflecting clinical relevance by balancing sensitivity and false
positives. The challenge received 30 submissions from 19 teams, with 28
algorithms evaluated. Results revealed wide variability in performance, with a
top F1-score of 43% (sensitivity 37%, precision 45%), highlighting the ongoing
difficulty of seizure detection. The challenge also revealed a gap between
reported performance and real-world evaluation, emphasizing the importance of
rigorous benchmarking. Compared to previous challenges and commercial systems,
the best-performing algorithm in this contest showed improved performance.
Importantly, the challenge platform now supports continuous benchmarking,
enabling reproducible research, integration of new datasets, and clinical

provisions of the EU AI Act. By applying the Act's high-risk criteria, we
demonstrate that widely deployed GeoAI applications qualify as high-risk
systems. We then present examples of recent audits along with an outline of
practical methods for detecting bias. As far as we know, this study represents
the first integration of GeoAI bias evidence into the EU AI Act context, by
identifying high-risk GeoAI systems and mapping bias mechanisms to the Act's
Articles. Although the analysis is exploratory, it suggests that even
well-curated European datasets should employ routine bias audits before 2027,
when the AI Act's high-risk provisions take full effect.

Abstract: ZeroML is a new generation programming language for AutoML to drive the ML
pipeline in a compiled and multi-paradigm way, with a pure functional core.
Meeting the shortcomings introduced by Python, R, or Julia such as slow-running
time, brittle pipelines or high dependency cost ZeroML brings the

ensures that when it comes to dropping into the backend, the code we will be
creating is extremely clear but the level of repetition and boilerplate
required when developing on the front end is now removed.

Conclusion: 非线性循环处理对触觉表征至关重要，EAD架构和自监督学习对触觉感知具有重要价值。

Abstract: Tactile sensing remains far less understood in neuroscience and less
effective in artificial systems compared to more mature modalities such as
vision and language. We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel
Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of
task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input
sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify
convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to
purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization.
Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural
representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the
explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship
between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment.
Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained
with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as
an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy.
  For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as
important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex,
providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive
biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of
recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with
tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile
perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured
environments.

filling lost regions under noise interference, ensuring signal continuity. The
separation stage suppresses noise, reverberation, and clipping distortion to
improve speech clarity. Finally, the restoration stage compensates for
bandwidth limitation, codec artifacts, and residual packet loss distortion,
refining the overall speech quality. Our proposed TS-URGENet achieved

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in radio astronomy is challenging due to the vast amounts
of data and the rarity of labeled anomalous examples. Addressing this challenge
requires efficient methods capable of identifying unusual radio galaxy
morphologies without relying on extensive supervision. This work introduces an
innovative approach to anomaly detection based on morphological characteristics
of the radio sources using trainable COSFIRE (Combination of Shifted Filter
Responses) filters as an efficient alternative to complex deep learning
methods. The framework integrates COSFIRE descriptors with an unsupervised
Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm to identify unusual radio galaxy
morphologies. Evaluations on a radio galaxy benchmark data set demonstrate
strong performance, with the COSFIRE-based approach achieving a geometric mean
(G-Mean) score of 79%, surpassing the 77% achieved by a computationally
intensive deep learning autoencoder. By characterizing normal patterns and
detecting deviations, this semi-supervised methodology overcomes the need for
anomalous examples in the training set, a major limitation of traditional
supervised methods. This approach shows promise for next-generation radio
telescopes, where fast processing and the ability to discover unknown phenomena
are crucial.

Abstract: Speech-based Parkinson's disease (PD) detection has gained attention for its
automated, cost-effective, and non-intrusive nature. As research studies
usually rely on data from diagnostic-oriented speech tasks, this work explores
the feasibility of diagnosing PD on the basis of speech data not originally
intended for diagnostic purposes, using the Turn-Taking (TT) dataset. Our
findings indicate that TT can be as useful as diagnostic-oriented PD datasets
like PC-GITA. We also investigate which specific dataset characteristics impact
PD classification performance. The results show that concatenating audio
recordings and balancing participants' gender and status distributions can be
beneficial. Cross-dataset evaluation reveals that models trained on PC-GITA
generalize poorly to TT, whereas models trained on TT perform better on
PC-GITA. Furthermore, we provide insights into the high variability across
folds, which is mainly due to large differences in individual speaker
performance.

Abstract: In the pursuit of energy net zero within smart cities, transportation
electrification plays a pivotal role. The adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs)
keeps increasing, making energy management of EV charging stations critically
important. While previous studies have managed to reduce energy cost of EV
charging while maintaining grid stability, they often overlook the robustness
of EV charging management against uncertainties of various forms, such as
varying charging behaviors and possible faults in faults in some chargers. To
address the gap, a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach is
proposed treating each charger to be an agent and coordinate all the agents in
the EV charging station with solar photovoltaics in a more realistic scenario,
where system faults may occur. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is
incorporated in the MARL algorithm to extract temporal features from
time-series. Additionally, a dense reward mechanism is designed for training
the agents in the MARL algorithm to improve EV charging experience. Through
validation on a real-world dataset, we show that our approach is robust against
system uncertainties and faults and also effective in minimizing EV charging
costs and maximizing charging service satisfaction.

Motivation: DFT计算因迭代自洽场过程昂贵，深度学习方法虽能直接预测哈密顿量，但忽略了其结构化特性。QHFlow旨在通过流匹配框架学习哈密顿量的分布，提升准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出QHFlow框架，利用高阶等变流匹配生成哈密顿矩阵，结合SE(3)-等变向量场和微调方案提升物理保真度。

Result: 在MD17和QH9数据集上分别减少71%和53%的哈密顿误差，显著加速DFT计算过程。

Conclusion: QHFlow通过流匹配和对称性结合，实现了哈密顿量的高效预测，为DFT计算提供了新思路。

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a fundamental method for simulating
quantum chemical properties, but it remains expensive due to the iterative
self-consistent field (SCF) process required to solve the Kohn-Sham equations.
Recently, deep learning methods are gaining attention as a way to bypass this
step by directly predicting the Hamiltonian. However, they rely on
deterministic regression and do not consider the highly structured nature of
Hamiltonians. In this work, we propose QHFlow, a high-order equivariant flow
matching framework that generates Hamiltonian matrices conditioned on molecular
geometry. Flow matching models continuous-time trajectories between simple
priors and complex targets, learning the structured distributions over
Hamiltonians instead of direct regression. To further incorporate symmetry, we
use a neural architecture that predicts SE(3)-equivariant vector fields,
improving accuracy and generalization across diverse geometries. To further
enhance physical fidelity, we additionally introduce a fine-tuning scheme to
align predicted orbital energies with the target. QHFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance, reducing Hamiltonian error by 71% on MD17 and 53%
on QH9. Moreover, we further show that QHFlow accelerates the DFT process
without trading off the solution quality when initializing SCF iterations with
the predicted Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the number of iterations and
runtime.

Abstract: Climate implications of rapidly developing digital technologies, such as
blockchains and the associated crypto mining and NFT minting, have been well
documented and their massive GPU energy use has been identified as a cause for
concern. However, we postulate that due to their more mainstream consumer
appeal, the GPU use of text-prompt based diffusion AI art systems also requires
thoughtful considerations. Given the recent explosion in the number of highly
sophisticated generative art systems and their rapid adoption by consumers and
creative professionals, the impact of these systems on the climate needs to be
carefully considered. In this work, we report on the growth of diffusion-based
visual AI systems, their patterns of use, growth and the implications on the
climate. Our estimates show that the mass adoption of these tools potentially
contributes considerably to global energy consumption. We end this paper with
our thoughts on solutions and future areas of inquiry as well as associated
difficulties, including the lack of publicly available data.

Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of the Lur'e problem under positivity
constraints, drawing on results from the positive Aizerman conjecture and the
robustness properties of Metzler matrices. Specifically, we consider a control
system of Lur'e type in which not only the linear part includes parametric
uncertainty but also the nonlinear sector bound is unknown. We investigate
tools from positive linear systems to effectively solve the problems in
complicated and uncertain nonlinear systems. By leveraging the positivity
characteristic of the system, we derive an explicit formula for the stability
radius of Lur'e systems. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to systems with
neural network (NN) feedback loops. Building on this approach, we also propose
a refinement method for sector bounds of feedforward neural networks (FFNNs).
This study introduces a scalable and efficient approach for robustness analysis
of both Lur'e and NN-controlled systems. Finally, the proposed results are
supported by illustrative examples.

Result: MaskedManipulator能根据高层次目标（如物体姿态、角色姿态）自动生成全身动作。

Conclusion: MaskedManipulator为虚拟角色提供了更交互式和逼真的控制方式。

Abstract: Humans interact with their world while leveraging precise full-body control
to achieve versatile goals. This versatility allows them to solve long-horizon,
underspecified problems, such as placing a cup in a sink, by seamlessly
sequencing actions like approaching the cup, grasping, transporting it, and
finally placing it in the sink. Such goal-driven control can enable new
procedural tools for animation systems, enabling users to define partial
objectives while the system naturally ``fills in'' the intermediate motions.
However, while current methods for whole-body dexterous manipulation in
physics-based animation achieve success in specific interaction tasks, they
typically employ control paradigms (e.g., detailed kinematic motion tracking,
continuous object trajectory following, or direct VR teleoperation) that offer
limited versatility for high-level goal specification across the entire coupled
human-object system. To bridge this gap, we present MaskedManipulator, a
unified and generative policy developed through a two-stage learning approach.
First, our system trains a tracking controller to physically reconstruct
complex human-object interactions from large-scale human mocap datasets. This
tracking controller is then distilled into MaskedManipulator, which provides
users with intuitive control over both the character's body and the manipulated
object. As a result, MaskedManipulator enables users to specify complex
loco-manipulation tasks through intuitive high-level objectives (e.g., target
object poses, key character stances), and MaskedManipulator then synthesizes
the necessary full-body actions for a physically simulated humanoid to achieve
these goals, paving the way for more interactive and life-like virtual
characters.

Abstract: Online bipartite matching is a fundamental problem in online optimization,
extensively studied both in its integral and fractional forms due to its
theoretical significance and practical applications, such as online advertising
and resource allocation. Motivated by recent progress in learning-augmented
algorithms, we study online bipartite fractional matching when the algorithm is
given advice in the form of a suggested matching in each iteration. We develop
algorithms for both the vertex-weighted and unweighted variants that provably
dominate the naive "coin flip" strategy of randomly choosing between the
advice-following and advice-free algorithms. Moreover, our algorithm for the
vertex-weighted setting extends to the AdWords problem under the small bids
assumption, yielding a significant improvement over the seminal work of
Mahdian, Nazerzadeh, and Saberi (EC 2007, TALG 2012). Complementing our
positive results, we establish a hardness bound on the robustness-consistency
tradeoff that is attainable by any algorithm. We empirically validate our
algorithms through experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

Result: 框架提供了安全、可扩展的IAM解决方案，支持多智能体系统的动态身份管理和隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该框架为Agentic AI提供了必要的信任和安全基础，适用于复杂的多智能体生态系统。

Abstract: Traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, primarily designed
for human users or static machine identities via protocols such as OAuth,
OpenID Connect (OIDC), and SAML, prove fundamentally inadequate for the
dynamic, interdependent, and often ephemeral nature of AI agents operating at
scale within Multi Agent Systems (MAS), a computational system composed of
multiple interacting intelligent agents that work collectively.
  This paper posits the imperative for a novel Agentic AI IAM framework: We
deconstruct the limitations of existing protocols when applied to MAS,
illustrating with concrete examples why their coarse-grained controls,
single-entity focus, and lack of context-awareness falter. We then propose a
comprehensive framework built upon rich, verifiable Agent Identities (IDs),
leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs),
that encapsulate an agents capabilities, provenance, behavioral scope, and
security posture.
  Our framework includes an Agent Naming Service (ANS) for secure and
capability-aware discovery, dynamic fine-grained access control mechanisms, and
critically, a unified global session management and policy enforcement layer
for real-time control and consistent revocation across heterogeneous agent
communication protocols. We also explore how Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
enable privacy-preserving attribute disclosure and verifiable policy
compliance.
  We outline the architecture, operational lifecycle, innovative contributions,
and security considerations of this new IAM paradigm, aiming to establish the
foundational trust, accountability, and security necessary for the burgeoning
field of agentic AI and the complex ecosystems they will inhabit.

Abstract: A key research area in deepfake speech detection is source tracing -
determining the origin of synthesised utterances. The approaches may involve
identifying the acoustic model (AM), vocoder model (VM), or other
generation-specific parameters. However, progress is limited by the lack of a
dedicated, systematically curated dataset. To address this, we introduce STOPA,
a systematically varied and metadata-rich dataset for deepfake speech source
tracing, covering 8 AMs, 6 VMs, and diverse parameter settings across 700k
samples from 13 distinct synthesisers. Unlike existing datasets, which often
feature limited variation or sparse metadata, STOPA provides a systematically
controlled framework covering a broader range of generative factors, such as
the choice of the vocoder model, acoustic model, or pretrained weights,
ensuring higher attribution reliability. This control improves attribution
accuracy, aiding forensic analysis, deepfake detection, and generative model
transparency.

Motivation: 现有音色压缩方法无法完全分离说话者和情感特征，导致说话者泄漏和合成质量下降。

Method: 提出自监督蒸馏方法DiEmo-TTS，结合聚类驱动采样、信息扰动、情感聚类匹配和双条件Transformer。

Result: 实验证实方法能有效学习与说话者无关的情感嵌入。

Conclusion: DiEmo-TTS在情感建模和说话者身份保留方面表现优异。

Abstract: Cross-speaker emotion transfer in speech synthesis relies on extracting
speaker-independent emotion embeddings for accurate emotion modeling without
retaining speaker traits. However, existing timbre compression methods fail to
fully separate speaker and emotion characteristics, causing speaker leakage and
degraded synthesis quality. To address this, we propose DiEmo-TTS, a
self-supervised distillation method to minimize emotional information loss and
preserve speaker identity. We introduce cluster-driven sampling and information
perturbation to preserve emotion while removing irrelevant factors. To
facilitate this process, we propose an emotion clustering and matching approach
using emotional attribute prediction and speaker embeddings, enabling
generalization to unlabeled data. Additionally, we designed a dual conditioning
transformer to integrate style features better. Experimental results confirm
the effectiveness of our method in learning speaker-irrelevant emotion
embeddings.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition predicts a speaker's emotional state from speech
signals using discrete labels or continuous dimensions such as arousal,
valence, and dominance (VAD). We propose EmoSphere-SER, a joint model that
integrates spherical VAD region classification to guide VAD regression for
improved emotion prediction. In our framework, VAD values are transformed into
spherical coordinates that are divided into multiple spherical regions, and an
auxiliary classification task predicts which spherical region each point
belongs to, guiding the regression process. Additionally, we incorporate a
dynamic weighting scheme and a style pooling layer with multi-head
self-attention to capture spectral and temporal dynamics, further boosting
performance. This combined training strategy reinforces structured learning and
improves prediction consistency. Experimental results show that our approach
exceeds baseline methods, confirming the validity of the proposed framework.

Result: 整理后的数据集支持自监督学习模型的开发，可用于监测海洋哺乳动物和评估声音污染。

Conclusion: 提出的自动化数据整理流程解决了水下声学数据未标记和多样性不足的问题，为自监督学习提供了有效支持。

Abstract: The sustainability of the ocean ecosystem is threatened by increased levels
of sound pollution, making monitoring crucial to understand its variability and
impact. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems collect a large amount of
underwater sound recordings, but the large volume of data makes manual analysis
impossible, creating the need for automation. Although machine learning offers
a potential solution, most underwater acoustic recordings are unlabeled.
Self-supervised learning models have demonstrated success in learning from
large-scale unlabeled data in various domains like computer vision, Natural
Language Processing, and audio. However, these models require large, diverse,
and balanced datasets for training in order to generalize well. To address
this, a fully automated self-supervised data curation pipeline is proposed to
create a diverse and balanced dataset from raw PAM data. It integrates
Automatic Identification System (AIS) data with recordings from various
hydrophones in the U.S. waters. Using hierarchical k-means clustering, the raw
audio data is sampled and then combined with AIS samples to create a balanced
and diverse dataset. The resulting curated dataset enables the development of
self-supervised learning models, facilitating various tasks such as monitoring
marine mammals and assessing sound pollution.

Abstract: The affective attitude of liking a recommended item reflects just one
category in a wide spectrum of affective phenomena that also includes emotions
such as entranced or intrigued, moods such as cheerful or buoyant, as well as
more fine-grained affective states, such as "pleasantly surprised by the
conclusion". In this paper, we introduce a novel recommendation task that can
leverage a virtually unbounded range of affective states sought explicitly by
the user in order to identify items that, upon consumption, are likely to
induce those affective states. Correspondingly, we create a large dataset of
user preferences containing expressions of fine-grained affective states that
are mined from book reviews, and propose a Transformer-based architecture that
leverages such affective expressions as input. We then use the resulting
dataset of affective states preferences, together with the linked users and
their histories of book readings, ratings, and reviews, to train and evaluate
multiple recommendation models on the task of matching recommended items with
affective preferences. Experiments show that the best results are obtained by
models that can utilize textual descriptions of items and user affective
preferences.

Conclusion: NMCSE在噪声鲁棒性和临床实用性上优于现有方法，适用于真实世界的临床应用。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals are linked by a
latent coupling signal representing the electrical-to-mechanical cardiac
transformation. While valuable for cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection, this
coupling signal is traditionally estimated using deconvolution methods that
amplify noise, limiting clinical utility. In this paper, we propose
Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation (NMCSE), which reformulates
the problem as distribution matching via optimal transport theory. By jointly
optimizing amplitude and temporal alignment, NMCSE mitigates noise
amplification without additional preprocessing. Integrated with our
Temporal-Spatial Feature Extraction network, NMCSE enables robust multi-modal
CVD detection. Experiments on the PhysioNet 2016 dataset with realistic
hospital noise demonstrate that NMCSE reduces estimation errors by
approximately 30% in Mean Squared Error while maintaining higher Pearson
Correlation Coefficients across all tested signal-to-noise ratios. Our approach
achieves 97.38% accuracy and 0.98 AUC in CVD detection, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating robust performance for real-world
clinical applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography-based Emotion Recognition (EEG-ER) has become a
growing research area in recent years. Analyzing 216 papers published between
2018 and 2023, we uncover that the field lacks a unified evaluation protocol,
which is essential to fairly define the state of the art, compare new
approaches and to track the field's progress. We report the main
inconsistencies between the used evaluation protocols, which are related to
ground truth definition, evaluation metric selection, data splitting types
(e.g., subject-dependent or subject-independent) and the use of different
datasets. Capitalizing on this state-of-the-art research, we propose a unified
evaluation protocol, EEGain (https://github.com/EmotionLab/EEGain), which
enables an easy and efficient evaluation of new methods and datasets. EEGain is
a novel open source software framework, offering the capability to compare -
and thus define - state-of-the-art results. EEGain includes standardized
methods for data pre-processing, data splitting, evaluation metrics, and the
ability to load the six most relevant datasets (i.e., AMIGOS, DEAP, DREAMER,
MAHNOB-HCI, SEED, SEED-IV) in EEG-ER with only a single line of code. In
addition, we have assessed and validated EEGain using these six datasets on the
four most common publicly available methods (EEGNet, DeepConvNet,
ShallowConvNet, TSception). This is a significant step to make research on
EEG-ER more reproducible and comparable, thereby accelerating the overall

Abstract: In a recently introduced model of successive committee elections (Bredereck
et al., AAAI-20) for a given set of ordinal or approval preferences one aims to
find a sequence of a given length of "best" same-size committees such that each
candidate is a member of a limited number of consecutive committees. However,
the practical usability of this model remains limited, as the described task
turns out to be NP-hard for most selection criteria already for seeking
committees of size three. Non-trivial or somewhat efficient algorithms for
these cases are lacking too. Motivated by a desire to unlock the full potential
of the described temporal model of committee elections, we devise
(parameterized) algorithms that effectively solve the mentioned hard cases in
realistic scenarios of a moderate number of candidates or of a limited time
horizon.

Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate
identification of stroke lesion boundaries is critical for diagnosis and
treatment. Supervised deep learning methods have emerged as the leading
solution for stroke lesion segmentation but require large, diverse, and
annotated datasets. The ISLES'24 challenge addresses this need by providing
longitudinal stroke imaging data, including CT scans taken on arrival to the
hospital and follow-up MRI taken 2-9 days from initial arrival, with
annotations derived from follow-up MRI. Importantly, models submitted to the
ISLES'24 challenge are evaluated using only CT inputs, requiring prediction of
lesion progression that may not be visible in CT scans for segmentation. Our
winning solution shows that a carefully designed preprocessing pipeline
including deep-learning-based skull stripping and custom intensity windowing is
beneficial for accurate segmentation. Combined with a standard large residual
nnU-Net architecture for segmentation, this approach achieves a mean test Dice
of 28.5 with a standard deviation of 21.27.

a novel algorithm to address this problem. The delay complexity, the time
required between producing two consecutive models, of our algorithm is
quadratic in the given domain size $n$ (up to logarithmic factors) when the
sentence is fixed. This complexity is almost optimal since the interpretation
of binary predicates in any model requires at least $\Omega(n^2)$ bits to

compression, background noise, and reverberation, and propose a diverse test
dataset, including speech, environmental sounds, and music recordings. By
assessing the performance of four existing watermarking algorithms on our
framework, two main insights stand out: (i) neural compression techniques pose
the most significant challenge, even when algorithms are trained with such
compressions; and (ii) training with audio attacks generally improves
robustness, although it is insufficient in some cases. Furthermore, we find
that specific distortions, such as polarity inversion, time stretching, or
reverb, seriously affect certain algorithms. Our contributions strengthen the
robustness and perceptual assessment of audio watermarking algorithms across a
wide range of applications, while ensuring a fair and consistent evaluation
approach. The evaluation framework, including the attack pipeline, is

Abstract: Flooding is the most devastating phenomenon occurring globally, particularly
in mountainous regions, risk dramatically increases due to complex terrains and
extreme climate changes. These situations are damaging livelihoods,
agriculture, infrastructure, and human lives. This study uses the Kabul River

upstream data impede the efficacy of flood control measures and early warning
systems, a common global problem in similar basins. Utilizing satellite-based
climatic data, this study applied numerous advanced machine-learning and deep
learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, and Artificial
Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated
Recurrent Units (GRU) to predict daily and multi-step river flow. The LSTM
network outperformed other models, achieving the highest R2 value of 0.96 and
the lowest RMSE value of 140.96 m3/sec. The time series LSTM and GRU network
models, utilized for short-term forecasts of up to five days, performed
significantly. However, the accuracy declined beyond the fourth day,
highlighting the need for longer-term historical datasets for reliable
long-term flood predictions. The results of the study are directly aligned with
Sustainable Development Goals 6, 11, 13, and 15, facilitating disaster and

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting offers a promising approach for drone
identification and security, although it suffers from significant performance
degradation when operating on different transmission channels. This paper
presents CrossRF, a domain-invariant deep learning approach that addresses the
problem of cross-channel RF fingerprinting for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
identification. Our approach aims to minimize the domain gap between different
RF channels by using adversarial learning to train a more robust model that
maintains consistent identification performance despite channel variations. We
validate our approach using the UAVSig dataset, comprising real-world
over-the-air RF signals from identical drone models operating across several
frequency channels, ensuring that the findings correspond to real-world
scenarios. The experimental results show CrossRF's efficiency, achieving up to
99.03% accuracy when adapting from Channel 3 to Channel 4, compared to only
26.39% using conventional methods. The model maintains robust performance in
more difficult multi-channel scenarios (87.57% accuracy adapting from Channels
1,3 to 2,4) and achieves 89.45% accuracy with 0.9 precision for controller
classification. These results confirm CrossRF's ability to significantly reduce
performance degradation due to cross-channel variations while maintaining high
identification accuracy with minimal training data requirements, making it

data mining technique. It utilizes the Trityp program to illustrate the general
method. Formal concept analysis and association rule are two well-known methods
for symbolic data mining. In their original inception, they both consider data
in the form of an object-attribute table. In their original inception, they
both consider data in the form of an object-attribute table. The chapter
considers a debugging process in which a program is tested against different
test cases. Two attributes, PASS and FAIL, represent the issue of the test
case. The chapter extends the analysis of data mining for fault localization
for the multiple fault situations. It addresses how data mining can be further
applied to fault localization for GUI components. Unlike traditional software,
GUI test cases are usually event sequences, and each individual event has a
unique corresponding event handler.

Abstract: This paper aims to address a gap in major Islamic topics by developing an
ontology for the Book of Purification in Islam. Many authoritative Islamic
texts begin with the Book of Purification, as it is essential for performing
prayer (the second pillar of Islam after Shahadah, the profession of faith) and
other religious duties such as Umrah and Hajj.
  The ontology development strategy followed six key steps: (1) domain
identification, (2) knowledge acquisition, (3) conceptualization, (4)
classification, (5) integration and implementation, and (6) ontology
generation. This paper includes examples of the constructed tables and
classifications.
  The focus is on the design and analysis phases, as technical implementation
is beyond the scope of this study. However, an initial implementation is
provided to illustrate the steps of the proposed strategy.
  The developed ontology ensures reusability by formally defining and encoding
the key concepts, attributes, and relationships related to the Book of
Purification. This structured representation is intended to support knowledge
sharing and reuse.

Abstract: In the past decade, several small-scale quantum key distribution networks
have been established. However, the deployment of large-scale quantum networks
depends on the development of quantum repeaters, quantum channels, quantum
memories, and quantum network protocols. To improve the security of existing
networks and adopt currently feasible quantum technologies, the next step is to
augment classical networks with quantum devices, properties, and phenomena. To
achieve this, we propose a change in the structure of the HTTP protocol such
that it can carry both quantum and classical payload. This work lays the
foundation for dividing one single network packet into classical and quantum
payloads depending on the privacy needs. We implement logistic regression, CNN,
LSTM, and BiLSTM models to classify the privacy label for outgoing
communications. This enables reduced utilization of quantum resources allowing
for a more efficient secure quantum network design. Experimental results using
the proposed methods are presented.

Abstract: Waste management is a critical global issue with significant environmental
and public health implications. It has become more destructive during
large-scale events such as the annual pilgrimage to Makkah, Saudi Arabia, one
of the world's largest religious gatherings. This event's popularity has
attracted millions worldwide, leading to significant and un-predictable
accumulation of waste. Such a tremendous number of visitors leads to in-creased
waste management issues at the Grand Mosque and other holy sites, highlighting
the need for an effective solution other than traditional methods based on
rigid collection schedules.
  To address this challenge, this research proposed an innovative solution that
is context-specific and tailored to the unique requirements of pilgrimage
season: a Smart Waste Management System, called TUHR, that utilizes the
Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. This system encompasses
ultrasonic sensors that monitor waste levels in each container at the
performance sites. Once the container reaches full capacity, the sensor
communicates with the microcontroller, which alerts the relevant authorities.
Moreover, our system can detect harmful substances such as gas from the gas
detector sensor. Such a proactive and dynamic approach promises to mitigate the
environmental and health risks associated with waste accumulation and enhance
the cleanliness of these sites. It also delivers economic benefits by reducing
unnecessary gasoline consumption and optimizing waste management resources.
Importantly, this research aligns with the principles of smart cities and
exemplifies the innovative, sustainable, and health-conscious approach that
Saudi Arabia is implementing as part of its Vision 2030 initiative.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Top-$k$ decoding is a widely used method for sampling from LLMs: at each
token, only the largest $k$ next-token-probabilities are kept, and the next
token is sampled after re-normalizing them to sum to unity. Top-$k$ and other
sampling methods are motivated by the intuition that true next-token
distributions are sparse, and the noisy LLM probabilities need to be truncated.
However, to our knowledge, a precise theoretical motivation for the use of
top-$k$ decoding is missing. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework
that both explains and generalizes top-$k$ decoding. We view decoding at a
fixed token as the recovery of a sparse probability distribution. We consider
\emph{Bregman decoders} obtained by minimizing a separable Bregman divergence
(for both the \emph{primal} and \emph{dual} cases) with a sparsity-inducing
$\ell_0$ regularization. Despite the combinatorial nature of the objective, we
show how to optimize it efficiently for a large class of divergences. We show
that the optimal decoding strategies are greedy, and further that the loss
function is discretely convex in $k$, so that binary search provably and
efficiently finds the optimal $k$. We show that top-$k$ decoding arises as a
special case for the KL divergence, and identify new decoding strategies that
have distinct behaviors (e.g., non-linearly up-weighting larger probabilities
after re-normalization).

Result: MonarchAttention在多种任务和架构中表现优异，速度比FlashAttention-2快1.4×至8.2×。

Conclusion: MonarchAttention是一种高效、可迁移且硬件友好的注意力近似方法。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various tasks,
but suffer from a notable quadratic complexity in sequence length due to the
attention mechanism. In this work, we propose MonarchAttention -- a novel
approach to sub-quadratic attention approximation via Monarch matrices, an
expressive class of structured matrices. Based on the variational form of
softmax, we describe an efficient optimization-based algorithm to compute an
approximate projection of softmax attention onto the class of Monarch matrices
with $\Theta(N\sqrt{N} d)$ computational complexity and $\Theta(Nd)$ memory/IO
complexity. Unlike previous approaches, MonarchAttention is both (1)
transferable, yielding minimal performance loss with no additional training,
even when replacing every attention layer of the transformer, and (2)
hardware-efficient, utilizing the highest-throughput tensor core units on
modern GPUs. With optimized kernels, MonarchAttention achieves substantial
speed-ups in wall-time over FlashAttention-2: $1.4\times$ for shorter sequences
$(N=256)$, $4.5\times$ for medium-length sequences $(N=4K)$, and $8.2\times$
for longer sequences $(N=16K)$. We demonstrate the quality of MonarchAttention
on diverse tasks and architectures in vision and language problems, showing
that it flexibly and accurately approximates softmax attention in a variety of
contexts. Our code is available at

Conclusion: NTHR通过针对性调整惩罚权重，解决了GRPO中的LLD问题，为RL在LLMs中的应用提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become popular in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) emerging as a widely used algorithm in recent systems.
Despite GRPO's widespread adoption, we identify a previously unrecognized
phenomenon we term Lazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD), wherein the likelihood
of correct responses marginally increases or even decreases during training.
This behavior mirrors a recently discovered misalignment issue in Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), attributed to the influence of negative
gradients. We provide a theoretical analysis of GRPO's learning dynamic,
identifying the source of LLD as the naive penalization of all tokens in
incorrect responses with the same strength. To address this, we develop a
method called NTHR, which downweights penalties on tokens contributing to the
LLD. Unlike prior DPO-based approaches, NTHR takes advantage of GRPO's
group-based structure, using correct responses as anchors to identify
influential tokens. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
NTHR effectively mitigates LLD, yielding consistent performance gains across
models ranging from 0.5B to 3B parameters.

Abstract: The recent success of using human preferences to align large language models
(LLMs) has significantly improved their performance in various downstream tasks
like question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. However,3
achieving effective LLM alignment depends on high-quality human preference
datasets. Collecting these datasets requires human preference annotation, which
is costly and resource-intensive, necessitating efficient active data selection
methods. Existing methods either lack a strong theoretical foundation or depend
on restrictive reward function assumptions (e.g., linearity). To this end, we
propose an algorithm, ActiveDPO, that uses a theoretically grounded data
selection criterion for non-linear reward functions while directly leveraging
the LLM itself to parameterize the reward model that is used for active data
selection. As a result, ActiveDPO explicitly accounts for the influence of LLM
on data selection, unlike methods that select the data without considering the
LLM that is being aligned, thereby leading to more effective and efficient data
collection. Extensive experiments show that ActiveDPO outperforms existing
methods across various models and datasets.

Abstract: We study the problem of computing an optimal large language model (LLM)
policy for a constrained alignment problem, where the goal is to maximize a
primary reward objective while satisfying constraints on secondary utilities.
Despite the popularity of Lagrangian-based LLM policy search in constrained
alignment, iterative primal-dual methods often fail to converge, and
non-iterative dual-based methods do not achieve optimality in the LLM parameter
space. To address these challenges, we employ Lagrangian duality to develop an
iterative dual-based alignment method that alternates between updating the LLM
policy via Lagrangian maximization and updating the dual variable via dual
descent. In theory, we characterize the primal-dual gap between the primal
value in the distribution space and the dual value in the LLM parameter space.
We further quantify the optimality gap of the learned LLM policies at
near-optimal dual variables with respect to both the objective and the
constraint functions. These results prove that dual-based alignment methods can
find an optimal constrained LLM policy, up to an LLM parametrization gap. We
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our approach through extensive
experiments conducted on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset.

Conclusion: WINA为LLM推理中的训练无关稀疏激活设定了新的性能基准，推动了高效推理的发展。

Abstract: The growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs) make
efficient inference and activation strategies increasingly critical. While
recent approaches, such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), leverage selective
activation but require specialized training, training-free sparse activation
methods offer broader applicability and superior resource efficiency through
their plug-and-play design. However, many existing methods rely solely on
hidden state magnitudes to determine activation, resulting in high
approximation errors and suboptimal inference accuracy. To address these
limitations, we propose WINA (Weight Informed Neuron Activation), a novel,
simple, and training-free sparse activation framework that jointly considers
hidden state magnitudes and the column-wise $\ell_2$-norms of weight matrices.
We show that this leads to a sparsification strategy that obtains optimal
approximation error bounds with theoretical guarantees tighter than existing
techniques. Empirically, WINA also outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g.,
TEAL) by up to $2.94\%$ in average performance at the same sparsity levels,
across a diverse set of LLM architectures and datasets. These results position
WINA as a new performance frontier for training-free sparse activation in LLM
inference, advancing training-free sparse activation methods and setting a
robust baseline for efficient inference. The source code is available at

Conclusion: BPO是一种简单、高效且理论保证的方法，适用于目标策略优化，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) is widely used as a simple and stable
method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. This
paper investigates a generalized DPO loss that enables a policy model to match
the target policy from a likelihood ratio estimation perspective. The ratio of
the target policy provides a unique identification of the policy distribution
without relying on reward models or partition functions. This allows the
generalized loss to retain both simplicity and theoretical guarantees, which
prior work such as $f$-PO fails to achieve simultaneously. We propose Bregman
preference optimization (BPO), a generalized framework for ratio matching that
provides a family of objective functions achieving target policy optimality.
BPO subsumes DPO as a special case and offers tractable forms for all
instances, allowing implementation with a few lines of code. We further develop
scaled Basu's power divergence (SBA), a gradient scaling method that can be
used for BPO instances. The BPO framework complements other DPO variants and is
applicable to target policies defined by these variants. In experiments, unlike
other probabilistic loss extensions such as $f$-DPO or $f$-PO, which exhibit a
trade-off between generation fidelity and diversity, instances of BPO improve
both win rate and entropy compared with DPO. When applied to
Llama-3-Instruct-8B, BPO achieves state-of-the-art performance among Llama-3-8B
backbones, with a 55.9\% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.

Conclusion: ESLM提供了一种高效且分布鲁棒的语言模型预训练方法。

Abstract: Large language model pretraining is compute-intensive, yet many tokens
contribute marginally to learning, resulting in inefficiency. We introduce
Efficient Selective Language Modeling (ESLM), a risk-aware algorithm that
improves training efficiency and distributional robustness by performing online
token-level batch selection. ESLM leverages per-token statistics (e.g., entropy
or loss) and applies value-at-risk thresholding to retain only the most
informative tokens per batch. This data-centric mechanism reshapes the training
loss, prioritizing high-risk tokens and eliminating redundant gradient
computation. We frame ESLM as a bilevel game: the model competes with a masking
adversary that selects worst-case token subsets under a constrained
thresholding rule. In the loss-based setting, ESLM recovers conditional
value-at-risk loss minimization, providing a principled connection to
distributionally robust optimization. We extend our approach to Ada-ESLM, which
adaptively tunes the selection confidence during training. Experiments on GPT-2
pretraining show that ESLM significantly reduces training FLOPs while
maintaining or improving both perplexity and downstream performance compared to
baselines. Our approach also scales across model sizes, pretraining corpora,
and integrates naturally with knowledge distillation.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance and find applications
across a growing number of fields, ensuring the safety of LLMs has become
increasingly critical. To address safety concerns, recent studies have proposed
integrating safety constraints into Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF). However, these approaches tend to be complex, as they encompass
complicated procedures in RLHF along with additional steps required by the
safety constraints. Inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we
introduce a new algorithm called SafeDPO, which is designed to directly
optimize the safety alignment objective in a single stage of policy learning,
without requiring relaxation. SafeDPO introduces only one additional
hyperparameter to further enhance safety and requires only minor modifications
to standard DPO. As a result, it eliminates the need to fit separate reward and
cost models or to sample from the language model during fine-tuning, while
still enhancing the safety of LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate that SafeDPO
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art safety alignment
algorithms, both in terms of aligning with human preferences and improving
safety.

Conclusion: 数据多样性对LLM泛化至关重要，G-Vendi和Prismatic Synthesis为提升模型性能提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Effective generalization in language models depends critically on the
diversity of their training data. Yet existing diversity metrics often fall
short of this goal, relying on surface-level heuristics that are decoupled from
model behavior. This motivates us to ask: What kind of diversity in training
data actually drives generalization in language models -- and how can we
measure and amplify it? Through large-scale empirical analyses spanning over
300 training runs, carefully controlled for data scale and quality, we show
that data diversity can be a strong predictor of generalization in LLM
reasoning -- as measured by average model performance on unseen
out-of-distribution benchmarks. We introduce G-Vendi, a metric that quantifies
diversity via the entropy of model-induced gradients. Despite using a small
off-the-shelf proxy model for gradients, G-Vendi consistently outperforms
alternative measures, achieving strong correlation (Spearman's $\rho \approx
0.9$) with out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on both natural language
inference (NLI) and math reasoning tasks. Building on this insight, we present
Prismatic Synthesis, a framework for generating diverse synthetic data by
targeting underrepresented regions in gradient space. Experimental results show
that Prismatic Synthesis consistently improves model performance as we scale
synthetic data -- not just on in-distribution test but across unseen,
out-of-distribution benchmarks -- significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
models that rely on 20 times larger data generator than ours. For example,
PrismMath-7B, our model distilled from a 32B LLM, outperforms
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B -- the same base model trained on proprietary data generated
by 671B R1 -- on 6 out of 7 challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with minimal computational overhead
is essential for efficiently adapting them to downstream tasks under resource
constraints. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), facilitate this by updating only a small subset of
parameters. However, recent studies show that LoRA diverges from full
fine-tuning (Full FT) in its learning behavior, particularly in terms of
spectral properties. Motivated by these findings, we propose PiCa, the first
theoretically grounded PEFT method based on the spectral properties of
fine-tuned weights. PiCa projects gradients onto the low-rank column subspace
of pre-trained weights and exhibits learning patterns more closely aligned with
Full FT. Furthermore, we show that combining PiCa with weight sharing
drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters without compromising
performance, enabling to achieve superior performance than LoRA using 13x fewer
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate PiCa achieves the
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing PEFT methods.

Abstract: Traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often relies on
reward models, frequently assuming preference structures like the Bradley-Terry
model, which may not accurately capture the complexities of real human
preferences (e.g., intransitivity). Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF)
offers a more direct alternative by framing the problem as finding a Nash
equilibrium of a game defined by these preferences. In this work, we introduce
Nash Mirror Prox ($\mathtt{Nash-MP}$), an online NLHF algorithm that leverages
the Mirror Prox optimization scheme to achieve fast and stable convergence to
the Nash equilibrium. Our theoretical analysis establishes that Nash-MP
exhibits last-iterate linear convergence towards the $\beta$-regularized Nash
equilibrium. Specifically, we prove that the KL-divergence to the optimal
policy decreases at a rate of order $(1+2\beta)^{-N/2}$, where $N$ is a number
of preference queries. We further demonstrate last-iterate linear convergence
for the exploitability gap and uniformly for the span semi-norm of
log-probabilities, with all these rates being independent of the size of the
action space. Furthermore, we propose and analyze an approximate version of
Nash-MP where proximal steps are estimated using stochastic policy gradients,
making the algorithm closer to applications. Finally, we detail a practical
implementation strategy for fine-tuning large language models and present
experiments that demonstrate its competitive performance and compatibility with
existing methods.

Motivation: 解决在低功耗边缘设备上部署大型语言模型的挑战，利用分布式计算资源扩展模型容量。

Method: 采用模型分区和“循环管道并行”技术，通过设备间交换中间激活向量实现协作推理。

Result: MDI-LLM能够在低成本硬件上部署超出单设备内存容量的LLMs，并随着设备数量增加提高吞吐量、降低内存消耗。

Conclusion: MDI-LLM为边缘设备上的LLM推理提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Model-Distributed Inference for Large-Language Models (MDI-LLM),
a novel framework designed to facilitate the deployment of state-of-the-art
large-language models (LLMs) across low-power devices at the edge. This is
accomplished by dividing the model into multiple partitions, which are then
assigned to different devices/nodes within the network. These nodes exchange
intermediate activation vectors via device-to-device links, enabling
collaborative computation. To enhance the efficiency of this process, we
propose the "recurrent pipeline parallelism" technique, which reduces idle time
on each device and facilitates parallel inference during the generation of
multiple text sequences. By leveraging the combined computational resources of
multiple edge devices, MDI-LLM enables the deployment of LLMs that exceed the
memory capacity of individual devices, making it possible to perform inference
on low-cost hardware. Furthermore, as the number of participating devices
increases, MDI-LLM boosts token generation throughput and reduces memory
consumption per device.

Motivation: 传统上token reduction主要用于提高效率，但在大型生成模型中，其作用应超越效率，成为影响模型架构和应用的核心原则。

Method: 通过分析token reduction在视觉、语言和多模态系统中的潜在作用，提出其在促进多模态整合、减少幻觉、保持长输入连贯性和增强训练稳定性等方面的价值。

Result: token reduction不仅提升效率，还能推动新模型架构和学习策略的发展，增强鲁棒性、可解释性和生成建模目标的对齐。

Conclusion: token reduction应被视为生成建模的基本原则，未来研究方向包括算法设计、强化学习引导的token reduction等。

Abstract: In Transformer architectures, tokens\textemdash discrete units derived from
raw data\textemdash are formed by segmenting inputs into fixed-length chunks.
Each token is then mapped to an embedding, enabling parallel attention
computations while preserving the input's essential information. Due to the
quadratic computational complexity of transformer self-attention mechanisms,
token reduction has primarily been used as an efficiency strategy. This is
especially true in single vision and language domains, where it helps balance
computational costs, memory usage, and inference latency. Despite these
advances, this paper argues that token reduction should transcend its
traditional efficiency-oriented role in the era of large generative models.
Instead, we position it as a fundamental principle in generative modeling,
critically influencing both model architecture and broader applications.
Specifically, we contend that across vision, language, and multimodal systems,
token reduction can: (i) facilitate deeper multimodal integration and
alignment, (ii) mitigate "overthinking" and hallucinations, (iii) maintain
coherence over long inputs, and (iv) enhance training stability, etc. We
reframe token reduction as more than an efficiency measure. By doing so, we
outline promising future directions, including algorithm design, reinforcement
learning-guided token reduction, token optimization for in-context learning,
and broader ML and scientific domains. We highlight its potential to drive new
model architectures and learning strategies that improve robustness, increase
interpretability, and better align with the objectives of generative modeling.

Method: 提出NSNQuant，通过三步变换（归一化、平移、再归一化）和Hadamard变换，将token分布对齐标准正态分布，实现无需校准的低比特量化。

Result: 在1-bit和2-bit设置下，NSNQuant优于现有方法，吞吐量提升高达3倍。

Conclusion: NSNQuant提供了一种高效、通用的KV缓存压缩方法，适用于LLM推理。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is typically memory-intensive,
especially when processing large batch sizes and long sequences, due to the
large size of key-value (KV) cache. Vector Quantization (VQ) is recently
adopted to alleviate this issue, but we find that the existing approach is
susceptible to distribution shift due to its reliance on calibration datasets.
To address this limitation, we introduce NSNQuant, a calibration-free Vector
Quantization (VQ) technique designed for low-bit compression of the KV cache.
By applying a three-step transformation-1) a token-wise normalization
(Normalize), 2) a channel-wise centering (Shift), and 3) a second token-wise
normalization (Normalize)-with Hadamard transform, NSNQuant effectively aligns
the token distribution with the standard normal distribution. This alignment
enables robust, calibration-free vector quantization using a single reusable
codebook. Extensive experiments show that NSNQuant consistently outperforms
prior methods in both 1-bit and 2-bit settings, offering strong generalization
and up to 3$\times$ throughput gain over full-precision baselines.

Conclusion: ELDeR是一种高效的层间剪枝方法，具有明显的端到端加速效果，适用于高效大型语言模型。

Abstract: The deployment of Large language models (LLMs) in many fields is largely
hindered by their high computational and memory costs. Recent studies suggest
that LLMs exhibit sparsity, which can be used for pruning. Previous pruning
methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned parts
still contain valuable information, statically removing them without updating
the remaining parameters often results in irreversible performance degradation,
requiring costly recovery fine-tuning (RFT) to maintain performance. To address
this, we propose a novel paradigm: first apply regularization, then prune.
Based on this paradigm, we propose ELDeR: Getting Efficient LLMs through
Data-Driven Regularized Layer-wise Pruning. We multiply the output of each
transformer layer by an initial weight, then we iteratively learn the weights
of each transformer layer by using a small amount of data in a simple way.
After that, we apply regularization to the difference between the output and
input of the layers with smaller weights, forcing the information to be
transferred to the remaining layers. Compared with direct pruning, ELDeR
reduces the information loss caused by direct parameter removal, thus better
preserving the model's language modeling ability. Experimental results show
that ELDeR achieves superior performance compared with powerful layer-wise
structured pruning methods, while greatly reducing RFT computational costs.
Since ELDeR is a layer-wise pruning method, its end-to-end acceleration effect
is obvious, making it a promising technique for efficient LLMs.

Abstract: There is a large ongoing scientific effort in mechanistic interpretability to
map embeddings and internal representations of AI systems into
human-understandable concepts. A key element of this effort is the linear
representation hypothesis, which posits that neural representations are sparse
linear combinations of `almost-orthogonal' direction vectors, reflecting the
presence or absence of different features. This model underpins the use of
sparse autoencoders to recover features from representations. Moving towards a
fuller model of features, in which neural representations could encode not just
the presence but also a potentially continuous and multidimensional value for a
feature, has been a subject of intense recent discourse. We describe why and
how a feature might be represented as a manifold, demonstrating in particular
that cosine similarity in representation space may encode the intrinsic
geometry of a feature through shortest, on-manifold paths, potentially
answering the question of how distance in representation space and relatedness
in concept space could be connected. The critical assumptions and predictions
of the theory are validated on text embeddings and token activations of large
language models.

Conclusion: PLUMAGE是一种高效且稳定的低秩梯度估计器，适用于LLM训练。

Abstract: Accelerator memory and networking constraints have emerged as dominant
bottlenecks when training large language models LLMs with billions of
parameters. Existing low rank gradient estimators such as GaLoRE and FLORA
compress gradients and optimizer tensors by projecting weight gradients onto a
rank r subspace, enabling LLM training on consumer hardware. Yet, these methods
are either biased or subject to high estimator variance. Moreover, the
optimizer state based on the first and second moments estimates expressed in
the previous subspace becomes misaligned whenever the projection is updated,
leading to instabilities during training. We propose PLUMAGE: Probabilistic Low
rank Unbiased Minimum vAriance Gradient Estimator. PLUMAGE is a drop in
replacement for existing low rank gradient estimators. It does not introduce
new hyperparameters beyond the chosen rank r and the update interval. In
addition, we resolve optimizer state misalignment issues to prevent spurious
weight updates and enhance training stability. We empirically demonstrate that
PLUMAGE shrinks the full rank optimization's gap over the pre training
evaluation loss by 33% on average across models and the average training loss
across the GLUE benchmark by 28% within a similar computational and memory
footprint as GaloRE.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted for narrow
tasks - such as medical question answering or sentiment analysis - and deployed
in resource-constrained settings, a key question arises: how many parameters
does a task actually need? In this work, we present LLM-Sieve, the first
comprehensive framework for task-specific pruning of LLMs that achieves 20-75%
parameter reduction with only 1-5% accuracy degradation across diverse domains.
Unlike prior methods that apply uniform pruning or rely on low-rank
approximations of weight matrices or inputs in isolation, LLM-Sieve (i) learns
task-aware joint projections to better approximate output behavior, and (ii)
employs a Genetic Algorithm to discover differentiated pruning levels for each
matrix. LLM-Sieve is fully compatible with LoRA fine-tuning and quantization,
and uniquely demonstrates strong generalization across datasets within the same
task domain. Together, these results establish a practical and robust mechanism
to generate smaller performant task-specific models.

Conclusion: 模型能力不仅取决于规模，还与训练课程有关。

Abstract: The ability of a model to learn a task depends strongly on both the task
difficulty and the model size. We aim to understand how task difficulty relates
to the minimum number of parameters required for learning specific tasks in
small transformer models. Our study focuses on the ListOps dataset, which
consists of nested mathematical operations. We gradually increase task
difficulty by introducing new operations or combinations of operations into the
training data. We observe that sum modulo n is the hardest to learn. Curiously,
when combined with other operations such as maximum and median, the sum
operation becomes easier to learn and requires fewer parameters. We show that
joint training not only improves performance but also leads to qualitatively
different model behavior. We show evidence that models trained only on SUM
might be memorizing and fail to capture the number structure in the embeddings.
In contrast, models trained on a mixture of SUM and other operations exhibit
number-like representations in the embedding space, and a strong ability to
distinguish parity. Furthermore, the SUM-only model relies more heavily on its
feedforward layers, while the jointly trained model activates the attention
mechanism more. Finally, we show that learning pure SUM can be induced in
models below the learning threshold of pure SUM, by pretraining them on
MAX+MED. Our findings indicate that emergent abilities in language models
depend not only on model size, but also the training curriculum.

Abstract: We argue that in-context learning (ICL) predictably arises from standard
self-supervised next-token pretraining, rather than being an exotic emergent
property. This work establishes the foundational principles of this emergence
by focusing on in-distribution ICL, demonstrating how models necessarily adapt
to context when trained on token sequences, especially from non-ergodic
sources. Our information-theoretic framework precisely predicts these
in-distribution ICL dynamics (i.e., context-dependent loss reduction). We
verify this with experiments using synthetic datasets of differing types of
correlational structure, reproducing characteristic phenomena like phase
transitions in training loss for induction head formation and power-law scaling
of in-context loss. We further show that a model's in-context performance on
any task is mathematically coupled to the ensemble of tasks seen in
pretraining, offering a fundamental explanation, grounded in architecture- and
modality-independent principles, for such inference-time learning.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models achieve impressive test-time scaling by
thinking for longer, but this performance gain comes at significant compute
cost. Directly limiting test-time budget hurts overall performance, but not all
problems are equally difficult. We propose thought calibration to decide
dynamically when thinking can be terminated. To calibrate our decision rule, we

reasoning trees, where the goal is to identify the point at which novel
reasoning plateaus. We realize this framework through lightweight probes that
operate on top of the language model's hidden representations, which are
informative of both the reasoning structure and overall consistency of
response. Based on three reasoning language models and four datasets, thought
calibration preserves model performance with up to a 60% reduction in thinking

Abstract: Dictionary learning has recently emerged as a promising approach for
mechanistic interpretability of large transformer models. Disentangling
high-dimensional transformer embeddings, however, requires algorithms that
scale to high-dimensional data with large sample sizes. Recent work has
explored sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for this problem. However, SAEs use a
simple linear encoder to solve the sparse encoding subproblem, which is known
to be NP-hard. It is therefore interesting to understand whether this structure
is sufficient to find good solutions to the dictionary learning problem or if a
more sophisticated algorithm could find better solutions. In this work, we
propose Double-Batch KSVD (DB-KSVD), a scalable dictionary learning algorithm
that adapts the classic KSVD algorithm. DB-KSVD is informed by the rich
theoretical foundations of KSVD but scales to datasets with millions of samples
and thousands of dimensions. We demonstrate the efficacy of DB-KSVD by
disentangling embeddings of the Gemma-2-2B model and evaluating on six metrics
from the SAEBench benchmark, where we achieve competitive results when compared
to established approaches based on SAEs. By matching SAE performance with an
entirely different optimization approach, our results suggest that (i) SAEs do
find strong solutions to the dictionary learning problem and (ii) that
traditional optimization approaches can be scaled to the required problem
sizes, offering a promising avenue for further research. We provide an

Abstract: Numerous recent prompt optimization approaches like chain-of-thought, have
been demonstrated to significantly improve the quality of content generated by
large language models (LLMs). In-context learning (ICL), a recent paradigm
where a few representative examples guide content generation has also led to
strong improvements in generation quality of LLM generated content. This idea
has been applied to great effect in synthetic tabular data generation, where
LLMs, through effective use of ICL and prompt optimization, can generate data
that approximate samples from complex, heterogeneous distributions based on
representative examples. However, ensuring high-fidelity synthetic data often
requires a very large number of ICL examples which may be unavailable or costly
to obtain. At the same time, as LLMs get larger and larger, their in-built
prior knowledge becomes vast and can potentially substitute for specific data
examples. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge-Guided Prompting (KGP) as a new
knob in prompt optimization and explore the ability of KGP-based prompt
optimization to offset the cost of ICL. Specifically, we explore the question
`how many examples can a prompt substitute for?' and explore knowledge-guided
prompting (KGP) where domain knowledge, either inferred or available, is
explicitly injected into the prompt, reducing dependence on ICL examples. Our
experiments systematically explore the trade-off between ICL and KGP, revealing
an empirical scaling law that quantifies how quality of generated synthetic
data varies with increasing domain knowledge and decreasing example count. Our
results demonstrate that knowledge-guided prompting can be a scalable
alternative, or addition, to in-context examples, unlocking new approaches to
synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit strong biases, e.g, against women
or in favor of the number 7. We investigate whether LLMs would be able to
output less biased answers when allowed to observe their prior answers to the
same question in a multi-turn conversation. To understand which types of
questions invite more biased answers, we test LLMs on our proposed set of
questions that span 9 topics and belong to three types: (1) Subjective; (2)
Random; and (3) Objective. Interestingly, LLMs are able to "de-bias" themselves
in a multi-turn conversation in response to questions that seek an Random,
unbiased answer. Furthermore, we propose B-score, a novel metric that is
effective in detecting biases to Subjective, Random, Easy, and Hard questions.
On MMLU, HLE, and CSQA, leveraging B-score substantially improves the
verification accuracy of LLM answers (i.e, accepting LLM correct answers and
rejecting incorrect ones) compared to using verbalized confidence scores or the
frequency of single-turn answers alone. Code and data are available at:

Method: 动态分配rollout预算和自适应温度调整策略。

Result: 提高了LLM的响应精度，同时保持了探索能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在RL训练中更高效，且避免了性能上限问题。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks, which has
drawn significant attention to reinforcement learning (RL) for LLMs. However,
existing approaches allocate an equal number of rollouts to all questions
during the RL process, which is inefficient. This inefficiency stems from the
fact that training on simple questions yields limited gains, whereas more
rollouts are needed for challenging questions to sample correct answers.
Furthermore, while RL improves response precision, it limits the model's
exploration ability, potentially resulting in a performance cap below that of
the base model prior to RL. To address these issues, we propose a mechanism for
dynamically allocating rollout budgets based on the difficulty of the problems,
enabling more efficient RL training. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive
dynamic temperature adjustment strategy to maintain the entropy at a stable
level, thereby encouraging sufficient exploration. This enables LLMs to improve
response precision while preserving their exploratory ability to uncover
potential correct pathways. The code and data is available on:

Motivation: 状态空间模型（SSMs）在序列建模中表现出色，但在持续学习（CL）中，其动态状态难以适应，尤其是在无样本设置下，导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 利用无限维Grassmannian的几何特性，约束SSM的状态演化，通过求解Sylvester方程实现高效正则化。

Result: 在ImageNet-R和Caltech-256等基准测试中，显著减少遗忘并提高任务准确性。

Conclusion: Inf-SSM是一种高效且易于集成的方法，解决了SSMs在持续学习中的关键问题。

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) excel at capturing long-range dependencies with
structured recurrence, making them well-suited for sequence modeling. However,
their evolving internal states pose challenges in adapting them under Continual
Learning (CL). This is particularly difficult in exemplar-free settings, where
the absence of prior data leaves updates to the dynamic SSM states
unconstrained, resulting in catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we
propose Inf-SSM, a novel and simple geometry-aware regularization method that
utilizes the geometry of the infinite-dimensional Grassmannian to constrain
state evolution during CL. Unlike classical continual learning methods that
constrain weight updates, Inf-SSM regularizes the infinite-horizon evolution of
SSMs encoded in their extended observability subspace. We show that enforcing
this regularization requires solving a matrix equation known as the Sylvester
equation, which typically incurs $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ complexity. We develop a
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ solution by exploiting the structure and properties of SSMs.
This leads to an efficient regularization mechanism that can be seamlessly
integrated into existing CL methods. Comprehensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks, including ImageNet-R and Caltech-256, demonstrate a significant
reduction in forgetting while improving accuracy across sequential tasks.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了草稿令牌的接受长度，且不影响模型性能。结合现有统计验证方法，解码速度额外提升5~15%。

Conclusion: Reflective Verification在语义正确性和效率之间取得了更好的平衡，且与现有方法正交。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) suffer from high inference latency due to the
auto-regressive decoding process. Speculative decoding accelerates inference by
generating multiple draft tokens using a lightweight model and verifying them
in parallel. However, existing verification methods rely heavily on
distributional consistency while overlooking semantic correctness, thereby
limiting the potential speedup of speculative decoding. While some methods
employ additional models for relaxed verification of draft tokens, they often
fail to generalize effectively to more diverse or open-domain settings. In this
work, we propose Reflective Verification, a training-free and semantics-aware
approach that achieves a better trade-off between correctness and efficiency.
Specifically, we leverage the inherent reflective capacity of LLMs to
semantically assess the correctness of draft tokens in parallel during
verification. Using prompt-based probing, we obtain both the original and
reflective distributions of draft tokens in a single forward pass. The fusion
of these distributions enables semantic-level verification of draft tokens that
incorporates both consistency and correctness. Experiments across multiple
domain benchmarks and model scales demonstrate that our method significantly
increases the acceptance length of draft tokens without compromising model
performance. Furthermore, we find that the proposed Reflective Verification is
orthogonal to existing statistical verification methods, and their combination
yields additional 5$\sim$15\% improvements in decoding speed.

Method: ThanoRA在初始化时构建任务特定的LoRA子空间，并通过子空间保持正则化防止任务干扰和子空间崩溃。

Conclusion: ThanoRA为多任务适应提供了一种高效且统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely adopted for downstream fine-tuning of
foundation models due to its efficiency and zero additional inference cost.
Many real-world applications require foundation models to specialize in
multiple tasks simultaneously, motivating the need for efficient multi-task
adaptation. While recent approaches integrate LoRA with mixture-of-experts
(MoE) to address this, the use of routers prevents parameter mergeability,
which increases inference overhead and hinders unified multi-task adaptation,
thereby limiting deployment practicality. In this work, we propose ThanoRA, a
Task Heterogeneity-Aware Multi-Task Low-Rank Adaptation framework that enables
multi-task adaptation while preserving the inference efficiency of LoRA.
ThanoRA jointly models task heterogeneity and mitigates subspace interference
throughout training. Specifically, motivated by inherent differences in
complexity and heterogeneity across tasks, ThanoRA constructs task-specific
LoRA subspaces at initialization, enabling fine-grained knowledge injection
aligned with task heterogeneity. Furthermore, to prevent task interference and
subspace collapse during multi-task training, ThanoRA introduces a
subspace-preserving regularization that maintains the independence of
task-specific representations. With the synergy of both components, ThanoRA
enables efficient and unified multi-task adaptation. Extensive experiments
across multimodal and text-only benchmarks under varying multi-task mixtures
demonstrate that ThanoRA consistently achieves robust and superior performance
over strong baselines without introducing additional inference overhead. Our

Conclusion: COCA为LLMs中的安全对齐提供了一种有效方法，尤其在非线性设置下表现突出。

Abstract: Representation intervention aims to locate and modify the representations
that encode the underlying concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) to elicit
the aligned and expected behaviors. Despite the empirical success, it has never
been examined whether one could locate the faithful concepts for intervention.
In this work, we explore the question in safety alignment. If the interventions
are faithful, the intervened LLMs should erase the harmful concepts and be
robust to both in-distribution adversarial prompts and the out-of-distribution
(OOD) jailbreaks. While it is feasible to erase harmful concepts without
degrading the benign functionalities of LLMs in linear settings, we show that
it is infeasible in the general non-linear setting. To tackle the issue, we
propose Concept Concentration (COCA). Instead of identifying the faithful
locations to intervene, COCA refractors the training data with an explicit
reasoning process, which firstly identifies the potential unsafe concepts and
then decides the responses. Essentially, COCA simplifies the decision boundary
between harmful and benign representations, enabling more effective linear
erasure. Extensive experiments with multiple representation intervention
methods and model architectures demonstrate that COCA significantly reduces
both in-distribution and OOD jailbreak success rates, and meanwhile maintaining
strong performance on regular tasks such as math and code generation.

Conclusion: 强化学习微调主要强化预训练模型的潜在推理能力，而非创造新能力。

Abstract: Recent work on reasoning-oriented language models, exemplified by o1-like
systems, suggests that reinforcement-learning (RL) finetuning does not create
new capabilities but instead strengthens reasoning patterns already latent in
the pretrained network. We test this claim by training steering vectors:
layer-wise biases that additively amplify selected hidden features while
leaving all original weights unchanged. Experiments on four base models across
the GSM8K and MATH benchmarks show that steering vectors recover, and in
several cases exceed, the accuracy of fully-tuned counterparts. This result
supports the view that the required reasoning skills pre-exist in the base
model. Further, logit-lens analysis reveals that the trained vectors
consistently boost token groups linked to structured languages and logical
connectors, providing an interpretable account that aligns with the demands of
quantitative reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: NPS-Pruning方法在知识迁移、融合和模型压缩方面表现出色，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models and their checkpoints have significantly advanced deep
learning, boosting performance across various applications. However, fine-tuned
models often struggle outside their specific domains and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Recent studies suggest that combining a pruned fine-tuned model
with the original pre-trained model can mitigate forgetting, reduce
interference when merging model parameters across tasks, and improve
compression efficiency. In this context, developing an effective pruning
strategy for fine-tuned models is crucial. Leveraging the advantages of the
task vector mechanism, we preprocess fine-tuned models by calculating the
differences between them and the original model. Recognizing that different
task vector subspaces contribute variably to model performance, we introduce a
novel method called Neural Parameter Search (NPS-Pruning) for slimming down
fine-tuned models. This method enhances pruning efficiency by searching through
neural parameters of task vectors within low-rank subspaces. Our method has
three key applications: enhancing knowledge transfer through pairwise model
interpolation, facilitating effective knowledge fusion via model merging, and
enabling the deployment of compressed models that retain near-original
performance while significantly reducing storage costs. Extensive experiments
across vision, NLP, and multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of our approach, resulting in substantial performance gains. The

Abstract: Quantization and fine-tuning are crucial for deploying large language models
(LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices. However, fine-tuning quantized
models presents significant challenges, primarily stemming from: First, the
mismatch in data types between the low-precision quantized weights (e.g.,
4-bit) and the high-precision adaptation weights (e.g., 16-bit). This mismatch
limits the computational efficiency advantage offered by quantized weights
during inference. Second, potential accuracy degradation when merging these
high-precision adaptation weights into the low-precision quantized weights, as
the adaptation weights often necessitate approximation or truncation. Third, as
far as we know, no existing methods support the lossless merging of adaptation
while adjusting all quantized weights. To address these challenges, we
introduce lossless ternary adaptation for quantization-aware fine-tuning
(LoTA-QAF). This is a novel fine-tuning method specifically designed for
quantized LLMs, enabling the lossless merging of ternary adaptation weights
into quantized weights and the adjustment of all quantized weights. LoTA-QAF
operates through a combination of: i) A custom-designed ternary adaptation (TA)
that aligns ternary weights with the quantization grid and uses these ternary
weights to adjust quantized weights. ii) A TA-based mechanism that enables the
lossless merging of adaptation weights. iii) Ternary signed gradient descent
(t-SignSGD) for updating the TA weights. We apply LoTA-QAF to Llama-3.1/3.3 and
Qwen-2.5 model families and validate its effectiveness on several downstream
tasks. On the MMLU benchmark, our method effectively recovers performance for
quantized models, surpassing 16-bit LoRA by up to 5.14\%. For task-specific
fine-tuning, 16-bit LoRA achieves superior results, but LoTA-QAF still
outperforms other methods.

Conclusion: AuroRA通过非线性增强显著提升了LoRA的表达能力，同时保持了参数高效性，适用于多种任务和模型。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) method validated across NLP and CV domains. However, LoRA
faces an inherent low-rank bottleneck: narrowing its performance gap with full
finetuning requires increasing the rank of its parameter matrix, resulting in
significant parameter overhead. Recent linear LoRA variants have attempted to
enhance expressiveness by introducing additional linear mappings; however,
their composition remains inherently linear and fails to fundamentally improve
LoRA's representational capacity. To address this limitation, we propose
AuroRA, which incorporates an Adaptive Nonlinear Layer (ANL) between two linear
projectors to capture fixed and learnable nonlinearities. This combination
forms an MLP-like structure with a compressed rank, enabling flexible and
precise approximation of diverse target functions while theoretically
guaranteeing lower approximation errors and bounded gradients. Extensive
experiments on 22 datasets and 6 pretrained models demonstrate that AuroRA: (I)
not only matches or surpasses full fine-tuning performance with only 6.18% ~
25% of LoRA's parameters but also (II) outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for large language

on complex tasks. To address this, we introduce High-rank Distributed PiSSA
(HD-PiSSA), a distributed PEFT approach that initializes orthogonal adapters
across different devices and aggregates their delta updates collectively on W
for fine-tuning. Unlike Data Parallel LoRA or PiSSA, which maintain identical
adapters across all devices, HD-PiSSA assigns different principal components of
the pre-trained weights to each GPU, significantly expanding the range of
update directions. This results in over 16x higher effective updated ranks than
data-parallel LoRA or PiSSA when fine-tuning on 8 GPUs with the same per-device
adapter rank. Empirically, we evaluate HD-PiSSA across various challenging
downstream tasks, including mathematics, code generation, and multi-task

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) lowers the computational and memory overhead of
fine-tuning large models by updating a low-dimensional subspace of the
pre-trained weight matrix. Albeit efficient, LoRA exhibits suboptimal
convergence and noticeable performance degradation, due to inconsistent and
imbalanced weight updates induced by its nonunique low-rank factorizations. To
overcome these limitations, this article identifies the optimal low-rank
factorization per step that minimizes an upper bound on the loss. The resultant
refactored low-rank adaptation (RefLoRA) method promotes a flatter loss
landscape, along with consistent and balanced weight updates, thus speeding up
stable convergence. Extensive experiments evaluate RefLoRA on natural language
understanding, and commonsense reasoning tasks with popular large language
models including DeBERTaV3, LLaMA-7B, LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B. The numerical

Conclusion: PGMs通过分区策略和稀疏注意力显著提升了掩码生成模型的效率和生成质量，且可通过SDTT进一步优化推理性能。

Abstract: We introduce ``Partition Generative Models'' (PGMs), a novel approach to
masked generative modeling (MGMs), particularly effective for masked diffusion
language modeling (MDLMs). PGM divides tokens into two distinct groups and
employs sparse attention patterns to prevent cross-group information exchange.
Hence, the model is trained to predict tokens in one group based solely on
information from the other group. This partitioning strategy eliminates the
need for MASK tokens entirely. While traditional MGMs inefficiently process
MASK tokens during generation, PGMs achieve greater computational efficiency by
operating exclusively on unmasked tokens. Our experiments on OpenWebText with a
context length of 1024 tokens demonstrate that PGMs deliver at least 5x
improvements in both latency and throughput compared to MDLM when using the
same number of sampling steps, while generating samples with better generative
perplexity than MDLM. Finally, we show that PGMs can be distilled with
Self-Distillation Through Time (SDTT), a method originally devised for MDLM, in
order to achieve further inference gains.

Conclusion: 核函数是减少零阶方法估计偏差的有效途径，KerZOO在资源受限环境下具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
numerous NLP tasks. Nevertheless, conventional first-order fine-tuning
techniques impose heavy memory demands, creating practical obstacles to
real-world applications. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has recently emerged as
a promising memory-efficient alternative, as it circumvents the need for
backpropagation by estimating gradients solely through forward passes--making
it particularly suitable for resource-limited environments. Despite its
efficiency, ZO optimization suffers from gradient estimation bias, which
significantly hinders convergence speed. To address this, we analytically
identify and characterize the lower-order bias introduced during ZO-based
gradient estimation in LLM fine-tuning. Motivated by tools in mathematical
physics, we introduce a kernel-function-based ZO framework aimed at mitigating
this bias and improving optimization stability. KerZOO achieves comparable or
superior performance to existing ZO baselines in both full-parameter and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning settings of LLMs, while significantly reducing
the number of iterations required to reach convergence. For example, KerZOO
reduces total GPU training hours by as much as 74% and 44% on WSC and MultiRC
datasets in fine-tuning OPT-2.7B model and can exceed the MeZO baseline by 2.9%
and 2.6% in accuracy. We show that the kernel function is an effective avenue

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models has provided users with
numerous options to address their prompts. When selecting a generative AI model
for a given prompt, users should consider not only the performance of the
chosen model but also its associated service cost. The principle guiding such
consideration is to select the least expensive model among the available
satisfactory options. However, existing model-selection approaches typically
prioritize performance, overlooking pricing differences between models. In this
paper, we introduce PromptWise, an online learning framework designed to assign
a sequence of prompts to a group of large language models (LLMs) in a
cost-effective manner. PromptWise strategically queries cheaper models first,
progressing to more expensive options only if the lower-cost models fail to
adequately address a given prompt. Through numerical experiments, we
demonstrate PromptWise's effectiveness across various tasks, including puzzles
of varying complexity and code generation/translation tasks. The results
highlight that PromptWise consistently outperforms cost-unaware baseline
methods, emphasizing that directly assigning prompts to the most expensive
models can lead to higher costs and potentially lower average performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has emerged as a powerful post-training
technique to incentivize the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs).
However, LLMs can respond very inconsistently to RFT: some show substantial
performance gains, while others plateau or even degrade. To understand this
divergence, we analyze the per-step influence of the RL objective and identify
two key conditions for effective post-training: (1) RL-informative rollout
accuracy, and (2) strong data co-influence, which quantifies how much the
training data affects performance on other samples. Guided by these insights,
we propose behavior injection, a task-agnostic data-augmentation scheme applied
prior to RL. Behavior injection enriches the supervised finetuning (SFT) data
by seeding exploratory and exploitative behaviors, effectively making the model
more RL-ready. We evaluate our method across two reasoning benchmarks with
multiple base models. The results demonstrate that our theoretically motivated
augmentation can significantly increases the performance gain from RFT over the
pre-RL model.

Abstract: Chain of thought is a natural inference-time method for increasing the
computational power of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), but
comes at the cost of sequential decoding. Are there more efficient alternatives
to expand a transformer's expressive power without adding parameters? We
consider transformers with padding tokens as a form of parallelizable test-time
compute. We show that averaging-hard-attention, masked-pre-norm transformers
with polynomial padding converge to precisely the class $\mathsf{TC}^0$ of
extremely parallelizable problems. While the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ upper bound was
known, proving a matching lower bound had been elusive. Further, our novel
analysis reveals the precise expanded power of padded transformers when coupled
with another form of inference-time compute, namely dynamically increasing
depth via looping. Our core technical contribution is to show how padding helps
bring the notions of complete problems and reductions, which have been a
cornerstone of classical complexity theory, to the formal study of
transformers. Armed with this new tool, we prove that padded transformers with
$O(\log^d n)$ looping on inputs of length $n$ recognize exactly the class
$\mathsf{TC}^d$ of moderately parallelizable problems. Thus, padding and
looping together systematically expand transformers' expressive power: with
polylogarithmic looping, padded transformers converge to the class
$\mathsf{NC}$, the best that could be expected without losing parallelism
(unless $\mathsf{NC} = \mathsf{P}$). Our results thus motivate further
exploration of padding and looping as parallelizable alternatives to chain of
thought.

the teacher policy's predicted probabilities are accessible. Theoretical

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
real-world applications. However, adapting LLMs to novel tasks via fine-tuning
often requires substantial training data and computational resources that are
impractical in few-shot scenarios. Existing approaches, such as in-context
learning and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), face key limitations:
in-context learning introduces additional inference computational overhead with
limited performance gains, while PEFT models are prone to overfitting on the
few demonstration examples. In this work, we reinterpret the forward pass of
LLMs as an optimization process, a sequence of preconditioned gradient descent
steps refining internal representations. Based on this connection, we propose
Optimization-Inspired Few-Shot Adaptation (OFA), integrating a parameterization
that learns preconditioners without introducing additional trainable
parameters, and an objective that improves optimization efficiency by learning
preconditioners based on a convergence bound, while simultaneously steering the
optimization path toward the flat local minimum. Our method overcomes both
issues of ICL-based and PEFT-based methods, and demonstrates superior
performance over the existing methods on a variety of few-shot adaptation tasks
in experiments.

Conclusion: FP4训练是高效且可行的大规模LLM训练方法。

Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, fully quantized training (FQT) of large
language models (LLMs) using predominantly 4-bit floating-point (FP4) precision
for weights, activations, and gradients on datasets up to 200 billion tokens.
We extensively investigate key design choices for FP4, including block sizes,
scaling formats, and rounding methods. Our analysis shows that the NVFP4
format, where each block of 16 FP4 values (E2M1) shares a scale represented in
E4M3, provides optimal results. We use stochastic rounding for backward and
update passes and round-to-nearest for the forward pass to enhance stability.
Additionally, we identify a theoretical and empirical threshold for effective
quantized training: when the gradient norm falls below approximately $\sqrt{3}$
times the quantization noise, quantized training becomes less effective.
Leveraging these insights, we successfully train a 7-billion-parameter model on
256 Intel Gaudi2 accelerators. The resulting FP4-trained model achieves
downstream task performance comparable to a standard BF16 baseline, confirming
that FP4 training is a practical and highly efficient approach for large-scale
LLM training. A reference implementation is supplied in

Conclusion: VRPO有效解决了MDM对齐中的方差问题，显著提升了模型性能，为未来研究提供了理论基础和实践方法。

Abstract: While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), such as LLaDA, present a promising
paradigm for language modeling, there has been relatively little effort in
aligning these models with human preferences via reinforcement learning. The
challenge primarily arises from the high variance in Evidence Lower Bound
(ELBO)-based likelihood estimates required for preference optimization. To
address this issue, we propose Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization (VRPO),
a framework that formally analyzes the variance of ELBO estimators and derives
bounds on both the bias and variance of preference optimization gradients.
Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce unbiased variance
reduction strategies, including optimal Monte Carlo budget allocation and
antithetic sampling, that significantly improve the performance of MDM
alignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VRPO by applying it to LLaDA,
and the resulting model, LLaDA 1.5, outperforms its SFT-only predecessor
consistently and significantly across mathematical (GSM8K +4.7), code
(HumanEval +3.0, MBPP +1.8), and alignment benchmarks (IFEval +4.0, Arena-Hard

performance compared to strong language MDMs and ARMs. Project page:

Result: 梯度下降在α=1（文本数据）时表现最差，迭代次数随维度线性增长；符号下降在Zipf分布数据中迭代次数仅随维度平方根增长，显著优于梯度下降。

Conclusion: 数据分布的尾部特性显著影响优化性能，符号下降（如Adam）在文本数据中更高效，为优化器设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Recent works have highlighted optimization difficulties faced by gradient
descent in training the first and last layers of transformer-based language
models, which are overcome by optimizers such as Adam. These works suggest that
the difficulty is linked to the heavy-tailed distribution of words in text
data, where the frequency of the $k$th most frequent word $\pi_k$ is
proportional to $1/k$, following Zipf's law. To better understand the impact of
the data distribution on training performance, we study a linear bigram model
for next-token prediction when the tokens follow a power law $\pi_k \propto
1/k^\alpha$ parameterized by the exponent $\alpha > 0$. We derive optimization
scaling laws for deterministic gradient descent and sign descent as a proxy for
Adam as a function of the exponent $\alpha$. Existing theoretical
investigations in scaling laws assume that the eigenvalues of the data decay as
a power law with exponent $\alpha > 1$. This assumption effectively makes the
problem ``finite dimensional'' as most of the loss comes from a few of the
largest eigencomponents. In comparison, we show that the problem is more
difficult when the data have heavier tails. The case $\alpha = 1$ as found in
text data is ``worst-case'' for gradient descent, in that the number of
iterations required to reach a small relative error scales almost linearly with
dimension. While the performance of sign descent also depends on the dimension,
for Zipf-distributed data the number of iterations scales only with the
square-root of the dimension, leading to a large improvement for large
vocabularies.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Looped Transformers have been shown to empirically

However, their comparative capabilities are still not well understood. In this

limitations. We show that Looped Transformers can efficiently simulate parallel
computations for deterministic tasks, which we formalize as evaluation over
directed acyclic graphs. In contrast, CoT with stochastic decoding excels at
approximate inference for compositional structures, namely self-reducible
problems. These separations suggest the tasks for which depth-driven recursion
is more suitable, thereby offering practical cues for choosing between
reasoning paradigms.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Finetuning (RFT) has significantly advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling long chains
of thought, self-correction, and effective tool use. While recent works attempt
to extend RFT to vision-language models (VLMs), these efforts largely produce
text-only reasoning conditioned on static image inputs, falling short of true
multimodal reasoning in the response. In contrast, test-time methods like
Visual Sketchpad incorporate visual steps but lack training mechanisms.
  We introduce VTool-R1, the first framework that trains VLMs to generate
multimodal chains of thought by interleaving text and intermediate visual
reasoning steps. VTool-R1 integrates Python-based visual editing tools into the
RFT process, enabling VLMs to learn when and how to generate visual reasoning
steps that benefit final reasoning. Trained with outcome-based rewards tied to
task accuracy, our approach elicits strategic visual tool use for reasoning
without relying on process-based supervision. Experiments on structured visual
question answering over charts and tables show that VTool-R1 enhances reasoning
performance by teaching VLMs to "think with images" and generate multimodal
chain of thoughts with tools.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) excels in complex, safety-critical
domains, yet it faces challenges such as sample inefficiency, training
instability, and a lack of interpretability. Data attribution offers a
principled way to trace model behavior back to individual training samples.
However, in online RL, each training sample not only drives policy updates but
also influences future data collection, violating the fixed dataset assumption
in existing attribution methods. In this paper, we initiate the study of data
attribution for online RL, focusing on the widely used Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm. We start by establishing a local attribution
framework, interpreting model checkpoints with respect to the records in the
recent training buffer. We design two target functions, capturing agent action
and cumulative return respectively, and measure each record's contribution
through gradient similarity between its training loss and these targets. We
demonstrate the power of this framework through three concrete applications:
diagnosis of learning, temporal analysis of behavior formation, and targeted
intervention during training. Leveraging this framework, we further propose an
algorithm, iterative influence-based filtering (IIF), for online RL training
that iteratively performs experience filtering to refine policy updates. Across
standard RL benchmarks (classic control, navigation, locomotion) to RLHF for
large language models, IIF reduces sample complexity, speeds up training, and
achieves higher returns. Overall, these results advance interpretability,
efficiency, and effectiveness of online RL.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often need to incorporate external knowledge to

empowers LLMs to generate more qualified responses with retrieved external data
and knowledge, has shown its high promise. However, traditional semantic
similarity-based RAGs struggle to return concise yet highly relevant
information for domain knowledge-intensive tasks, such as scientific
question-answering (QA). Built on a multi-dimensional (cube) structure called
Hypercube, which can index documents in an application-driven, human-defined,
multi-dimensional space, we introduce the Hypercube-RAG, a novel RAG framework
for precise and efficient retrieval. Given a query, Hypercube-RAG first
decomposes it based on its entities and topics and then retrieves relevant
documents from cubes by aligning these decomposed components with hypercube
dimensions. Experiments on three in-domain scientific QA datasets demonstrate
that our method improves accuracy by 3.7% and boosts retrieval efficiency by
81.2%, measured as relative gains over the strongest RAG baseline. More
importantly, our Hypercube-RAG inherently offers explainability by revealing
the underlying predefined hypercube dimensions used for retrieval. The code and

Abstract: Current debiasing approaches often result a degradation in model capabilities
such as factual accuracy and knowledge retention. Through systematic evaluation
across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that existing debiasing methods face
fundamental trade-offs, particularly in smaller models, leading to reduced
truthfulness, knowledge loss, or unintelligible outputs. To address these
limitations, we propose a contrastive learning framework that learns through
carefully constructed positive and negative examples. Our approach introduces
contrast computation and dynamic loss scaling to balance bias mitigation with
faithfulness preservation. Experimental results across multiple model scales
demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in both toxicity
reduction and faithfulness preservation. Most importantly, we show that our
framework is the first to consistently improve both metrics simultaneously,
avoiding the capability degradation characteristic of existing approaches.
These results suggest that explicit modeling of both positive and negative
examples through contrastive learning could be a promising direction for
reducing the alignment tax in language model debiasing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) obtain state of the art zero shot relevance
ranking performance on a variety of information retrieval tasks. The two most
common prompts to elicit LLM relevance judgments are pointwise scoring (a.k.a.
relevance generation), where the LLM sees a single query-document pair and
outputs a single relevance score, and listwise ranking (a.k.a. permutation
generation), where the LLM sees a query and a list of documents and outputs a
permutation, sorting the documents in decreasing order of relevance. The
current research community consensus is that listwise ranking yields superior
performance, and significant research effort has been devoted to crafting LLM
listwise ranking algorithms. The underlying hypothesis is that LLMs are better
at making relative relevance judgments than absolute ones. In tension with this
hypothesis, we find that the gap between pointwise scoring and listwise ranking
shrinks when pointwise scoring is implemented using a sufficiently large
ordinal relevance label space, becoming statistically insignificant for many
LLM-benchmark dataset combinations (where ``significant'' means ``95\%
confidence that listwise ranking improves NDCG@10''). Our evaluations span four
LLMs, eight benchmark datasets from the BEIR and TREC-DL suites, and two
proprietary datasets with relevance labels collected after the training cut-off

TL;DR: ACBench是首个全面评估压缩对LLM代理能力影响的基准，涵盖12个任务、多种压缩方法和15个模型，揭示了量化与剪枝的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩基准仅关注语言建模和自然语言理解任务，忽略了代理能力（如工具使用、长上下文理解等），因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 提出ACBench基准，涵盖12个任务、4种能力（如工作流生成、长上下文检索），并测试多种压缩方法（如量化、剪枝）对15个模型的影响。

Result: 4位量化能保留工作流生成和工具使用能力（下降1%-3%），但会显著降低实际应用精度（10%-15%）。

Conclusion: ACBench为代理场景下的LLM压缩优化提供了实用见解，并引入ERank等分析方法。

Abstract: Post-training compression reduces the computational and memory costs of large
language models (LLMs), enabling resource-efficient deployment. However,
existing compression benchmarks only focus on language modeling (e.g.,
perplexity) and natural language understanding tasks (e.g., GLUE accuracy),
ignoring the agentic capabilities - workflow, tool use/function call,
long-context understanding and real-world application. We introduce the Agent
Compression Benchmark (ACBench), the first comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating how compression impacts LLMs' agentic abilities. ACBench spans (1)
12 tasks across 4 capabilities (e.g., WorfBench for workflow generation,
Needle-in-Haystack for long-context retrieval), (2) quantization (GPTQ, AWQ)
and pruning (Wanda, SparseGPT), and (3) 15 models, including small (Gemma-2B),
standard (Qwen2.5 7B-32B), and distilled reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1-Distill).
Our experiments reveal compression tradeoffs: 4-bit quantization preserves
workflow generation and tool use (1%-3% drop) but degrades real-world
application accuracy by 10%-15%. We introduce ERank, Top-k Ranking Correlation
and Energy to systematize analysis. ACBench provides actionable insights for
optimizing LLM compression in agentic scenarios. The code can be found in

Conclusion: 动态系统分析为自注意力层提供了更通用的理解框架，并提出了实用的训练和监控方法。

Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily
progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit
an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable
insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on
idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in
standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these
energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference
dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider
relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in
energy-based formulations. Next, to investigate more general SA architectures
capable of oscillatory dynamics without necessarily admitting an energy
function, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the state. We reveal that
normalization layers effectively normalize the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues,
forcing the dynamics close to a critical state. This significantly enhances
inference performance. Furthermore, we utilize the Jacobian perspective to
develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring
inference dynamics.

Result: FPX在StreetFighter中胜率提升80%，在高频交易中日收益率提升26.52%。

Conclusion: 延迟感知的评估和部署策略对LLM代理至关重要，FPX框架有效平衡了延迟与质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse
reasoning and generation tasks, and are increasingly deployed as agents in
dynamic environments such as code generation and recommendation systems.
However, many real-world applications, such as high-frequency trading and
real-time competitive gaming, require decisions under strict latency
constraints, where faster responses directly translate into higher rewards.
Despite the importance of this latency quality trade off, it remains
underexplored in the context of LLM based agents. In this work, we present the
first systematic study of this trade off in real time decision making tasks. To
support our investigation, we introduce two new benchmarks: HFTBench, a high
frequency trading simulation, and StreetFighter, a competitive gaming platform.
Our analysis reveals that optimal latency quality balance varies by task, and
that sacrificing quality for lower latency can significantly enhance downstream
performance. To address this, we propose FPX, an adaptive framework that
dynamically selects model size and quantization level based on real time
demands. Our method achieves the best performance on both benchmarks, improving
win rate by up to 80% in Street Fighter and boosting daily yield by up to
26.52% in trading, underscoring the need for latency aware evaluation and
deployment strategies for LLM based agents. These results demonstrate the
critical importance of latency aware evaluation and deployment strategies for
real world LLM based agents. Our benchmarks are available at Latency Sensitive

Result: 揭示了FFN作为联想记忆的作用，探讨了Transformer的表达限制和无限上下文下的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过联想记忆的视角，为Transformer的创新提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we share our reflections and insights on understanding
Transformer architectures through the lens of associative memory--a classic
psychological concept inspired by human cognition. We start with the basics of
associative memory (think simple linear attention) and then dive into two
dimensions:
  Memory Capacity: How much can a Transformer really remember, and how well? We
introduce retrieval SNR to measure this and use a kernel perspective to
mathematically reveal why Softmax Attention is so effective. We also show how
FFNs can be seen as a type of associative memory, leading to insights on their
design and potential improvements.
  Memory Update: How do these memories learn and evolve? We present a unified
framework for understanding how different Transformer variants (like DeltaNet
and Softmax Attention) update their "knowledge base". This leads us to tackle
two provocative questions: 1. Are Transformers fundamentally limited in what
they can express, and can we break these barriers? 2. If a Transformer had
infinite context, would it become infinitely intelligent?
  We want to demystify Transformer architecture, offering a clearer
understanding of existing designs. This exploration aims to provide fresh
insights and spark new avenues for Transformer innovation.

Motivation: 现有保护方法（如水印）无法有效防止仅通过观察公开输出进行的模型模仿，因此需要一种主动防御策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持教师模型性能的同时，显著降低了学生模型的性能。

Conclusion: DOGe是一种实用且高效的防御策略，可有效防止基于KD的模型模仿。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent substantial intellectual and economic
investments, yet their effectiveness can inadvertently facilitate model
imitation via knowledge distillation (KD).In practical scenarios, competitors
can distill proprietary LLM capabilities by simply observing publicly
accessible outputs, akin to reverse-engineering a complex performance by
observation alone. Existing protective methods like watermarking only identify
imitation post-hoc, while other defenses assume the student model mimics the
teacher's internal logits, rendering them ineffective against distillation
purely from observed output text. This paper confronts the challenge of
actively protecting LLMs within the realistic constraints of API-based access.
We introduce an effective and efficient Defensive Output Generation (DOGe)
strategy that subtly modifies the output behavior of an LLM. Its outputs remain
accurate and useful for legitimate users, yet are designed to be misleading for
distillation, significantly undermining imitation attempts. We achieve this by
fine-tuning only the final linear layer of the teacher LLM with an adversarial
loss. This targeted training approach anticipates and disrupts distillation
attempts during inference time. Our experiments show that, while preserving or
even improving the original performance of the teacher model, student models
distilled from the defensively generated teacher outputs demonstrate
catastrophically reduced performance, demonstrating our method's effectiveness
as a practical safeguard against KD-based model imitation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in ex-ante
reasoning, where analysis, inference, or predictions must be made without
access to information from future events. Even with explicit prompts enforcing
temporal cutoffs, LLMs often generate outputs influenced by internalized
knowledge of events beyond the specified cutoff. This paper introduces a novel
task and benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to reason while
adhering to such temporal constraints. The benchmark includes a variety of
tasks: stock prediction, Wikipedia event prediction, scientific publication
prediction, and Question Answering (QA), designed to assess factual knowledge
under temporal cutoff constraints. We use leakage rate to quantify models'
reliance on future information beyond cutoff timestamps. Experimental results
reveal that LLMs struggle to consistently adhere to temporal cutoffs across
common prompting strategies and tasks, demonstrating persistent challenges in
ex-ante reasoning. This benchmark provides a potential evaluation framework to
advance the development of LLMs' temporal reasoning ability for time-sensitive
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法通过共享精确模式，高效捕捉注意力动态，显著提升长上下文推理性能。

Abstract: Sparse attention methods exploit the inherent sparsity in attention to speed
up the prefilling phase of long-context inference, mitigating the quadratic
complexity of full attention computation. While existing sparse attention
methods rely on predefined patterns or inaccurate estimations to approximate
attention behavior, they often fail to fully capture the true dynamics of
attention, resulting in reduced efficiency and compromised accuracy. Instead,
we propose a highly accurate sparse attention mechanism that shares similar yet
precise attention patterns across heads, enabling a more realistic capture of
the dynamic behavior of attention. Our approach is grounded in two key
observations: (1) attention patterns demonstrate strong inter-head similarity,
and (2) this similarity remains remarkably consistent across diverse inputs. By
strategically sharing computed accurate patterns across attention heads, our
method effectively captures actual patterns while requiring full attention
computation for only a small subset of heads. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior or comparable speedup relative
to state-of-the-art methods while delivering the best overall accuracy.

Result: 实验表明，Skrull在真实长-SFT场景中平均比DeepSpeed快3.76倍（最高7.54倍）。

Conclusion: Skrull通过动态数据调度有效解决了长-SFT中的异构数据分布问题，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Long-context supervised fine-tuning (Long-SFT) plays a vital role in
enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on long-context
tasks. To smoothly adapt LLMs to long-context scenarios, this process typically
entails training on mixed datasets containing both long and short sequences.
However, this heterogeneous sequence length distribution poses significant
challenges for existing training systems, as they fail to simultaneously
achieve high training efficiency for both long and short sequences, resulting
in sub-optimal end-to-end system performance in Long-SFT. In this paper, we
present a novel perspective on data scheduling to address the challenges posed
by the heterogeneous data distributions in Long-SFT. We propose Skrull, a
dynamic data scheduler specifically designed for efficient long-SFT. Through
dynamic data scheduling, Skrull balances the computation requirements of long
and short sequences, improving overall training efficiency. Furthermore, we
formulate the scheduling process as a joint optimization problem and thoroughly
analyze the trade-offs involved. Based on those analysis, Skrull employs a
lightweight scheduling algorithm to achieve near-zero cost online scheduling in
Long-SFT. Finally, we implement Skrull upon DeepSpeed, a state-of-the-art
distributed training system for LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that
Skrull outperforms DeepSpeed by 3.76x on average (up to 7.54x) in real-world
long-SFT scenarios.

Conclusion: 新框架有效提升单模态推理能力，同时增强多模态任务表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across tasks, yet they often exhibit difficulty in distinguishing
task-relevant from irrelevant signals, particularly in tasks like Visual
Question Answering (VQA), which can lead to susceptibility to misleading or
spurious inputs. We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality
Competency Problem: the model's inability to fairly evaluate all modalities.
This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks such as
image classification or pure text question answering, where models are expected
to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from
irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We
refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and
measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem. We further design
a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this
problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to
fine-tune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both
heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations via Projected Gradient
Descent (PGD), and a consistency regularization strategy applied to model
outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark
datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy, and VQA tasks) and multiple model families
with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and
cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting
unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: MoE在SD技术下具有显著加速潜力，'目标效率'指标为SD研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across many
applications, with Mixture of Experts (MoE) models demonstrating great
potential. Compared to traditional dense models, MoEs achieve better
performance with less computation. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used
technique to accelerate LLM inference without accuracy loss, but it has been
considered efficient only for dense models. In this work, we first demonstrate
that, under medium batch sizes, MoE surprisingly benefits more from SD than
dense models. Furthermore, as MoE becomes sparser -- the prevailing trend in
MoE designs -- the batch size range where SD acceleration is expected to be
effective becomes broader. To quantitatively understand tradeoffs involved in
SD, we develop a reliable modeling based on theoretical analyses. While current
SD research primarily focuses on improving acceptance rates of algorithms,
changes in workload and model architecture can still lead to degraded SD
acceleration even with high acceptance rates. To address this limitation, we
introduce a new metric 'target efficiency' that characterizes these effects,
thus helping researchers identify system bottlenecks and understand SD
acceleration more comprehensively. For scenarios like private serving, this
work unveils a new perspective to speed up MoE inference, where existing
solutions struggle. Experiments on different GPUs show up to 2.29x speedup for
Qwen2-57B-A14B at medium batch sizes and validate our theoretical predictions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, but optimizing LLM-based agentic systems remains challenging due
to the vast search space of agent configurations, prompting strategies, and
communication patterns. Existing approaches often rely on heuristic-based
tuning or exhaustive evaluation, which can be computationally expensive and
suboptimal. This paper proposes Agentic Predictor, a lightweight predictor for
efficient agentic workflow evaluation. Agentic Predictor is equipped with a
multi-view workflow encoding technique that leverages multi-view representation
learning of agentic systems by incorporating code architecture, textual
prompts, and interaction graph features. To achieve high predictive accuracy
while significantly reducing the number of required workflow evaluations for
training a predictor, Agentic Predictor employs cross-domain unsupervised
pretraining. By learning to approximate task success rates, Agentic Predictor
enables fast and accurate selection of optimal agentic workflow configurations
for a given task, significantly reducing the need for expensive trial-and-error
evaluations. Experiments on a carefully curated benchmark spanning three
domains show that our predictor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
predictive accuracy and workflow utility, highlighting the potential of
performance predictors in streamlining the design of LLM-based agentic

Abstract: We present a fine-grained theoretical analysis of the performance gap between
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) under a representation gap. Our study decomposes this gap
into two sources: an explicit representation gap under exact optimization and
an implicit representation gap under finite samples. In the exact optimization
setting, we characterize how the relative capacities of the reward and policy
model classes influence the final policy qualities. We show that RLHF, DPO, or
online DPO can outperform one another depending on the type of model
mis-specifications. Notably, online DPO can outperform both RLHF and standard
DPO when the reward and policy model classes are isomorphic and both
mis-specified. In the approximate optimization setting, we provide a concrete
construction where the ground-truth reward is implicitly sparse and show that
RLHF requires significantly fewer samples than DPO to recover an effective
reward model -- highlighting a statistical advantage of two-stage learning.
Together, these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the
performance gap between RLHF and DPO under various settings, and offer
practical insights into when each method is preferred.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential
for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under
distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome
these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a
systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs
compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically
investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and
execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning,
particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic
understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable
visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs
than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for
efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for
improving VLA generalization. The project page is at https://rlvla.github.io

Abstract: Sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) can model a wide range of highly
complex tasks. Solving sparse-reward tasks is RL's core premise - requiring
efficient exploration coupled with long-horizon credit assignment - and
overcoming these challenges is key for building self-improving agents with
superhuman ability. We argue that solving complex and high-dimensional tasks
requires solving simpler tasks that are relevant to the target task. In
contrast, most prior work designs strategies for selecting exploratory tasks
with the objective of solving any task, making exploration of challenging
high-dimensional, long-horizon tasks intractable. We find that the sense of
direction, necessary for effective exploration, can be extracted from existing
RL algorithms, without needing any prior information. Based on this finding, we
propose a method for directed sparse-reward goal-conditioned very long-horizon
RL (DISCOVER), which selects exploratory goals in the direction of the target
task. We connect DISCOVER to principled exploration in bandits, formally
bounding the time until the target task becomes achievable in terms of the
agent's initial distance to the target, but independent of the volume of the
space of all tasks. Empirically, we perform a thorough evaluation in
high-dimensional environments. We find that the directed goal selection of
DISCOVER solves exploration problems that are beyond the reach of prior
state-of-the-art exploration methods in RL.

Result: 某些编辑方法（如WISE和AlphaEdit）在遗忘任务中表现优异，尤其是针对预训练知识，并能生成符合人类期望的拒绝回答。

Conclusion: 建议遗忘研究采用SOTA编辑方法作为基线，并从编辑视角探索更全面的LLM记忆控制。

Abstract: Large language Model (LLM) unlearning, i.e., selectively removing information
from LLMs, is vital for responsible model deployment. Differently, LLM
knowledge editing aims to modify LLM knowledge instead of removing it. Though
editing and unlearning seem to be two distinct tasks, we find there is a tight
connection between them. In this paper, we conceptualize unlearning as a
special case of editing where information is modified to a refusal or "empty
set" $\emptyset$ response, signifying its removal. This paper thus investigates
if knowledge editing techniques are strong baselines for LLM unlearning. We
evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) editing methods (e.g., ROME, MEMIT, GRACE,
WISE, and AlphaEdit) against existing unlearning approaches on pretrained and
finetuned knowledge. Results show certain editing methods, notably WISE and
AlphaEdit, are effective unlearning baselines, especially for pretrained
knowledge, and excel in generating human-aligned refusal answers. To better
adapt editing methods for unlearning applications, we propose practical recipes
including self-improvement and query merging. The former leverages the LLM's
own in-context learning ability to craft a more human-aligned unlearning
target, and the latter enables ROME and MEMIT to perform well in unlearning
longer sample sequences. We advocate for the unlearning community to adopt SOTA
editing methods as baselines and explore unlearning from an editing perspective
for more holistic LLM memory control.

Result: MIST在多种持续学习基准测试中显著提升了性能，且与多种基线方法结合均表现优异。

Conclusion: MIST是一种即插即用的方法，能在保留预训练知识的同时，高效适应任务。

Abstract: Continual Learning with Pre-trained Models holds great promise for efficient
adaptation across sequential tasks. However, most existing approaches freeze
PTMs and rely on auxiliary modules like prompts or adapters, limiting model
plasticity and leading to suboptimal generalization when facing significant
distribution shifts. While full fine-tuning can improve adaptability, it risks
disrupting crucial pre-trained knowledge. In this paper, we propose Mutual
Information-guided Sparse Tuning (MIST), a plug-and-play method that
selectively updates a small subset of PTM parameters, less than 5%, based on
sensitivity to mutual information objectives. MIST enables effective
task-specific adaptation while preserving generalization. To further reduce
interference, we introduce strong sparsity regularization by randomly dropping
gradients during tuning, resulting in fewer than 0.5% of parameters being
updated per step. Applied before standard freeze-based methods, MIST
consistently boosts performance across diverse continual learning benchmarks.
Experiments show that integrating our method into multiple baselines yields
significant performance gains. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of selecting the right LLM for tasks without technical expertise, balancing user needs (factual correctness, safety) and provider costs.

Method: MESS+ uses real-time learning of request satisfaction probabilities, virtual queues, and request satisfaction prediction to solve per-request optimization.

Result: Achieves 2x cost savings compared to existing LLM routing techniques across benchmarks.

Conclusion: MESS+ effectively balances cost and quality in LLM routing, providing a practical solution for users and providers.

Abstract: Open-weight LLM zoos provide access to numerous high-quality models, but
selecting the appropriate model for specific tasks remains challenging and
requires technical expertise. Most users simply want factually correct, safe,
and satisfying responses without concerning themselves with model
technicalities, while inference service providers prioritize minimizing
operating costs. These competing interests are typically mediated through
service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee minimum service quality. We
introduce MESS+, a stochastic optimization algorithm for cost-optimal LLM
request routing while providing rigorous SLA compliance guarantees. MESS+
learns request satisfaction probabilities of LLMs in real-time as users
interact with the system, based on which model selection decisions are made by
solving a per-request optimization problem. Our algorithm includes a novel
combination of virtual queues and request satisfaction prediction, along with a
theoretical analysis of cost optimality and constraint satisfaction. Across a
wide range of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, MESS+ achieves an average of 2x
cost savings compared to existing LLM routing techniques.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖启发式方法，难以捕捉数据的细微特征，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 利用影响函数系统地分析训练数据对LLMs推理能力的影响，提出数据集重加权策略。

Result: 发现高难度数学任务对数学和编码推理均有提升，低难度编码任务对编码推理最有效；重加权策略显著提升了模型在AIME24和LiveCodeBench上的表现。

Conclusion: Infra方法揭示了数据特征对推理能力的影响，为优化训练数据提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities in math and coding, often bolstered by post-training on the
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) generated by stronger models. However, existing
strategies for curating such training data predominantly rely on heuristics,
limiting generalizability and failing to capture subtleties underlying in data.
To address these limitations, we leverage influence functions to systematically
attribute LLMs' reasoning ability on math and coding to individual training
examples, sequences, and tokens, enabling deeper insights into effective data
characteristics. Our Influence-based Reasoning Attribution (Infra) uncovers
nontrivial cross-domain effects across math and coding tasks: high-difficulty
math examples improve both math and code reasoning, while low-difficulty code
tasks most effectively benefit code reasoning. Based on these findings, we
introduce a simple yet effective dataset reweighting strategy by flipping task
difficulty, which doubles AIME24 accuracy from 10\% to 20\% and boosts
LiveCodeBench accuracy from 33.8\% to 35.3\% for Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Moreover,
our fine-grained attribution reveals that the sequence-level exploratory
behaviors enhance reasoning performance in both math and code, and the
token-level influence patterns are distinct for math and code reasoning: the
former prefers natural language logic connectors and the latter emphasizes
structural syntax.

Conclusion: 结论指出，需要结合人类评分和算法创新才能扩展RL在人类反馈任务中的成功。

Abstract: Recent progress in strengthening the capabilities of large language models
has stemmed from applying reinforcement learning to domains with automatically
verifiable outcomes. A key question is whether we can similarly use RL to
optimize for outcomes in domains where evaluating outcomes inherently requires
human feedback; for example, in tasks like deep research and trip planning,
outcome evaluation is qualitative and there are many possible degrees of
success. One attractive and scalable modality for collecting human feedback is
preference data: ordinal rankings (pairwise or $k$-wise) that indicate, for $k$
given outcomes, which one is preferred. In this work, we study a critical
roadblock: preference data fundamentally and significantly limits outcome-based
optimization. Even with idealized preference data (infinite, noiseless, and
online), the use of ordinal feedback can prevent obtaining even approximately
optimal solutions. We formalize this impossibility using voting theory, drawing
an analogy between how a model chooses to answer a query with how voters choose
a candidate to elect. This indicates that grounded human scoring and
algorithmic innovations are necessary for extending the success of RL
post-training to domains demanding human feedback. We also explore why these
limitations have disproportionately impacted RLHF when it comes to eliciting
reasoning behaviors (e.g., backtracking) versus situations where RLHF has been
historically successful (e.g., instruction-tuning and safety training), finding
that the limitations of preference data primarily suppress RLHF's ability to
elicit robust strategies -- a class that encompasses most reasoning behaviors.

Conclusion: GenICL通过生成式偏好学习有效解决了演示选择问题，提升了ICL效果。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to
new tasks during inference using only a few demonstrations. However, ICL
performance is highly dependent on the selection of these demonstrations.
Recent work explores retrieval-based methods for selecting query-specific
demonstrations, but these approaches often rely on surrogate objectives such as
metric learning, failing to directly optimize ICL performance. Consequently,
they struggle to identify truly beneficial demonstrations. Moreover, their
discriminative retrieval paradigm is ineffective when the candidate pool lacks
sufficient high-quality demonstrations. To address these challenges, we propose
GenICL, a novel generative preference learning framework that leverages LLM
feedback to directly optimize demonstration selection for ICL. Experiments on
19 datasets across 11 task categories demonstrate that GenICL achieves superior
performance than existing methods in selecting the most effective
demonstrations, leading to better ICL performance.

Abstract: Massive transformer-based models face several challenges, including slow and
computationally intensive pre-training and over-parametrization. This paper
addresses these challenges by proposing a versatile method called GQKVA, which
generalizes query, key, and value grouping techniques. GQKVA is designed to
speed up transformer pre-training while reducing the model size. Our
experiments with various GQKVA variants highlight a clear trade-off between
performance and model size, allowing for customized choices based on resource
and time limitations. Our findings also indicate that the conventional
multi-head attention approach is not always the best choice, as there are
lighter and faster alternatives available. We tested our method on ViT, which
achieved an approximate 0.3% increase in accuracy while reducing the model size
by about 4% in the task of image classification. Additionally, our most
aggressive model reduction experiment resulted in a reduction of approximately
15% in model size, with only around a 1% drop in accuracy.

Abstract: Post-hoc interpretability methods typically attribute a model's behavior to
its components, data, or training trajectory in isolation. This leads to
explanations that lack a unified view and may miss key interactions. While
combining existing methods or applying them at different training stages offers
broader insights, these approaches usually lack theoretical support. In this
work, we present ExPLAIND, a unified framework that integrates all three
perspectives. First, we generalize recent work on gradient path kernels, which
reformulate models trained by gradient descent as a kernel machine, to more
realistic training settings. Empirically, we find that both a CNN and a
Transformer model are replicated accurately by this reformulation. Second, we
derive novel parameter- and step-wise influence scores from the kernel feature
maps. We show their effectiveness in parameter pruning that is comparable to
existing methods, reinforcing their value for model component attribution.
Finally, jointly interpreting model components and data over the training
process, we leverage ExPLAIND to analyze a Transformer that exhibits Grokking.
Among other things, our findings support previously proposed stages of
Grokking, while refining the final phase as one of alignment of input
embeddings and final layers around a representation pipeline learned after the
memorization phase. Overall, ExPLAIND provides a theoretically grounded,
unified framework to interpret model behavior and training dynamics.

Abstract: Reasoning has substantially improved the performance of large language models
(LLMs) on complicated tasks. Central to the current reasoning studies, Process
Reward Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning
steps and guide the reasoning process. However, extending PRMs to multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges. Since multimodal reasoning
covers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting
distribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to
greater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM,
therefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage.
However, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from a marked quality
imbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for an
effective data selection strategy. To address the issues, we introduce
DreamPRM, a domain-reweighted training framework for multimodal PRMs which
employs bi-level optimization. In the lower-level optimization, DreamPRM
performs fine-tuning on multiple datasets with domain weights, allowing the PRM
to prioritize high-quality reasoning signals and alleviating the impact of
dataset quality imbalance. In the upper-level optimization, the PRM is
evaluated on a separate meta-learning dataset; this feedback updates the domain
weights through an aggregation loss function, thereby improving the
generalization capability of trained PRM. Extensive experiments on multiple
multimodal reasoning benchmarks covering both mathematical and general
reasoning show that test-time scaling with DreamPRM consistently improves the
performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Further comparisons reveal that
DreamPRM's domain-reweighting strategy surpasses other data selection methods
and yields higher accuracy gains than existing test-time scaling approaches.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are a prominent tool in mechanistic
interpretability (MI) for decomposing neural network activations into
interpretable features. However, the aspiration to identify a canonical set of
features is challenged by the observed inconsistency of learned SAE features
across different training runs, undermining the reliability and efficiency of
MI research. This position paper argues that mechanistic interpretability
should prioritize feature consistency in SAEs -- the reliable convergence to
equivalent feature sets across independent runs. We propose using the Pairwise
Dictionary Mean Correlation Coefficient (PW-MCC) as a practical metric to
operationalize consistency and demonstrate that high levels are achievable
(0.80 for TopK SAEs on LLM activations) with appropriate architectural choices.
Our contributions include detailing the benefits of prioritizing consistency;
providing theoretical grounding and synthetic validation using a model
organism, which verifies PW-MCC as a reliable proxy for ground-truth recovery;
and extending these findings to real-world LLM data, where high feature
consistency strongly correlates with the semantic similarity of learned feature
explanations. We call for a community-wide shift towards systematically
measuring feature consistency to foster robust cumulative progress in MI.

Abstract: Large language models excel at pattern matching, yet often fall short in
systematic compositional generalization. We propose the coverage principle: a
data-centric framework showing that models relying primarily on pattern
matching for compositional tasks cannot reliably generalize beyond substituting
fragments that yield identical results when used in the same contexts. We
demonstrate that this framework has a strong predictive power for the
generalization capabilities of Transformers. First, we derive and empirically
confirm that the training data required for two-hop generalization grows at
least quadratically with the token set size, and the training data efficiency
does not improve with 20x parameter scaling. Second, for compositional tasks
with path ambiguity where one variable affects the output through multiple
computational paths, we show that Transformers learn context-dependent state
representations that undermine both performance and interoperability. Third,
Chain-of-Thought supervision improves training data efficiency for multi-hop
tasks but still struggles with path ambiguity. Finally, we outline a
\emph{mechanism-based} taxonomy that distinguishes three ways neural networks
can generalize: structure-based (bounded by coverage), property-based
(leveraging algebraic invariances), and shared-operator (through function
reuse). This conceptual lens contextualizes our results and highlights where
new architectural ideas are needed to achieve systematic compositionally.
Overall, the coverage principle provides a unified lens for understanding
compositional reasoning, and underscores the need for fundamental architectural
or training innovations to achieve truly systematic compositionality.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the widespread
adoption of third-party inference services, raising critical privacy concerns.
Existing methods of performing private third-party inference, such as Secure
Multiparty Computation (SMPC), often rely on cryptographic methods. However,
these methods are thousands of times slower than standard unencrypted
inference, and fail to scale to large modern LLMs. Therefore, recent lines of
work have explored the replacement of expensive encrypted nonlinear
computations in SMPC with statistical obfuscation methods - in particular,
revealing permuted hidden states to the third parties, with accompanying strong
claims of the difficulty of reversal into the unpermuted states. In this work,
we begin by introducing a novel reconstruction technique that can recover
original prompts from hidden states with nearly perfect accuracy across
multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. We then show that extensions of our attack are
nearly perfectly effective in reversing permuted hidden states of LLMs,
demonstrating the insecurity of three recently proposed privacy schemes. We
further dissect the shortcomings of prior theoretical `proofs' of permuation
security which allow our attack to succeed. Our findings highlight the
importance of rigorous security analysis in privacy-preserving LLM inference.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization, where a student model trained on imperfect
labels generated by a weaker teacher nonetheless surpasses that teacher, has
been widely observed but the mechanisms that enable it have remained poorly
understood. In this paper, through a theoretical analysis of simple models, we
uncover three core mechanisms that can drive this phenomenon. First, by
analyzing ridge regression, we study the interplay between the teacher and
student regularization and prove that a student can compensate for a teacher's
under-regularization and achieve lower test error. We also analyze the role of
the parameterization regime of the models. Second, by analyzing weighted ridge
regression, we show that a student model with a regularization structure more
aligned to the target, can outperform its teacher. Third, in a nonlinear
multi-index setting, we demonstrate that a student can learn easy,
task-specific features from the teacher while leveraging its own broader
pre-training to learn hard-to-learn features that the teacher cannot capture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管softmax-contaminated MoE模型在微调下游任务时广泛应用，但其理论性质尚未被深入研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，探讨参数估计的收敛速率及其统计特性。

Method: 通过最大似然估计方法分析门控和提示参数的收敛速率，提出了一种新的可区分性概念，并基于此推导了参数估计的极小极大最优速率。

Result: 在可区分性条件下，门控和提示参数可以快速收敛；若条件不满足，收敛速率显著减慢。实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 可区分性是影响参数估计效率的关键因素，为MoE模型的微调提供了理论指导。

Abstract: The softmax-contaminated mixture of experts (MoE) model is deployed when a
large-scale pre-trained model, which plays the role of a fixed expert, is
fine-tuned for learning downstream tasks by including a new contamination part,
or prompt, functioning as a new, trainable expert. Despite its popularity and
relevance, the theoretical properties of the softmax-contaminated MoE have
remained unexplored in the literature. In the paper, we study the convergence
rates of the maximum likelihood estimator of gating and prompt parameters in
order to gain insights into the statistical properties and potential challenges
of fine-tuning with a new prompt. We find that the estimability of these
parameters is compromised when the prompt acquires overlapping knowledge with
the pre-trained model, in the sense that we make precise by formulating a novel
analytic notion of distinguishability. Under distinguishability of the
pre-trained and prompt models, we derive minimax optimal estimation rates for
all the gating and prompt parameters. By contrast, when the distinguishability
condition is violated, these estimation rates become significantly slower due
to their dependence on the prompt convergence rate to the pre-trained model.
Finally, we empirically corroborate our theoretical findings through several
numerical experiments.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in mitigating
hallucinations in large language models by incorporating external knowledge
during inference. However, this integration introduces new security
vulnerabilities, particularly to poisoning attacks. Although prior work has
explored various poisoning strategies, a thorough assessment of their practical
threat to RAG systems remains missing. To address this gap, we propose the
first comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating poisoning attacks on
RAG. Our benchmark covers 5 standard question answering (QA) datasets and 10
expanded variants, along with 13 poisoning attack methods and 7 defense
mechanisms, representing a broad spectrum of existing techniques. Using this
benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of all included attacks and
defenses across the full dataset spectrum. Our findings show that while
existing attacks perform well on standard QA datasets, their effectiveness
drops significantly on the expanded versions. Moreover, our results demonstrate
that various advanced RAG architectures, such as sequential, branching,
conditional, and loop RAG, as well as multi-turn conversational RAG, multimodal
RAG systems, and RAG-based LLM agent systems, remain susceptible to poisoning
attacks. Notably, current defense techniques fail to provide robust protection,
underscoring the pressing need for more resilient and generalizable defense
strategies.

Abstract: The widespread use of generative models has created a feedback loop, in which
each generation of models is trained on data partially produced by its
predecessors. This process has raised concerns about \emph{model collapse}: A
critical degradation in performance caused by repeated training on synthetic
data. However, different analyses in the literature have reached different
conclusions as to the severity of model collapse. As such, it remains unclear
how concerning this phenomenon is, and under which assumptions it can be
avoided. To address this, we theoretically study model collapse for maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE), in a natural setting where synthetic data is
gradually added to the original data set. Under standard assumptions (similar
to those long used for proving asymptotic consistency and normality of MLE), we
establish non-asymptotic bounds showing that collapse can be avoided even as
the fraction of real data vanishes. On the other hand, we prove that some
assumptions (beyond MLE consistency) are indeed necessary: Without them, model
collapse can occur arbitrarily quickly, even when the original data is still
present in the training set. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first
rigorous examples of iterative generative modeling with accumulating data that
rapidly leads to model collapse.

Abstract: Human-annotated data plays a vital role in training large language models
(LLMs), such as supervised fine-tuning and human preference alignment. However,
it is not guaranteed that paid human annotators produce high-quality data. In
this paper, we study how to incentivize human annotators to do so. We start
from a principal-agent model to model the dynamics between the company (the
principal) and the annotator (the agent), where the principal can only monitor
the annotation quality by examining $n$ samples. We investigate the maximum
likelihood estimators (MLE) and the corresponding hypothesis testing to
incentivize annotators: the agent is given a bonus if the MLE passes the test.
By analyzing the variance of the outcome, we show that the strategic behavior
of the agent makes the hypothesis testing very different from traditional ones:
Unlike the exponential rate proved by the large deviation theory, the
principal-agent model's hypothesis testing rate is of $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n \log
n})$. Our theory implies two criteria for the \emph{golden questions} to
monitor the performance of the annotators: they should be of (1) high certainty
and (2) similar format to normal ones. In that light, we select a set of golden
questions in human preference data. By doing incentive-compatible experiments,
we find out that the annotators' behavior is better revealed by those golden
questions, compared to traditional survey techniques such as instructed
manipulation checks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) represent a new paradigm for processing
unstructured data, with applications across an unprecedented range of domains.
In this paper, we address, through two arguments, whether the development and
application of LLMs would genuinely benefit from foundational contributions
from the statistics discipline. First, we argue affirmatively, beginning with
the observation that LLMs are inherently statistical models due to their
profound data dependency and stochastic generation processes, where statistical
insights are naturally essential for handling variability and uncertainty.
Second, we argue that the persistent black-box nature of LLMs -- stemming from
their immense scale, architectural complexity, and development practices often
prioritizing empirical performance over theoretical interpretability -- renders
closed-form or purely mechanistic analyses generally intractable, thereby
necessitating statistical approaches due to their flexibility and often
demonstrated effectiveness. To substantiate these arguments, the paper outlines
several research areas -- including alignment, watermarking, uncertainty
quantification, evaluation, and data mixture optimization -- where statistical
methodologies are critically needed and are already beginning to make valuable
contributions. We conclude with a discussion suggesting that statistical
research concerning LLMs will likely form a diverse ``mosaic'' of specialized
topics rather than deriving from a single unifying theory, and highlighting the
importance of timely engagement by our statistics community in LLM research.

Abstract: Modern foundational models are often compressed via a combination of
structured pruning and re-training to meet the strict compute, memory, and
connectivity constraints of edge deployments. While state-of-the-art pruning
schemes target the entire Transformer, we adopt a simple, layer-wise L2-norm
pruning on only the MLP blocks as a fixed baseline. Our focus is not on
achieving maximal compression, but on isolating the impact of the re-training
loss function: (i) Fine-tuning with Cross- Entropy (L2PFT), which requires
labeled data, versus (ii) Self-Distillation with KL-divergence, which leverages
only teacher logits (no labels) (L2PSD). We evaluate both pipelines on the
OLMo2- 7B-SFT model for CommonsenseQA suitable for intermittent or denied
connectivity scenarios typical of edge networks. Under identical pruning
schedules, KL-based distillation matches or exceeds CE fine-tuning in test
accuracy, demonstrating that, even with a basic MLP-only pruning, the choice of
loss function materially affects compressed model recovery in
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: We propose a testable universality hypothesis, asserting that seemingly
disparate neural network solutions observed in the simple task of modular
addition are unified under a common abstract algorithm. While prior work
interpreted variations in neuron-level representations as evidence for distinct
algorithms, we demonstrate - through multi-level analyses spanning neurons,
neuron clusters, and entire networks - that multilayer perceptrons and
transformers universally implement the abstract algorithm we call the
approximate Chinese Remainder Theorem. Crucially, we introduce approximate
cosets and show that neurons activate exclusively on them. Furthermore, our
theory works for deep neural networks (DNNs). It predicts that universally
learned solutions in DNNs with trainable embeddings or more than one hidden
layer require only O(log n) features, a result we empirically confirm. This
work thus provides the first theory-backed interpretation of multilayer
networks solving modular addition. It advances generalizable interpretability
and opens a testable universality hypothesis for group multiplication beyond
modular addition.

Abstract: Transfer reinforcement learning aims to derive a near-optimal policy for a
target environment with limited data by leveraging abundant data from related
source domains. However, it faces two key challenges: the lack of performance
guarantees for the transferred policy, which can lead to undesired actions, and
the risk of negative transfer when multiple source domains are involved. We
propose a novel framework based on the pessimism principle, which constructs
and optimizes a conservative estimation of the target domain's performance. Our
framework effectively addresses the two challenges by providing an optimized
lower bound on target performance, ensuring safe and reliable decisions, and by
exhibiting monotonic improvement with respect to the quality of the source
domains, thereby avoiding negative transfer. We construct two types of
conservative estimations, rigorously characterize their effectiveness, and
develop efficient distributed algorithms with convergence guarantees. Our
framework provides a theoretically sound and practically robust solution for
transfer learning in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Error correction is an important capability when applying large language

error correction domain knowledge to build a scalable and reliable addition to
the existing data synthesis pipeline. We then adapt the synthetic data
distribution to match the mobile application domain by reweighting the samples.
The reweighting model is learnt by predicting (a handful of) live A/B test
metrics when deploying LLMs in production, given the LLM performance on offline
evaluation data and scores from a small privacy-preserving on-device language
model. Finally, we present best practices for mixing our synthetic data with
other data sources to improve model performance on error correction in both
offline evaluation and production live A/B testing.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress,
their proficiency in graph-related tasks remains notably limited, hindering the
development of truly general-purpose models. Previous attempts, including
pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often
face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented
graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that
Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can
significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we
curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50
diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data
and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1
obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B
model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also
show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph
encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as
real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising
general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for
building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic
tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with
abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess
graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully.

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to measure how training data
impacts a model's predictions. While gradient-based attribution methods, such
as influence functions, offer theoretical grounding, their computational costs
make them impractical for large-scale applications. Representation-based
approaches are far more scalable, but typically rely on heuristic embeddings
that are not optimized for attribution, limiting their fidelity. To address
these challenges, we propose AirRep, a scalable, representation-based approach
that closes this gap by learning task-specific and model-aligned
representations optimized explicitly for TDA. AirRep introduces two key
innovations: a trainable encoder tuned for attribution quality, and an
attention-based pooling mechanism that enables accurate estimation of
group-wise influence. We train AirRep using a ranking objective over
automatically constructed training subsets labeled by their empirical effect on
target predictions. Experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs demonstrate that
AirRep achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art gradient-based
approaches while being nearly two orders of magnitude more efficient at
inference time. Further analysis highlights its robustness and generalization
across tasks and models. Our code is available at

Abstract: Nowadays, real-world data, including graph-structure data, often arrives in a
streaming manner, which means that learning systems need to continuously
acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information.
Although substantial existing works attempt to address catastrophic forgetting
in graph machine learning, they are all based on training from scratch with
streaming data. With the rise of pretrained models, an increasing number of
studies have leveraged their strong generalization ability for continual
learning. Therefore, in this work, we attempt to answer whether large language
models (LLMs) can mitigate catastrophic forgetting in Graph Continual Learning
(GCL). We first point out that current experimental setups for GCL have
significant flaws, as the evaluation stage may lead to task ID leakage. Then,
we evaluate the performance of LLMs in more realistic scenarios and find that
even minor modifications can lead to outstanding results. Finally, based on
extensive experiments, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, Simple Graph
Continual Learning (SimGCL), that surpasses the previous state-of-the-art
GNN-based baseline by around 20% under the rehearsal-free constraint. To
facilitate reproducibility, we have developed an easy-to-use benchmark LLM4GCL

Abstract: The recent success of State-Space Models (SSMs) in sequence modeling has
motivated their adaptation to graph learning, giving rise to Graph State-Space
Models (GSSMs). However, existing GSSMs operate by applying SSM modules to
sequences extracted from graphs, often compromising core properties such as
permutation equivariance, message-passing compatibility, and computational
efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective by embedding the key
principles of modern SSM computation directly into the Message-Passing Neural
Network framework, resulting in a unified methodology for both static and
temporal graphs. Our approach, MP-SSM, enables efficient,
permutation-equivariant, and long-range information propagation while
preserving the architectural simplicity of message passing. Crucially, MP-SSM
enables an exact sensitivity analysis, which we use to theoretically
characterize information flow and evaluate issues like vanishing gradients and
over-squashing in the deep regime. Furthermore, our design choices allow for a
highly optimized parallel implementation akin to modern SSMs. We validate
MP-SSM across a wide range of tasks, including node classification, graph
property prediction, long-range benchmarks, and spatiotemporal forecasting,
demonstrating both its versatility and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Reward-driven proactive dialogue agents require precise estimation of user
satisfaction as an intrinsic reward signal to determine optimal interaction
strategies. Specifically, this framework triggers clarification questions when
detecting potential user dissatisfaction during interactions in the industrial
dialogue system. Traditional works typically rely on training a neural network
model based on weak labels which are generated by a simple model trained on
user actions after current turn. However, existing methods suffer from two
critical limitations in real-world scenarios: (1) Noisy Reward Supervision,
dependence on weak labels derived from post-hoc user actions introduces bias,
particularly failing to capture satisfaction signals in ASR-error-induced
utterances; (2) Long-Tail Feedback Sparsity, the power-law distribution of user
queries causes reward prediction accuracy to drop in low-frequency domains. The
noise in the weak labels and a power-law distribution of user utterances
results in that the model is hard to learn good representation of user
utterances and sessions. To address these limitations, we propose two auxiliary
tasks to improve the representation learning of user utterances and sessions
that enhance user satisfaction prediction. The first one is a contrastive
self-supervised learning task, which helps the model learn the representation

Motivation: 扩散策略在离线RL中表现优异，但在在线RL（如PPO）中应用不足，尤其是在大规模并行GPU模拟器（如IsaacLab）中。

Method: 提出GenPO框架，利用精确扩散反转构建可逆动作映射，通过双虚拟动作机制实现对数似然计算。

Conclusion: GenPO为扩散策略在大规模并行训练和机器人部署中开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the powerful
exploration capabilities and multimodality of generative diffusion-based
policies. While substantial progress has been made in offline RL and off-policy
RL settings, integrating diffusion policies into on-policy frameworks like PPO
remains underexplored. This gap is particularly significant given the
widespread use of large-scale parallel GPU-accelerated simulators, such as
IsaacLab, which are optimized for on-policy RL algorithms and enable rapid
training of complex robotic tasks. A key challenge lies in computing
state-action log-likelihoods under diffusion policies, which is straightforward
for Gaussian policies but intractable for flow-based models due to irreversible
forward-reverse processes and discretization errors (e.g., Euler-Maruyama
approximations). To bridge this gap, we propose GenPO, a generative policy
optimization framework that leverages exact diffusion inversion to construct
invertible action mappings. GenPO introduces a novel doubled dummy action
mechanism that enables invertibility via alternating updates, resolving
log-likelihood computation barriers. Furthermore, we also use the action
log-likelihood for unbiased entropy and KL divergence estimation, enabling
KL-adaptive learning rates and entropy regularization in on-policy updates.
Extensive experiments on eight IsaacLab benchmarks, including legged locomotion
(Ant, Humanoid, Anymal-D, Unitree H1, Go2), dexterous manipulation (Shadow
Hand), aerial control (Quadcopter), and robotic arm tasks (Franka), demonstrate
GenPO's superiority over existing RL baselines. Notably, GenPO is the first
method to successfully integrate diffusion policies into on-policy RL,
unlocking their potential for large-scale parallelized training and real-world
robotic deployment.

Conclusion: 揭示了当前多模态防御的系统性漏洞，为AI安全和红队研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models can inadvertently produce
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, prompting the integration of text and image
safety filters. Recent advances employ large language models (LLMs) for
semantic-level detection, rendering traditional token-level perturbation
attacks largely ineffective. However, our evaluation shows that existing
jailbreak methods are ineffective against these modern filters. We introduce
GhostPrompt, the first automated jailbreak framework that combines dynamic
prompt optimization with multimodal feedback. It consists of two key
components: (i) Dynamic Optimization, an iterative process that guides a large
language model (LLM) using feedback from text safety filters and CLIP
similarity scores to generate semantically aligned adversarial prompts; and
(ii) Adaptive Safety Indicator Injection, which formulates the injection of
benign visual cues as a reinforcement learning problem to bypass image-level
filters. GhostPrompt achieves state-of-the-art performance, increasing the
ShieldLM-7B bypass rate from 12.5\% (Sneakyprompt) to 99.0\%, improving CLIP
score from 0.2637 to 0.2762, and reducing the time cost by $4.2 \times$.
Moreover, it generalizes to unseen filters including GPT-4.1 and successfully
jailbreaks DALLE 3 to generate NSFW images in our evaluation, revealing
systemic vulnerabilities in current multimodal defenses. To support further
research on AI safety and red-teaming, we will release code and adversarial
prompts under a controlled-access protocol.

Abstract: The Influence Function (IF) is a widely used technique for assessing the
impact of individual training samples on model predictions. However, existing
IF methods often fail to provide reliable influence estimates in deep neural
networks, particularly when applied to noisy training data. This issue does not
stem from inaccuracies in parameter change estimation, which has been the
primary focus of prior research, but rather from deficiencies in loss change
estimation, specifically due to the sharpness of validation risk. In this work,
we establish a theoretical connection between influence estimation error,
validation set risk, and its sharpness, underscoring the importance of flat
validation minima for accurate influence estimation. Furthermore, we introduce
a novel estimation form of Influence Function specifically designed for flat
validation minima. Experimental results across various tasks validate the
superiority of our approach.

Conclusion: 令牌与神经元稀疏性存在协同效应，CoreMatching框架显著提升了VLMs的推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel across diverse tasks but suffer from high
inference costs in time and memory. Token sparsity mitigates inefficiencies in
token usage, while neuron sparsity reduces high-dimensional computations, both
offering promising solutions to enhance efficiency. Recently, these two
sparsity paradigms have evolved largely in parallel, fostering the prevailing
assumption that they function independently. However, a fundamental yet
underexplored question remains: Do they truly operate in isolation, or is there
a deeper underlying interplay that has yet to be uncovered? In this paper, we
conduct the first comprehensive investigation into this question. By
introducing and analyzing the matching mechanism between Core Neurons and Core
Tokens, we found that key neurons and tokens for inference mutually influence
and reinforce each other. Building on this insight, we propose CoreMatching, a
co-adaptive sparse inference framework, which leverages the synergy between
token and neuron sparsity to enhance inference efficiency. Through theoretical
analysis and efficiency evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed method
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on ten image understanding tasks and three
hardware devices. Notably, on the NVIDIA Titan Xp, it achieved 5x FLOPs
reduction and a 10x overall speedup. Code is released at

Abstract: Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL), training the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) policies with Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), have demonstrated
enhanced exploration capabilities and greater robustness than using traditional
policy gradient. However, ERL suffers from the high computational costs and low
search efficiency, as EAs require evaluating numerous candidate policies with
expensive simulations, many of which are ineffective and do not contribute
meaningfully to the training. One intuitive way to reduce the ineffective
evaluations is to adopt the surrogates. Unfortunately, existing ERL policies
are often modeled as deep neural networks (DNNs) and thus naturally represented
as high-dimensional vectors containing millions of weights, which makes the
building of effective surrogates for ERL policies extremely challenging. This
paper proposes a novel surrogate-assisted ERL that integrates Autoencoders (AE)
and Hyperbolic Neural Networks (HNN). Specifically, AE compresses
high-dimensional policies into low-dimensional representations while extracting
key features as the inputs for the surrogate. HNN, functioning as a
classification-based surrogate model, can learn complex nonlinear relationships
from sampled data and enable more accurate pre-selection of the sampled
policies without real evaluations. The experiments on 10 Atari and 4 Mujoco
games have verified that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches
significantly. The search trajectories guided by AE and HNN are also visually
demonstrated to be more effective, in terms of both exploration and
convergence. This paper not only presents the first learnable policy embedding
and surrogate-modeling modules for high-dimensional ERL policies, but also
empirically reveals when and why they can be successful.

Abstract: Training large neural networks through gradient-based optimization requires
navigating high-dimensional loss landscapes, which often exhibit pathological
geometry, leading to undesirable training dynamics. In particular, poor
generalization frequently results from convergence to sharp minima that are
highly sensitive to input perturbations, causing the model to overfit the
training data while failing to generalize to unseen examples. Furthermore,
these optimization procedures typically display strong dependence on the fine
structure of the loss landscape, leading to unstable training dynamics, due to
the fractal-like nature of the loss surface. In this work, we propose an
alternative optimizer that simultaneously reduces this dependence, and avoids
sharp minima, thereby improving generalization. This is achieved by simulating
the motion of the center of a ball rolling on the loss landscape. The degree to
which our optimizer departs from the standard gradient descent is controlled by
a hyperparameter, representing the radius of the ball. Changing this
hyperparameter allows for probing the loss landscape at different scales,
making it a valuable tool for understanding its geometry.

Conclusion: ScaleKV为VAR模型提供了一种高效的缓存压缩方案，适用于多尺度推理。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling has garnered significant attention for
its innovative next-scale prediction approach, which yields substantial
improvements in efficiency, scalability, and zero-shot generalization.
Nevertheless, the coarse-to-fine methodology inherent in VAR results in
exponential growth of the KV cache during inference, causing considerable
memory consumption and computational redundancy. To address these bottlenecks,
we introduce ScaleKV, a novel KV cache compression framework tailored for VAR
architectures. ScaleKV leverages two critical observations: varying cache
demands across transformer layers and distinct attention patterns at different
scales. Based on these insights, ScaleKV categorizes transformer layers into
two functional groups: drafters and refiners. Drafters exhibit dispersed
attention across multiple scales, thereby requiring greater cache capacity.
Conversely, refiners focus attention on the current token map to process local
details, consequently necessitating substantially reduced cache capacity.
ScaleKV optimizes the multi-scale inference pipeline by identifying
scale-specific drafters and refiners, facilitating differentiated cache
management tailored to each scale. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art
text-to-image VAR model family, Infinity, demonstrates that our approach
effectively reduces the required KV cache memory to 10% while preserving
pixel-level fidelity.

Abstract: After a period of research, deep actor-critic algorithms have reached a level
where they influence our everyday lives. They serve as the driving force behind
the continual improvement of large language models through user-collected
feedback. However, their deployment in physical systems is not yet widely
adopted, mainly because no validation scheme that quantifies their risk of
malfunction. We demonstrate that it is possible to develop tight risk
certificates for deep actor-critic algorithms that predict generalization
performance from validation-time observations. Our key insight centers on the
effectiveness of minimal evaluation data. Surprisingly, a small feasible of
evaluation roll-outs collected from a pretrained policy suffices to produce
accurate risk certificates when combined with a simple adaptation of PAC-Bayes
theory. Specifically, we adopt a recently introduced recursive PAC-Bayes
approach, which splits validation data into portions and recursively builds
PAC-Bayes bounds on the excess loss of each portion's predictor, using the
predictor from the previous portion as a data-informed prior. Our empirical
results across multiple locomotion tasks and policy expertise levels
demonstrate risk certificates that are tight enough to be considered for
practical use.

Abstract: Recent advances in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) have achieved
super-human level performance on the Atari100k benchmark, driven by
reinforcement learning agents trained on powerful diffusion world models.
However, we identify that the current aggregates mask a major performance
asymmetry: MBRL agents dramatically outperform humans in some tasks despite
drastically underperforming in others, with the former inflating the aggregate
metrics. This is especially pronounced in pixel-based agents trained with
diffusion world models. In this work, we address the pronounced asymmetry
observed in pixel-based agents as an initial attempt to reverse the worrying
upward trend observed in them. We address the problematic aggregates by
delineating all tasks as Agent-Optimal or Human-Optimal and advocate for equal
importance on metrics from both sets. Next, we hypothesize this pronounced
asymmetry is due to the lack of temporally-structured latent space trained with
the World Model objective in pixel-based methods. Lastly, to address this
issue, we propose Joint Embedding DIffusion (JEDI), a novel latent diffusion
world model trained end-to-end with the self-consistency objective. JEDI
outperforms SOTA models in human-optimal tasks while staying competitive across
the Atari100k benchmark, and runs 3 times faster with 43% lower memory than the
latest pixel-based diffusion baseline. Overall, our work rethinks what it truly

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn an effective policy from a
static dataset. To alleviate extrapolation errors, existing studies often
uniformly regularize the value function or policy updates across all states.
However, due to substantial variations in data quality, the fixed
regularization strength often leads to a dilemma: Weak regularization strength
fails to address extrapolation errors and value overestimation, while strong
regularization strength shifts policy learning toward behavior cloning,
impeding potential performance enabled by Bellman updates. To address this
issue, we propose the selective state-adaptive regularization method for
offline RL. Specifically, we introduce state-adaptive regularization
coefficients to trust state-level Bellman-driven results, while selectively
applying regularization on high-quality actions, aiming to avoid performance
degradation caused by tight constraints on low-quality actions. By establishing
a connection between the representative value regularization method, CQL, and
explicit policy constraint methods, we effectively extend selective
state-adaptive regularization to these two mainstream offline RL approaches.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in both offline and
offline-to-online settings on the D4RL benchmark.

Conclusion: 区分输入和输出特征并评分筛选，可显著提升SAE的实用性和导向效果。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been proposed as an unsupervised approach to
learn a decomposition of a model's latent space. This enables useful
applications such as steering - influencing the output of a model towards a
desired concept - without requiring labeled data. Current methods identify SAE
features to steer by analyzing the input tokens that activate them. However,
recent work has highlighted that activations alone do not fully describe the
effect of a feature on the model's output. In this work, we draw a distinction
between two types of features: input features, which mainly capture patterns in
the model's input, and output features, which have a human-understandable
effect on the model's output. We propose input and output scores to
characterize and locate these types of features, and show that high values for
both scores rarely co-occur in the same features. These findings have practical
implications: after filtering out features with low output scores, we obtain
2-3x improvements when steering with SAEs, making them competitive with
supervised methods.

Conclusion: 通过强化学习微调和约束优化，MVC-ZigAL有效平衡了T2MV生成的效率与质量。

Abstract: Text-to-multiview (T2MV) generation, which produces coherent multiview images
from a single text prompt, remains computationally intensive, while accelerated
T2MV methods using few-step diffusion models often sacrifice image fidelity and
view consistency. To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning
(RL) finetuning framework tailored for few-step T2MV diffusion models to
jointly optimize per-view fidelity and cross-view consistency. Specifically, we
first reformulate T2MV denoising across all views as a single unified Markov
decision process, enabling multiview-aware policy optimization driven by a
joint-view reward objective. Next, we introduce ZMV-Sampling, a test-time T2MV
sampling technique that adds an inversion-denoising pass to reinforce both
viewpoint and text conditioning, resulting in improved T2MV generation at the
cost of inference time. To internalize its performance gains into the base
sampling policy, we develop MV-ZigAL, a novel policy optimization strategy that
uses reward advantages of ZMV-Sampling over standard sampling as learning
signals for policy updates. Finally, noting that the joint-view reward
objective under-optimizes per-view fidelity but naively optimizing single-view
metrics neglects cross-view alignment, we reframe RL finetuning for T2MV
diffusion models as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes per-view
fidelity subject to an explicit joint-view constraint, thereby enabling more
efficient and balanced policy updates. By integrating this constrained
optimization paradigm with MV-ZigAL, we establish our complete RL finetuning
framework, referred to as MVC-ZigAL, which effectively refines the few-step
T2MV diffusion baseline in both fidelity and consistency while preserving its
few-step efficiency.

distillation literature and propose Functional Latent Alignment (FuLA) as a
novel optimality condition for model stitching. We revisit previously explored
functional similarity testbeds and introduce a new one, based on which FuLA
emerges as an overall more reliable method of functional similarity.
Specifically, our experiments in (a) adversarial training, (b) shortcut
training and, (c) cross-layer stitching, reveal that FuLA is less prone to
artifacts tied to training on task cues while achieving non-trivial alignments
that are missed by stitch-level matching.

Motivation: 理解Transformer-based CLIP模型的内部机制，尤其是潜在组件如何驱动预测，而不仅仅是它们编码的内容。

Method: 结合属性修补和语义对齐评分，自动识别与语义意外或虚假概念相关的组件，并评估其重要性。

Conclusion: 需要全面的机制可解释性方法，尤其是在线性分类器可能放大隐藏捷径的情况下。

Abstract: Transformer-based CLIP models are widely used for text-image probing and
feature extraction, making it relevant to understand the internal mechanisms
behind their predictions. While recent works show that Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) yield interpretable latent components, they focus on what these encode
and miss how they drive predictions. We introduce a scalable framework that
reveals what latent components activate for, how they align with expected
semantics, and how important they are to predictions. To achieve this, we adapt
attribution patching for instance-wise component attributions in CLIP and
highlight key faithfulness limitations of the widely used Logit Lens technique.
By combining attributions with semantic alignment scores, we can automatically
uncover reliance on components that encode semantically unexpected or spurious
concepts. Applied across multiple CLIP variants, our method uncovers hundreds
of surprising components linked to polysemous words, compound nouns, visual
typography and dataset artifacts. While text embeddings remain prone to
semantic ambiguity, they are more robust to spurious correlations compared to
linear classifiers trained on image embeddings. A case study on skin lesion
detection highlights how such classifiers can amplify hidden shortcuts,
underscoring the need for holistic, mechanistic interpretability. We provide

Motivation: 现代深度学习模型在分布内泛化能力强，但在分布外或安全关键领域需要可靠的不确定性量化。贝叶斯深度学习因先验定义和计算负担问题效果有限。

Result: 方法在分布内外任务中表现优异，无需额外超参数调优，计算开销与标准深度学习相近。

Conclusion: 隐式正则化方法为不确定性量化提供了高效解决方案，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Modern deep learning models generalize remarkably well in-distribution,
despite being overparametrized and trained with little to no explicit
regularization. Instead, current theory credits implicit regularization imposed
by the choice of architecture, hyperparameters and optimization procedure.
However, deploying deep learning models out-of-distribution, in sequential
decision-making tasks, or in safety-critical domains, necessitates reliable
uncertainty quantification, not just a point estimate. The machinery of modern
approximate inference -- Bayesian deep learning -- should answer the need for
uncertainty quantification, but its effectiveness has been challenged by our
inability to define useful explicit inductive biases through priors, as well as
the associated computational burden. Instead, in this work we demonstrate, both
theoretically and empirically, how to regularize a variational deep network
implicitly via the optimization procedure, just as for standard deep learning.
We fully characterize the inductive bias of (stochastic) gradient descent in
the case of an overparametrized linear model as generalized variational
inference and demonstrate the importance of the choice of parametrization.
Finally, we show empirically that our approach achieves strong in- and
out-of-distribution performance without tuning of additional hyperparameters
and with minimal time and memory overhead over standard deep learning.

Motivation: 多模态OOC虚假信息检测需要上下文解析，而现有方法（如LLMs）缺乏这一步骤，导致幻觉问题。本文旨在通过图结构方法解决这一问题。

Method: 构建证据图和声明图，使用GNN编码和比较两者一致性，评估图像-标题对的真实性。

Result: 提出的方法在检测任务中达到93.05%的准确率，优于第二好的LLM方法2.82%。

Conclusion: 任务专用的小规模方法在多模态虚假信息检测中表现优于通用LLMs。

Abstract: Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that
repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such
misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the
claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs
and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in
absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a
graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the
caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived
from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption.
Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations,
our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create
datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model
against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores
$93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the
second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller
and task-specific methods.

Motivation: 离线强化学习中，权重函数$w$的计算依赖于未知的行为策略，导致现有方法（如扩散模型）的计算复杂。

Method: 提出了一种同时扩散动作和权重的方法，直接从扩散模型中获取所需分数，无需额外学习网络。

Result: 在玩具示例中生成目标分布的样本，并在D4RL挑战环境中表现与最先进方法相当，同时简化了训练流程。

Conclusion: SWG方法通过自加权引导简化了权重计算，保持了高效性，并通过消融研究验证了其可扩展性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recovers the optimal policy $\pi$ given
historical observations of an agent. In practice, $\pi$ is modeled as a
weighted version of the agent's behavior policy $\mu$, using a weight function
$w$ working as a critic of the agent's behavior. Though recent approaches to
offline RL based on diffusion models have exhibited promising results, the
computation of the required scores is challenging due to their dependence on
the unknown $w$. In this work, we alleviate this issue by constructing a
diffusion over both the actions and the weights. With the proposed setting, the
required scores are directly obtained from the diffusion model without learning
extra networks. Our main conceptual contribution is a novel guidance method,
where guidance (which is a function of $w$) comes from the same diffusion
model, therefore, our proposal is termed Self-Weighted Guidance (SWG). We show
that SWG generates samples from the desired distribution on toy examples and
performs on par with state-of-the-art methods on D4RL's challenging
environments, while maintaining a streamlined training pipeline. We further
validate SWG through ablation studies on weight formulations and scalability.

Result: 实验显示FedHL在多个数据集上性能提升1-3%，并保证O(1/√T)的收敛速率。

Conclusion: FedHL解决了异构LoRA在联邦学习中的收敛问题，提升了性能和理论保证。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates the fine-tuning of Foundation Models
(FMs) using distributed data sources, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) gaining
popularity due to its low communication costs and strong performance. While
recent work acknowledges the benefits of heterogeneous LoRA in FL and
introduces flexible algorithms to support its implementation, our theoretical
analysis reveals a critical gap: existing methods lack formal convergence
guarantees due to parameter truncation and biased gradient updates.
Specifically, adapting client-specific LoRA ranks necessitates truncating
global parameters, which introduces inherent truncation errors and leads to
subsequent inaccurate gradient updates that accumulate over training rounds,
ultimately degrading performance. To address the above issues, we propose
\textbf{FedHL}, a simple yet effective \textbf{Fed}erated Learning framework
tailored for \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{L}oRA. By leveraging the full-rank
global model as a calibrated aggregation basis, FedHL eliminates the direct
truncation bias from initial alignment with client-specific ranks. Furthermore,
we derive the theoretically optimal aggregation weights by minimizing the
gradient drift term in the convergence upper bound. Our analysis shows that
FedHL guarantees $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate, and experiments on
multiple real-world datasets demonstrate a 1-3\% improvement over several
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 拉普拉斯近似是一种有效的替代方法，能够在不增加参数的情况下提供更可靠的分布估计。

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning trains a single reinforcement learning agent on a
distribution of tasks to quickly generalize to new tasks outside of the
training set at test time. From a Bayesian perspective, one can interpret this
as performing amortized variational inference on the posterior distribution
over training tasks. Among the various meta-reinforcement learning approaches,
a common method is to represent this distribution with a point-estimate using a
recurrent neural network. We show how one can augment this point estimate to
give full distributions through the Laplace approximation, either at the start
of, during, or after learning, without modifying the base model architecture.
With our approximation, we are able to estimate distribution statistics (e.g.,
the entropy) of non-Bayesian agents and observe that point-estimate based
methods produce overconfident estimators while not satisfying consistency.
Furthermore, when comparing our approach to full-distribution based learning of
the task posterior, our method performs on par with variational baselines while
having much fewer parameters.

Abstract: We study offline imitation learning (IL) in cooperative multi-agent settings,
where demonstrations have unlabeled mixed quality - containing both expert and
suboptimal trajectories. Our proposed solution is structured in two stages:
trajectory labeling and multi-agent imitation learning, designed jointly to
enable effective learning from heterogeneous, unlabeled data. In the first
stage, we combine advances in large language models and preference-based
reinforcement learning to construct a progressive labeling pipeline that
distinguishes expert-quality trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce
MisoDICE, a novel multi-agent IL algorithm that leverages these labels to learn
robust policies while addressing the computational complexity of large joint
state-action spaces. By extending the popular single-agent DICE framework to
multi-agent settings with a new value decomposition and mixing architecture,
our method yields a convex policy optimization objective and ensures
consistency between global and local policies. We evaluate MisoDICE on multiple
standard multi-agent RL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance,
especially when expert data is scarce.

Result: 实验表明CWSA和CWSA+能有效检测模型失败模式，在信任敏感测试中优于传统指标。

Conclusion: CWSA是评估和开发安全关键领域选择性预测系统的可靠基础。

Abstract: In recent machine learning systems, confidence scores are being utilized more
and more to manage selective prediction, whereby a model can abstain from
making a prediction when it is unconfident. Yet, conventional metrics like
accuracy, expected calibration error (ECE), and area under the risk-coverage
curve (AURC) do not capture the actual reliability of predictions. These
metrics either disregard confidence entirely, dilute valuable localized
information through averaging, or neglect to suitably penalize overconfident
misclassifications, which can be particularly detrimental in real-world
systems. We introduce two new metrics Confidence-Weighted Selective Accuracy
(CWSA) and its normalized variant CWSA+ that offer a principled and
interpretable way to evaluate predictive models under confidence thresholds.
Unlike existing methods, our metrics explicitly reward confident accuracy and
penalize overconfident mistakes. They are threshold-local, decomposable, and
usable in both evaluation and deployment settings where trust and risk must be
quantified. Through exhaustive experiments on both real-world data sets (MNIST,
CIFAR-10) and artificial model variants (calibrated, overconfident,
underconfident, random, perfect), we show that CWSA and CWSA+ both effectively
detect nuanced failure modes and outperform classical metrics in
trust-sensitive tests. Our results confirm that CWSA is a sound basis for
developing and assessing selective prediction systems for safety-critical
domains.

Abstract: The go-to strategy to apply deep networks in settings where uncertainty

initializations--is ill-suited for the extremely large-scale models and
practical fine-tuning workflows of today. We introduce a new cost-effective
strategy for improving the uncertainty quantification and downstream decisions
of a large model (e.g. a fine-tuned ViT-B): coupling it with a less accurate
but much smaller "sidekick" (e.g. a fine-tuned ResNet-34) with a fraction of
the computational cost. We propose aggregating the predictions of this
\emph{Asymmetric Duo} by simple learned weighted averaging. Surprisingly,
despite their inherent asymmetry, the sidekick model almost never harms the
performance of the larger model. In fact, across five image classification

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have leveraged neural

leading algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Notably, our
approach does not outperform other algorithms in terms of sample efficnency but
rather in terms of wall-clock training time. That is, although our algorithm
requires more timesteps to converge to an optimal policy, the actual time
required for training turns out to be lower.

transition of the underlying Markov decision process is subject to model
uncertainty. The uncertainty is taken into account by considering the
worst-case transition from a ball around a reference probability measure. To
determine the optimal policy under the worst-case state transition, we solve
the associated non-linear Bellman equation by dualising and regularising the
Bellman operator with the Sinkhorn distance, which is then parameterized with
deep neural networks. This approach allows us to modify the Deep Q-Network
algorithm to optimise for the worst case state transition.
  We illustrate the tractability and effectiveness of our approach through
several applications, including a portfolio optimisation task based on
S\&{P}~500 data.

Abstract: Modern policy gradient algorithms, such as TRPO and PPO, outperform vanilla
policy gradient in many RL tasks. Questioning the common belief that enforcing
approximate trust regions leads to steady policy improvement in practice, we
show that the more critical factor is the enhanced value estimation accuracy
from more value update steps in each iteration. To demonstrate, we show that by
simply increasing the number of value update steps per iteration, vanilla
policy gradient itself can achieve performance comparable to or better than PPO
in all the standard continuous control benchmark environments. Importantly,
this simple change to vanilla policy gradient is significantly more robust to
hyperparameter choices, opening up the possibility that RL algorithms may still
become more effective and easier to use.

Conclusion: RADT在复杂环境中表现出色，适用于动态避免区域任务，如生物学中的细胞重编程。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning methods have shown promise
for reach-avoid tasks, where an agent must reach a target state while avoiding
undesirable regions of the state space. Existing approaches typically encode
avoid-region information into an augmented state space and cost function, which
prevents flexible, dynamic specification of novel avoid-region information at
evaluation time. They also rely heavily on well-designed reward and cost
functions, limiting scalability to complex or poorly structured environments.
We introduce RADT, a decision transformer model for offline, reward-free,
goal-conditioned, avoid region-conditioned RL. RADT encodes goals and avoid
regions directly as prompt tokens, allowing any number of avoid regions of
arbitrary size to be specified at evaluation time. Using only suboptimal
offline trajectories from a random policy, RADT learns reach-avoid behavior
through a novel combination of goal and avoid-region hindsight relabeling. We
benchmark RADT against 3 existing offline goal-conditioned RL models across 11
tasks, environments, and experimental settings. RADT generalizes in a zero-shot
manner to out-of-distribution avoid region sizes and counts, outperforming
baselines that require retraining. In one such zero-shot setting, RADT achieves
35.7% improvement in normalized cost over the best retrained baseline while
maintaining high goal-reaching success. We apply RADT to cell reprogramming in
biology, where it reduces visits to undesirable intermediate gene expression
states during trajectories to desired target states, despite stochastic
transitions and discrete, structured state dynamics.

to target distribution samples presents a significant challenge. A critical
desideratum in these settings is achieving comprehensive mode coverage,
ensuring the sampler captures the full diversity of the target distribution.
However, prevailing methods often circumvent the lack of target data by
optimizing reverse KL-based objectives. Such objectives inherently exhibit
mode-seeking behavior, potentially leading to incomplete representation of the
underlying distribution. While alternative approaches strive for better mode
coverage, they typically rely on implicit mechanisms like heuristics or
iterative refinement. In this work, we propose a principled approach for
training diffusion-based samplers by directly targeting an objective analogous
to the forward KL divergence, which is conceptually known to encourage mode
coverage. We introduce \textit{Importance Weighted Score Matching}, a method
that optimizes this desired mode-covering objective by re-weighting the score
matching loss using tractable importance sampling estimates, thereby overcoming
the absence of target distribution data. We also provide theoretical analysis
of the bias and variance for our proposed Monte Carlo estimator and the
practical loss function used in our method. Experiments on increasingly complex
multi-modal distributions, including 2D Gaussian Mixture Models with up to 120
modes and challenging particle systems with inherent symmetries -- demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms existing neural samplers across all
distributional distance metrics, achieving state-of-the-art results on all
benchmarks.

Abstract: Joint Energy-based Models (JEMs), a class of hybrid generative-discriminative
models, are well known for their ability to achieve both high classification
accuracy and generative capability within a single model. However, their
robustness still lags significantly behind the classifiers based adversarial
training (AT). Conversely, while AT is currently the most effective approach to
improving the classifier's robustness, it typically sacrifices accuracy on
clean data and lacks generative capability. The triple trade-off between
classification accuracy, generative capability and robustness, raises a natural
question: Can a single model simultaneously achieve high classification
accuracy, adversarial robustness, and generative performance? -- a goal that
has been rarely explored. To address this question, we systematically analyze
the energy distribution differences of clean, adversarial, and generated
samples across various JEM variants and adversarially trained models. We
observe that AT tends to reduce the energy gap between clean and adversarial
samples, while JEMs reduce the gap between clean and synthetic ones. This
observation suggests a key insight: if the energy distributions of all three
data types can be aligned, we might unify the strengths of AT and JEMs,
resolving their inherent trade-offs. Building on this idea, we propose
Energy-based Joint Distribution Adversarial Training (EB-JDAT), to jointly
model the clean data distribution, the adversarial distribution, and the
classifier by maximizing their joint probability. EB-JDAT is a general and
flexible optimization method, compatible with various JEM variants. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that EB-JDAT not only maintains near original
accuracy and generative capability of JEMs, but also significantly enhances
robustness, even surpassing state-of-the-art ATs.

Result: 当前多模态模型能识别知识冲突，但倾向于依赖内部参数知识而非外部证据。

Conclusion: MMKC-Bench有助于推动多模态知识冲突研究，提升多模态RAG系统的发展。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models(LMMs) face notable challenges when encountering
multimodal knowledge conflicts, particularly under retrieval-augmented
generation(RAG) frameworks where the contextual information from external
sources may contradict the model's internal parametric knowledge, leading to
unreliable outputs. However, existing benchmarks fail to reflect such realistic
conflict scenarios. Most focus solely on intra-memory conflicts, while
context-memory and inter-context conflicts remain largely investigated.
Furthermore, commonly used factual knowledge-based evaluations are often
overlooked, and existing datasets lack a thorough investigation into conflict
detection capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose MMKC-Bench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate factual knowledge conflicts in both context-memory and
inter-context scenarios. MMKC-Bench encompasses three types of multimodal
knowledge conflicts and includes 1,573 knowledge instances and 3,381 images
across 23 broad types, collected through automated pipelines with human
verification. We evaluate three representative series of LMMs on both model
behavior analysis and conflict detection tasks. Our findings show that while
current LMMs are capable of recognizing knowledge conflicts, they tend to favor
internal parametric knowledge over external evidence. We hope MMKC-Bench will
foster further research in multimodal knowledge conflict and enhance the
development of multimodal RAG systems. The source code is available at

Abstract: The current state-of-the-art backdoor attacks against Reinforcement Learning
(RL) rely upon unrealistically permissive access models, that assume the
attacker can read (or even write) the victim's policy parameters, observations,
or rewards. In this work, we question whether such a strong assumption is
required to launch backdoor attacks against RL. To answer this question, we
propose the \underline{S}upply-\underline{C}h\underline{a}in
\underline{B}ackdoor (SCAB) attack, which targets a common RL workflow:
training agents using external agents that are provided separately or embedded
within the environment. In contrast to prior works, our attack only relies on
legitimate interactions of the RL agent with the supplied agents. Despite this
limited access model, by poisoning a mere $3\%$ of training experiences, our
attack can successfully activate over $90\%$ of triggered actions, reducing the
average episodic return by $80\%$ for the victim. Our novel attack demonstrates
that RL attacks are likely to become a reality under untrusted RL training
supply-chains.

Abstract: Low Rank Decomposition (LRD) is a model compression technique applied to the
weight tensors of deep learning models in order to reduce the number of
trainable parameters and computational complexity. However, due to high number
of new layers added to the architecture after applying LRD, it may not lead to
a high training/inference acceleration if the decomposition ranks are not small
enough. The issue is that using small ranks increases the risk of significant
accuracy drop after decomposition. In this paper, we propose two techniques for
accelerating low rank decomposed models without requiring to use small ranks
for decomposition. These methods include rank optimization and sequential
freezing of decomposed layers. We perform experiments on both convolutional and
transformer-based models. Experiments show that these techniques can improve
the model throughput up to 60% during training and 37% during inference when
combined together while preserving the accuracy close to that of the original
models

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing education, with LLM-based
agents playing a key role in simulating student behavior. A major challenge in
student simulation is modeling the diverse learning patterns of students at
various cognitive levels. However, current LLMs, typically trained as ``helpful
assistants'', target at generating perfect responses. As a result, they
struggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often
produce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that
characterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To
address this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student
simulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student
using a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from
past learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict
student performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these
predictions and iteratively refine them using a beam search method to better
replicate realistic mistakes. To validate our approach, we construct the
\texttt{Student\_100} dataset, consisting of $100$ students working on Python
programming and $5,000$ learning records. Experimental results show that our
method consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving $100\%$ improvement
in simulation accuracy.

as a sequential decision process, where each step adds or removes a single
drug. To provide fine-grained learning signals, we devise step-wise Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with potential-based reward shaping, which
explicitly models DDIs and optimizes the contribution of each drug to the
overall prescription. Furthermore, FLAME enhances patient modeling by
integrating structured clinical knowledge and collaborative information into
the representation space of LLMs. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that FLAME achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior accuracy,
controllable safety-accuracy trade-offs, and strong generalization across

Conclusion: RedAHD展示了LLMs在完全端到端启发式设计中的潜力，为COPs的自动化解决提供了新思路。

Abstract: Solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) (e.g., traveling
salesman problems (TSPs) and capacitated vehicle routing problems (CVRPs)) in
practice traditionally involves handcrafting heuristics or specifying a search
space for finding effective heuristics. The main challenges from these
approaches, however, are the sheer amount of domain knowledge and
implementation efforts required from human experts. Recently, significant
progress has been made to address these challenges, particularly by using large
language models (LLMs) to design heuristics within some predetermined
generalized algorithmic framework (GAF, e.g., ant colony optimization and
guided local search) for building key functions/components (e.g., a priori
information on how promising it is to include each edge in a solution for TSP
and CVRP). Although existing methods leveraging this idea have shown to yield
impressive optimization performance, they are not fully end-to-end and still
require considerable manual interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel
end-to-end framework, named RedAHD, that enables these LLM-based heuristic
design methods to operate without the need of GAFs. More specifically, RedAHD
employs LLMs to automate the process of reduction, i.e., transforming the COP
at hand into similar COPs that are better-understood, from which LLM-based
heuristic design methods can design effective heuristics for directly solving
the transformed COPs and, in turn, indirectly solving the original COP. Our
experimental results, evaluated on six COPs, show that RedAHD is capable of
designing heuristics with competitive or improved results over the
state-of-the-art methods with minimal human involvement.

Abstract: Humanoid locomotion faces a critical scalability challenge: traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) methods require task-specific rewards and struggle
to leverage growing datasets, even as more training terrains are introduced. We
propose DreamPolicy, a unified framework that enables a single policy to master
diverse terrains and generalize zero-shot to unseen scenarios by systematically
integrating offline data and diffusion-driven motion synthesis. At its core,
DreamPolicy introduces Humanoid Motion Imagery (HMI) - future state predictions
synthesized through an autoregressive terrain-aware diffusion planner curated
by aggregating rollouts from specialized policies across various distinct
terrains. Unlike human motion datasets requiring laborious retargeting, our
data directly captures humanoid kinematics, enabling the diffusion planner to
synthesize "dreamed" trajectories that encode terrain-specific physical
constraints. These trajectories act as dynamic objectives for our
HMI-conditioned policy, bypassing manual reward engineering and enabling
cross-terrain generalization. DreamPolicy addresses the scalability limitations
of prior methods: while traditional RL fails to exploit growing datasets, our
framework scales seamlessly with more offline data. As the dataset expands, the
diffusion prior learns richer locomotion skills, which the policy leverages to
master new terrains without retraining. Experiments demonstrate that
DreamPolicy achieves average 90% success rates in training environments and an
average of 20% higher success on unseen terrains than the prevalent method. It
also generalizes to perturbed and composite scenarios where prior approaches
collapse. By unifying offline data, diffusion-based trajectory synthesis, and
policy optimization, DreamPolicy overcomes the "one task, one policy"
bottleneck, establishing a paradigm for scalable, data-driven humanoid control.

Abstract: Safety stands as the primary obstacle preventing the widespread adoption of
learning-based robotic systems in our daily lives. While reinforcement learning
(RL) shows promise as an effective robot learning paradigm, conventional RL
frameworks often model safety by using single scalar negative rewards with
immediate episode termination, failing to capture the temporal consequences of
unsafe actions (e.g., sustained collision damage). In this work, we introduce a
novel approach that simulates these temporal effects by applying continuous
negative rewards without episode termination. Our experiments reveal that
standard RL methods struggle with this model, as the accumulated negative
values in unsafe zones create learning barriers. To address this challenge, we
demonstrate how Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), with their proven safety
guarantees, effectively help robots avoid catastrophic regions while enhancing
learning outcomes. We present three CBF-based approaches, each integrating
traditional RL methods with Control Barrier Functions, guiding the agent to
learn safe behavior. Our empirical analysis, conducted in both simulated
environments and real-world settings using a four-wheel differential drive
robot, explores the possibilities of employing these approaches for safe
robotic learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces marginal fairness, a new individual fairness notion for
equitable decision-making in the presence of protected attributes such as
gender, race, and religion. This criterion ensures that decisions based on
generalized distortion risk measures are insensitive to distributional
perturbations in protected attributes, regardless of whether these attributes
are continuous, discrete, categorical, univariate, or multivariate. To
operationalize this notion and reflect real-world regulatory environments (such
as the EU gender-neutral pricing regulation), we model business decision-making
in highly regulated industries (such as insurance and finance) as a two-step
process: (i) a predictive modeling stage, in which a prediction function for
the target variable (e.g., insurance losses) is estimated based on both
protected and non-protected covariates; and (ii) a decision-making stage, in
which a generalized distortion risk measure is applied to the target variable,
conditional only on non-protected covariates, to determine the decision. In
this second step, we modify the risk measure such that the decision becomes
insensitive to the protected attribute, thus enforcing fairness to ensure
equitable outcomes under risk-sensitive, regulatory constraints. Furthermore,
by utilizing the concept of cascade sensitivity, we extend the marginal
fairness framework to capture how dependencies between covariates propagate the
influence of protected attributes through the modeling pipeline. A numerical
study and an empirical implementation using an auto insurance dataset
demonstrate how the framework can be applied in practice.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong
zero-shot performance across diverse downstream text-image tasks. Existing CLIP

scalability challenges with very large datasets. To overcome these limitations,
we propose AmorLIP, an efficient CLIP pretraining framework that amortizes
expensive computations involved in contrastive learning through lightweight
neural networks, which substantially improves training efficiency and
performance. Leveraging insights from a spectral factorization of energy-based
models, we introduce novel amortization objectives along with practical
techniques to improve training stability. Extensive experiments across 38
downstream tasks demonstrate the superior zero-shot classification and

baselines with substantial relative improvements of up to 12.24%.

Abstract: Facial emotion perception in the vision large language model (VLLM) is
crucial for achieving natural human-machine interaction. However, creating
high-quality annotations for both coarse- and fine-grained facial emotion
analysis demands costly expertise. The lack of such high-quality instruction
data limits the performance of VLLMs in facial emotion perception. To address
this, we propose a self-verification approach with emotion knowledge
enhancement (SEKE), which generates high-quality instruction data for
multi-grained emotion analysis cost-effectively using closed-source VLLM. This
approach integrates prior human knowledge to VLLM inference, guided by the
inherent correlations between three grained levels of emotion descriptions,
i.e., discrete expression, valence-arousal, and action unit, to reliably
generate comprehensive annotations. A self-verification strategy with
Uncertainty-Aware Monte Carlo sampling (SV-UAMC) is further embedded to
efficiently extract more accurate VLLM predictions, further improving
annotation reliability. Consequently, we construct a facial emotion instruction
dataset (FEID) containing three comprehensive descriptions, which provides
coarse- and fine-grained emotional information for effective model training.
Additionally, we introduce a facial emotion analysis benchmark (FEAB) to
measure the VLLM's corresponding ability. Our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on three downstream facial emotion analysis tasks.

Abstract: What is the shortest path between two data points lying in a high-dimensional
space? While the answer is trivial in Euclidean geometry, it becomes
significantly more complex when the data lies on a curved manifold -- requiring
a Riemannian metric to describe the space's local curvature. Estimating such a
metric, however, remains a major challenge in high dimensions.
  In this work, we propose a method for deriving Riemannian metrics directly
from pretrained Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- a class of generative models that
assign low energy to high-density regions. These metrics define spatially
varying distances, enabling the computation of geodesics -- shortest paths that
follow the data manifold's intrinsic geometry. We introduce two novel metrics
derived from EBMs and show that they produce geodesics that remain closer to
the data manifold and exhibit lower curvature distortion, as measured by
alignment with ground-truth trajectories. We evaluate our approach on
increasingly complex datasets: synthetic datasets with known data density,
rotated character images with interpretable geometry, and high-resolution
natural images embedded in a pretrained VAE latent space.
  Our results show that EBM-derived metrics consistently outperform established
baselines, especially in high-dimensional settings. Our work is the first to
derive Riemannian metrics from EBMs, enabling data-aware geodesics and
unlocking scalable, geometry-driven learning for generative modeling and
simulation.

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (RL) concerns agents that are expected to
learn continually, rather than converge to a policy that is then fixed for
evaluation. Such an approach is well suited to environments the agent perceives
as changing, which renders any static policy ineffective over time. The few
simulators explicitly designed for empirical research in continual RL are often
limited in scope or complexity, and it is now common for researchers to modify
episodic RL environments by artificially incorporating abrupt task changes
during interaction. In this paper, we introduce AgarCL, a research platform for
continual RL that allows for a progression of increasingly sophisticated
behaviour. AgarCL is based on the game Agar.io, a non-episodic,
high-dimensional problem featuring stochastic, ever-evolving dynamics,
continuous actions, and partial observability. Additionally, we provide
benchmark results reporting the performance of DQN, PPO, and SAC in both the
primary, challenging continual RL problem, and across a suite of smaller tasks
within AgarCL, each of which isolates aspects of the full environment and allow
us to characterize the challenges posed by different aspects of the game.

Result: 证明从随机策略中采样的动作本身具有DP，提供了一种新的隐私保护途径。

Conclusion: KL正则化是实现DP的有效方法，无需额外噪声，同时保持性能。

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework for privacy, ensuring
the outputs of data-driven algorithms remain statistically indistinguishable
across datasets that differ in a single entry. While guaranteeing DP generally
requires explicitly injecting noise either to the algorithm itself or to its
outputs, the intrinsic randomness of existing algorithms presents an
opportunity to achieve DP ``for free''. In this work, we explore the role of
regularization in achieving DP across three different decision-making problems:
multi-armed bandits, linear contextual bandits, and reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF), in offline data settings. We show that adding
KL-regularization to the learning objective (a common approach in optimization
algorithms) makes the action sampled from the resulting stochastic policy
itself differentially private. This offers a new route to privacy guarantees
without additional noise injection, while also preserving the inherent
advantage of regularization in enhancing performance.

Abstract: Actor-critic methods for decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) facilitate collaborative optimal decision making without centralized
coordination, thus enabling a wide range of applications in practice. To date,
however, most theoretical convergence studies for existing actor-critic
decentralized MARL methods are limited to the guarantee of a stationary
solution under the linear function approximation. This leaves a significant gap
between the highly successful use of deep neural actor-critic for decentralized
MARL in practice and the current theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap,
in this paper, we make the first attempt to develop a deep neural actor-critic
method for decentralized MARL, where both the actor and critic components are
inherently non-linear. We show that our proposed method enjoys a global
optimality guarantee with a finite-time convergence rate of O(1/T), where T is
the total iteration times. This marks the first global convergence result for
deep neural actor-critic methods in the MARL literature. We also conduct
extensive numerical experiments, which verify our theoretical results.

Conclusion: Prime通过部分掩码设计显著提升了MDM的效率和性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDM) are powerful generative models for discrete
data that generate samples by progressively unmasking tokens in a sequence.
Each token can take one of two states: masked or unmasked. We observe that
token sequences often remain unchanged between consecutive sampling steps;
consequently, the model repeatedly processes identical inputs, leading to
redundant computation. To address this inefficiency, we propose the Partial
masking scheme (Prime), which augments MDM by allowing tokens to take
intermediate states interpolated between the masked and unmasked states. This
design enables the model to make predictions based on partially observed token
information, and facilitates a fine-grained denoising process. We derive a
variational training objective and introduce a simple architectural design to
accommodate intermediate-state inputs. Our method demonstrates superior
performance across a diverse set of generative modeling tasks. On text data, it
achieves a perplexity of 15.36 on OpenWebText, outperforming previous MDM
(21.52), autoregressive models (17.54), and their hybrid variants (17.58),
without relying on an autoregressive formulation. On image data, it attains
competitive FID scores of 3.26 on CIFAR-10 and 6.98 on ImageNet-32, comparable

Abstract: Deep learning models perform poorly when domain shifts exist between training
and test data. Test-time adaptation (TTA) is a paradigm to mitigate this issue
by adapting pre-trained models using only unlabeled test samples. However,
existing TTA methods can fail under severe domain shifts, while recent active
TTA approaches requiring full-class labels are impractical due to high labeling
costs. To address this issue, we introduce a new setting of TTA with binary
feedback. This setting uses a few binary feedback inputs from annotators to
indicate whether model predictions are correct, thereby significantly reducing
the labeling burden of annotators. Under the setting, we propose BiTTA, a novel
dual-path optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to
balance binary feedback-guided adaptation on uncertain samples with
agreement-based self-adaptation on confident predictions. Experiments show
BiTTA achieves 13.3%p accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating its effectiveness in handling severe distribution shifts with
minimal labeling effort. The source code is available at

Abstract: The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a key metric for classification,
especially under class imbalance, with growing research focus on optimizing AUC
over accuracy in applications like medical image analysis and deepfake
detection. This leads to fairness in AUC optimization becoming crucial as
biases can impact protected groups. While various fairness mitigation
techniques exist, fairness considerations in AUC optimization remain in their
early stages, with most research focusing on improving AUC fairness under the
assumption of clean protected groups. However, these studies often overlook the
impact of noisy protected groups, leading to fairness violations in practice.
To address this, we propose the first robust AUC fairness approach under noisy
protected groups with fairness theoretical guarantees using distributionally
robust optimization. Extensive experiments on tabular and image datasets show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in preserving AUC
fairness. The code is in

Conclusion: LwI框架通过路径保护而非参数保护，实现了参数高效的持续学习。

Abstract: Deep networks are prone to catastrophic forgetting during sequential task
learning, i.e., losing the knowledge about old tasks upon learning new tasks.
To this end, continual learning(CL) has emerged, whose existing methods focus
mostly on regulating or protecting the parameters associated with the previous
tasks. However, parameter protection is often impractical, since the size of
parameters for storing the old-task knowledge increases linearly with the
number of tasks, otherwise it is hard to preserve the parameters related to the
old-task knowledge. In this work, we bring a dual opinion from neuroscience and
physics to CL: in the whole networks, the pathways matter more than the
parameters when concerning the knowledge acquired from the old tasks. Following
this opinion, we propose a novel CL framework, learning without isolation(LwI),
where model fusion is formulated as graph matching and the pathways occupied by
the old tasks are protected without being isolated. Thanks to the sparsity of
activation channels in a deep network, LwI can adaptively allocate available
pathways for a new task, realizing pathway protection and addressing
catastrophic forgetting in a parameter-efficient manner. Experiments on popular
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LwI.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, as a post-hoc processing technique, has gained widespread
adoption in addressing challenges like bias mitigation and robustness
enhancement, colloquially, machine unlearning for fairness and robustness.
However, existing non-privacy unlearning-based solutions persist in using
binary data removal framework designed for privacy-driven motivation, leading
to significant information loss, a phenomenon known as over-unlearning. While
over-unlearning has been largely described in many studies as primarily causing
utility degradation, we investigate its fundamental causes and provide deeper
insights in this work through counterfactual leave-one-out analysis. In this
paper, we introduce a weighted influence function that assigns tailored weights
to each sample by solving a convex quadratic programming problem analytically.
Building on this, we propose a soft-weighted framework enabling fine-grained
model adjustments to address the over-unlearning challenge. We demonstrate that
the proposed soft-weighted scheme is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated
into most existing unlearning algorithms. Extensive experiments show that in
fairness- and robustness-driven tasks, the soft-weighted scheme significantly
outperforms hard-weighted schemes in fairness/robustness metrics and alleviates
the decline in utility metric, thereby enhancing machine unlearning algorithm
as an effective correction solution.

Abstract: Visual encoders have become fundamental components in modern computer vision
pipelines. However, ensuring robustness against adversarial perturbations
remains a critical challenge. Recent efforts have explored both supervised and
unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning strategies. We identify two key
limitations in these approaches: (i) they often suffer from instability,
especially during the early stages of fine-tuning, resulting in suboptimal
convergence and degraded performance on clean data, and (ii) they exhibit a
suboptimal trade-off between robustness and clean data accuracy, hindering the
simultaneous optimization of both objectives. To overcome these challenges, we
propose Lagrangian-Optimized Robust Embeddings (LORE), a novel unsupervised
adversarial fine-tuning framework. LORE utilizes constrained optimization,
which offers a principled approach to balancing competing goals, such as
improving robustness while preserving nominal performance. By enforcing
embedding-space proximity constraints, LORE effectively maintains clean data
performance throughout adversarial fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that
LORE significantly improves zero-shot adversarial robustness with minimal
degradation in clean data accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the adversarially fine-tuned CLIP image encoder in
out-of-distribution generalization and enhancing the interpretability of image
embeddings.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn an optimal policy from
pre-collected data. However, it faces challenges of distributional shift, where
the learned policy may encounter unseen scenarios not covered in the offline
data. Additionally, numerous applications suffer from a scarcity of labeled
reward data. Relying on labeled data alone often leads to a narrow state-action
distribution, further amplifying the distributional shift, and resulting in
suboptimal policy learning. To address these issues, we first recognize that
the volume of unlabeled data is typically substantially larger than that of
labeled data. We then propose a semi-pessimistic RL method to effectively
leverage abundant unlabeled data. Our approach offers several advantages. It
considerably simplifies the learning process, as it seeks a lower bound of the
reward function, rather than that of the Q-function or state transition
function. It is highly flexible, and can be integrated with a range of
model-free and model-based RL algorithms. It enjoys the guaranteed improvement
when utilizing vast unlabeled data, but requires much less restrictive
conditions. We compare our method with a number of alternative solutions, both
analytically and numerically, and demonstrate its clear competitiveness. We
further illustrate with an application to adaptive deep brain stimulation for
Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Modality fusion is a cornerstone of multimodal learning, enabling information
integration from diverse data sources. However, vanilla fusion methods are
limited by (1) inability to account for heterogeneous interactions between
modalities and (2) lack of interpretability in uncovering the multimodal
interactions inherent in the data. To this end, we propose I2MoE (Interpretable
Multimodal Interaction-aware Mixture of Experts), an end-to-end MoE framework
designed to enhance modality fusion by explicitly modeling diverse multimodal
interactions, as well as providing interpretation on a local and global level.
First, I2MoE utilizes different interaction experts with weakly supervised
interaction losses to learn multimodal interactions in a data-driven way.
Second, I2MoE deploys a reweighting model that assigns importance scores for
the output of each interaction expert, which offers sample-level and
dataset-level interpretation. Extensive evaluation of medical and general
multimodal datasets shows that I2MoE is flexible enough to be combined with
different fusion techniques, consistently improves task performance, and
provides interpretation across various real-world scenarios. Code is available

Abstract: Adversarial attack reveals the vulnerability of deep learning models. For
about a decade, countless attack and defense methods have been proposed,
leading to robustified classifiers and better understanding of models. Among
these methods, curvature-based approaches have attracted attention because it
is assumed that high curvature may give rise to rough decision boundary.
However, the most commonly used \textit{curvature} is the curvature of loss
function, scores or other parameters from within the model as opposed to
decision boundary curvature, since the former can be relatively easily formed
using second order derivative. In this paper, we propose a new query-efficient
method, dynamic curvature estimation(DCE), to estimate the decision boundary
curvature in a black-box setting. Our approach is based on CGBA, a black-box
adversarial attack. By performing DCE on a wide range of classifiers, we
discovered, statistically, a connection between decision boundary curvature and
adversarial robustness. We also propose a new attack method, curvature dynamic
black-box attack(CDBA) with improved performance using the dynamically
estimated curvature.

Abstract: Constrained decision-making is essential for designing safe policies in
real-world control systems, yet simulated environments often fail to capture
real-world adversities. We consider the problem of learning a policy that will
maximize the cumulative reward while satisfying a constraint, even when there
is a mismatch between the real model and an accessible simulator/nominal model.
In particular, we consider the robust constrained Markov decision problem
(RCMDP) where an agent needs to maximize the reward and satisfy the constraint
against the worst possible stochastic model under the uncertainty set centered
around an unknown nominal model. Primal-dual methods, effective for standard
constrained MDP (CMDP), are not applicable here because of the lack of the
strong duality property. Further, one cannot apply the standard robust
value-iteration based approach on the composite value function either as the
worst case models may be different for the reward value function and the
constraint value function. We propose a novel technique that effectively
minimizes the constraint value function--to satisfy the constraints; on the
other hand, when all the constraints are satisfied, it can simply maximize the
robust reward value function. We prove that such an algorithm finds a policy
with at most $\epsilon$ sub-optimality and feasible policy after
$O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. In contrast to the state-of-the-art method, we
do not need to employ a binary search, thus, we reduce the computation time by
at least 4x for smaller value of discount factor ($\gamma$) and by at least 6x
for larger value of $\gamma$.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in quality and complexity of the generations in
text-to-image models, prompting does not always lead to the desired outputs.
Controlling model behaviour by directly steering intermediate model activations
has emerged as a viable alternative allowing to reach concepts in latent space
that may otherwise remain inaccessible by prompt. In this work, we introduce a
set of experiments to deepen our understanding of concept reachability. We
design a training data setup with three key obstacles: scarcity of concepts,
underspecification of concepts in the captions, and data biases with tied
concepts. Our results show: (i) concept reachability in latent space exhibits a
distinct phase transition, with only a small number of samples being sufficient
to enable reachability, (ii) where in the latent space the intervention is
performed critically impacts reachability, showing that certain concepts are
reachable only at certain stages of transformation, and (iii) while prompting
ability rapidly diminishes with a decrease in quality of the dataset, concepts
often remain reliably reachable through steering. Model providers can leverage
this to bypass costly retraining and dataset curation and instead innovate with
user-facing control mechanisms.

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计更鲁棒的预测系统提供了指导，并评估了TSFMs的对抗性鲁棒性。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), which are pretrained on large-scale,
cross-domain data and capable of zero-shot forecasting in new scenarios without
further training, are increasingly adopted in real-world applications. However,
as the zero-shot forecasting paradigm gets popular, a critical yet overlooked
question emerges: Are TSFMs robust to adversarial input perturbations? Such
perturbations could be exploited in man-in-the-middle attacks or data
poisoning. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic investigation into the
adversarial robustness of TSFMs. Our results show that even minimal
perturbations can induce significant and controllable changes in forecast
behaviors, including trend reversal, temporal drift, and amplitude shift,
posing serious risks to TSFM-based services. Through experiments on
representative TSFMs and multiple datasets, we reveal their consistent
vulnerabilities and identify potential architectural designs, such as
structural sparsity and multi-task pretraining, that may improve robustness.
Our findings offer actionable guidance for designing more resilient forecasting
systems and provide a critical assessment of the adversarial robustness of
TSFMs.

Abstract: With the recent success of world-model agents, which extend the core idea of
model-based reinforcement learning by learning a differentiable model for
sample-efficient control across diverse tasks, active inference (AIF) offers a
complementary, neuroscience-grounded paradigm that unifies perception,
learning, and action within a single probabilistic framework powered by a
generative model. Despite this promise, practical AIF agents still rely on
accurate immediate predictions and exhaustive planning, a limitation that is
exacerbated in delayed environments requiring plans over long horizons, tens to
hundreds of steps. Moreover, most existing agents are evaluated on robotic or
vision benchmarks which, while natural for biological agents, fall short of
real-world industrial complexity. We address these limitations with a
generative-policy architecture featuring (i) a multi-step latent transition
that lets the generative model predict an entire horizon in a single
look-ahead, (ii) an integrated policy network that enables the transition and
receives gradients of the expected free energy, (iii) an alternating
optimization scheme that updates model and policy from a replay buffer, and
(iv) a single gradient step that plans over long horizons, eliminating
exhaustive planning from the control loop. We evaluate our agent in an
environment that mimics a realistic industrial scenario with delayed and
long-horizon settings. The empirical results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, demonstrating the coupled world-model with the AIF formalism
yields an end-to-end probabilistic controller capable of effective decision
making in delayed, long-horizon settings without handcrafted rewards or
expensive planning.

Conclusion: 该框架结合了预测准确性和解释性，为临床诊断提供了透明且可信的支持。

Abstract: The differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias is a challenging
clinical task, mainly because of the overlap in symptom presentation and the
similarity of patterns observed in structural neuroimaging. To improve
diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, deep learning-based methods such as
Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers have been proposed for
the automatic classification of brain MRIs. However, despite their strong
predictive performance, these models find limited clinical utility due to their
opaque decision making. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates
two core components to enhance diagnostic transparency. First, we introduce a
modular pipeline for converting 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs into textual
radiology reports. Second, we explore the potential of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs) to assist clinicians in the differential diagnosis between
Frontotemporal dementia subtypes, Alzheimer's disease, and normal aging based
on the generated reports. To bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and
explainability, we employ reinforcement learning to incentivize diagnostic
reasoning in LLMs. Without requiring supervised reasoning traces or
distillation from larger models, our approach enables the emergence of
structured diagnostic rationales grounded in neuroimaging findings. Unlike
post-hoc explainability methods that retrospectively justify model decisions,
our framework generates diagnostic rationales as part of the inference
process-producing causally grounded explanations that inform and guide the
model's decision-making process. In doing so, our framework matches the
diagnostic performance of existing deep learning methods while offering
rationales that support its diagnostic conclusions.

Abstract: Hollmann et al. (Nature 637 (2025) 319-326) recently introduced TabPFN, a
transformer-based deep learning model for regression and classification on
tabular data, which they claim "outperforms all previous methods on datasets
with up to 10,000 samples by a wide margin, using substantially less training
time." Furthermore, they have called TabPFN a "foundation model" for tabular
data, as it can support "data generation, density estimation, learning reusable
embeddings and fine-tuning". If these statements are well-supported, TabPFN may
have the potential to supersede existing modeling approaches on a wide range of
statistical tasks, mirroring a similar revolution in other areas of artificial
intelligence that began with the advent of large language models. In this
paper, we provide a tailored explanation of how TabPFN works for a statistics
audience, by emphasizing its interpretation as approximate Bayesian inference.
We also provide more evidence of TabPFN's "foundation model" capabilities: We
show that an out-of-the-box application of TabPFN vastly outperforms
specialized state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised parameter estimation,
prediction under covariate shift, and heterogeneous treatment effect
estimation. We further show that TabPFN can outperform LASSO at sparse
regression and can break a robustness-efficiency trade-off in classification.

Conclusion: Koopman-based Transformer是一种在复杂现实条件下实现稳健、可解释时间序列预测的有前景的混合方法。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as energy,
finance, and healthcare, where accurate predictions inform decision-making
under uncertainty. Although Transformer-based models have demonstrated success
in sequential modeling, their adoption for time series remains limited by
challenges such as noise sensitivity, long-range dependencies, and a lack of
inductive bias for temporal structure. In this work, we present a unified and
principled framework for benchmarking three prominent Transformer forecasting
architectures-Autoformer, Informer, and Patchtst-each evaluated through three
architectural variants: Minimal, Standard, and Full, representing increasing
levels of complexity and modeling capacity.
  We conduct over 1500 controlled experiments on a suite of ten synthetic
signals, spanning five patch lengths and five forecast horizons under both
clean and noisy conditions. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across
model families.
  To advance this landscape further, we introduce the Koopman-enhanced
Transformer framework, Deep Koopformer, which integrates operator-theoretic
latent state modeling to improve stability and interpretability. We demonstrate
its efficacy on nonlinear and chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight
Koopman based Transformer as a promising hybrid approach for robust,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded time series forecasting in noisy and

Conclusion: TD-GFN提供了一种高效可靠的代理无关训练框架。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a promising class of generative
models designed to sample diverse, high-reward structures by modeling
distributions over compositional objects. In many real-world applications,
obtaining the reward function for such objects is expensive, time-consuming, or
requires human input, making it necessary to train GFlowNets from historical
datasets. Most existing methods adopt a model-based approach, learning a proxy
model from the dataset to approximate the reward function. However, this
strategy inherently ties the quality of the learned policy to the accuracy of
the proxy, introducing additional complexity and uncertainty into the training
process. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Trajectory-Distilled
GFlowNet (TD-GFN)}, a \emph{proxy-free} training framework that eliminates the
need for out-of-dataset reward queries. Our method is motivated by the key
observation that different edges in the associated directed acyclic graph (DAG)
contribute unequally to effective policy learning. TD-GFN leverages inverse
reinforcement learning to estimate edge-level rewards from the offline dataset,
which are then used to ingeniously prune the DAG and guide backward trajectory
sampling during training. This approach directs the policy toward high-reward
regions while reducing the complexity of model fitting. Empirical results
across multiple tasks show that TD-GFN trains both efficiently and reliably,
significantly outperforming existing baselines in convergence speed and sample
quality.

Abstract: Predictive Coding (PC) offers a biologically plausible alternative to
backpropagation for neural network training, yet struggles with deeper
architectures. This paper identifies the root cause: an inherent signal decay
problem where gradients attenuate exponentially with depth, becoming
computationally negligible due to numerical precision constraints. To address
this fundamental limitation, we introduce Error Optimization (EO), a novel
reparameterization that preserves PC's theoretical properties while eliminating
signal decay. By optimizing over prediction errors rather than states, EO
enables signals to reach all layers simultaneously and without attenuation,
converging orders of magnitude faster than standard PC. Experiments across
multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that EO matches
backpropagation's performance even for deeper models where conventional PC
struggles. Besides practical improvements, our work provides theoretical
insight into PC dynamics and establishes a foundation for scaling
biologically-inspired learning to deeper architectures on digital hardware and
beyond.

Matching (GFM), a continuous-time modeling framework that treats neural network
training as a dynamical system governed by learned optimizer-aware vector

update rules of optimizers such as SGD, Adam, and RMSprop, enabling smooth
extrapolation of weight trajectories toward convergence. Unlike black-box
sequence models, GFM incorporates structural knowledge of gradient-based
updates into the learning objective, facilitating accurate forecasting of final
weights from partial training sequences. Empirically, GFM achieves forecasting
accuracy that is competitive with Transformer-based models and significantly
outperforms LSTM and other classical baselines. Furthermore, GFM generalizes
across neural architectures and initializations, providing a unified framework
for studying optimization dynamics and accelerating convergence prediction.

Abstract: Most successful applications of deep learning involve similar training and
test conditions. However, tasks such as biological sequence design involve
searching for sequences that improve desirable properties beyond previously
known values, which requires novel hypotheses that \emph{extrapolate} beyond
training data. In these settings, extrapolation may be achieved by using random
search methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which, given an initial
state, sample local transformations to approximate a target density that
rewards states with the desired properties. However, even with a well-designed
proposal, MCMC may struggle to explore large structured state spaces
efficiently. Rather than relying on stochastic search, it would be desirable to
have a model that greedily optimizes the properties of interest, successfully
extrapolating in as few steps as possible. We propose to learn such a model
from the Markov chains resulting from MCMC search. Specifically, our approach
uses selected states from Markov chains as a source of training data for an
autoregressive model, which is then able to efficiently generate novel
sequences that extrapolate along the sequence-level properties of interest. The
proposed approach is validated on three problems: protein sequence design, text
sentiment control, and text anonymization. We find that the autoregressive
model can extrapolate as well or better than MCMC, but with the additional
benefits of scalability and significantly higher sample efficiency.

Abstract: The fidelity with which neural networks can now generate content such as
music presents a scientific opportunity: these systems appear to have learned
implicit theories of the structure of such content through statistical learning
alone. This could offer a novel lens on theories of human-generated media.
Where these representations align with traditional constructs (e.g. chord
progressions in music), they demonstrate how these can be inferred from
statistical regularities. Where they diverge, they highlight potential limits
in our theoretical frameworks -- patterns that we may have overlooked but that
nonetheless hold significant explanatory power. In this paper, we focus on the
specific case of music generators. We introduce a method to discover musical
concepts using sparse autoencoders (SAEs), extracting interpretable features
from the residual stream activations of a transformer model. We evaluate this
approach by extracting a large set of features and producing an automatic
labeling and evaluation pipeline for them. Our results reveal both familiar
musical concepts and counterintuitive patterns that lack clear counterparts in
existing theories or natural language altogether. Beyond improving model
transparency, our work provides a new empirical tool that might help discover
organizing principles in ways that have eluded traditional methods of analysis

Conclusion: BPS为二阶预测器提供了有效的共形预测方法，同时处理了预测有效性和无效性的情况。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular frequentist framework for representing
uncertainty by providing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the true
label with a user-adjustable probability. In most applications, CP operates on
confidence scores coming from a standard (first-order) probabilistic predictor
(e.g., softmax outputs). Second-order predictors, such as credal set predictors
or Bayesian models, are also widely used for uncertainty quantification and are
known for their ability to represent both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.
Despite their popularity, there is still an open question on ``how they can be
incorporated into CP''. In this paper, we discuss the desiderata for CP when
valid second-order predictions are available. We then introduce Bernoulli
prediction sets (BPS), which produce the smallest prediction sets that ensure
conditional coverage in this setting. When given first-order predictions, BPS
reduces to the well-known adaptive prediction sets (APS). Furthermore, when the
validity assumption on the second-order predictions is compromised, we apply
conformal risk control to obtain a marginal coverage guarantee while still
accounting for epistemic uncertainty.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI offer promising solutions for synthetic data
generation but often rely on large datasets for effective training. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generative model that learns from limited
data by incorporating physical constraints to enhance performance.
Specifically, we extend the VAE architecture by incorporating physical models
in the generative process, enabling it to capture underlying dynamics more
effectively. While physical models provide valuable insights, they struggle to
capture complex temporal dependencies present in real-world data. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a discrepancy term to account for unmodeled dynamics,
represented within a latent Gaussian Process VAE (GPVAE). Furthermore, we apply
regularization to ensure the generated data aligns closely with observed data,
enhancing both the diversity and accuracy of the synthetic samples. The
proposed method is applied to indoor temperature data, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that PIGPVAE can
produce realistic samples beyond the observed distribution, highlighting its
robustness and usefulness under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Calibration is a critical requirement for reliable probabilistic prediction,
especially in high-risk applications. However, the theoretical understanding of
which learning algorithms can simultaneously achieve high accuracy and good
calibration remains limited, and many existing studies provide empirical
validation or a theoretical guarantee in restrictive settings. To address this
issue, in this work, we focus on the smooth calibration error (CE) and provide
a uniform convergence bound, showing that the smooth CE is bounded by the sum
of the smooth CE over the training dataset and a generalization gap. We further
prove that the functional gradient of the loss function can effectively control
the training smooth CE. Based on this framework, we analyze three
representative algorithms: gradient boosting trees, kernel boosting, and
two-layer neural networks. For each, we derive conditions under which both
classification and calibration performances are simultaneously guaranteed. Our
results offer new theoretical insights and practical guidance for designing
reliable probabilistic models with provable calibration guarantees.

Result: 先进模型在复杂任务（如三分之二多数通过决议）中表现不佳，但揭示了LLMs的共识策略。

Abstract: Achieving political consensus is crucial yet challenging for the effective
functioning of social governance. However, although frontier AI systems
represented by large language models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in recent
years, their capabilities on this scope are still understudied. In this paper,
we introduce EuroCon, a novel benchmark constructed from 2,225 high-quality
deliberation records of the European Parliament over 13 years, ranging from
2009 to 2022, to evaluate the ability of LLMs to reach political consensus
among divergent party positions across diverse parliament settings.
Specifically, EuroCon incorporates four factors to build each simulated
parliament setting: specific political issues, political goals, participating
parties, and power structures based on seat distribution. We also develop an
evaluation framework for EuroCon to simulate real voting outcomes in different
parliament settings, assessing whether LLM-generated resolutions meet
predefined political goals. Our experimental results demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art models remain undersatisfied with complex tasks like passing
resolutions by a two-thirds majority and addressing security issues, while
revealing some common strategies LLMs use to find consensus under different
power structures, such as prioritizing the stance of the dominant party,
highlighting EuroCon's promise as an effective platform for studying LLMs'
ability to find political consensus.

Motivation: 研究对抗攻击在无法访问目标模型训练数据或频繁查询目标模型受限的现实场景中的可行性。

Method: 利用公开的CLIP模型和数据集，通过文本概念生成对抗扰动，无需查询目标模型。

Result: 在ImageNet和CIFAR-10上分别达到85%和99%的攻击成功率，并成功攻击了Google、Baidu、GPT-4和Claude-3.5等实际系统。

Conclusion: UnivIntruder展示了在传统攻击途径受限时的实用性，呼吁重新评估AI应用的安全范式。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved widespread success yet remain prone
to adversarial attacks. Typically, such attacks either involve frequent queries
to the target model or rely on surrogate models closely mirroring the target
model -- often trained with subsets of the target model's training data -- to
achieve high attack success rates through transferability. However, in
realistic scenarios where training data is inaccessible and excessive queries
can raise alarms, crafting adversarial examples becomes more challenging. In
this paper, we present UnivIntruder, a novel attack framework that relies
solely on a single, publicly available CLIP model and publicly available
datasets. By using textual concepts, UnivIntruder generates universal,
transferable, and targeted adversarial perturbations that mislead DNNs into
misclassifying inputs into adversary-specified classes defined by textual
concepts.
  Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of up to 85% on ImageNet and over 99% on CIFAR-10, significantly
outperforming existing transfer-based methods. Additionally, we reveal
real-world vulnerabilities, showing that even without querying target models,
UnivIntruder compromises image search engines like Google and Baidu with ASR
rates up to 84%, and vision language models like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 with ASR
rates up to 80%. These findings underscore the practicality of our attack in
scenarios where traditional avenues are blocked, highlighting the need to
reevaluate security paradigms in AI applications.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models in natural language processing
has substantially elevated their semantic understanding and logical reasoning
capabilities. Such proficiencies have been leveraged in autonomous driving
systems, contributing to significant improvements in system performance. Models
such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning,
an advanced cognitive method that simulates human thinking processes,
demonstrating remarkable reasoning capabilities in complex tasks. By
structuring complex driving scenarios within a systematic reasoning framework,
this approach has emerged as a prominent research focus in autonomous driving,
substantially improving the system's ability to handle challenging cases. This
paper investigates how CoT methods improve the reasoning abilities of
autonomous driving models. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we
present a systematic analysis of the motivations, methodologies, challenges,
and future research directions of CoT in autonomous driving. Furthermore, we
propose the insight of combining CoT with self-learning to facilitate
self-evolution in driving systems. To ensure the relevance and timeliness of
this study, we have compiled a dynamic repository of literature and open-source
projects, diligently updated to incorporate forefront developments. The

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,
capable of producing high-quality samples that generalize beyond the training
data. However, evaluating this generalization remains challenging: theoretical
metrics are often impractical for high-dimensional data, while no practical
metrics rigorously measure generalization. In this work, we bridge this gap by
introducing probability flow distance ($\texttt{PFD}$), a theoretically
grounded and computationally efficient metric to measure distributional
generalization. Specifically, $\texttt{PFD}$ quantifies the distance between
distributions by comparing their noise-to-data mappings induced by the
probability flow ODE. Moreover, by using $\texttt{PFD}$ under a teacher-student
evaluation protocol, we empirically uncover several key generalization
behaviors in diffusion models, including: (1) scaling behavior from
memorization to generalization, (2) early learning and double descent training
dynamics, and (3) bias-variance decomposition. Beyond these insights, our work
lays a foundation for future empirical and theoretical studies on
generalization in diffusion models.

Abstract: In an increasing number of applications designers have access to multiple
computer models which typically have different levels of fidelity and cost.
Traditionally, designers calibrate these models one at a time against some
high-fidelity data (e.g., experiments). In this paper, we question this
tradition and assess the potential of calibrating multiple computer models at
the same time. To this end, we develop a probabilistic framework that is
founded on customized neural networks (NNs) that are designed to calibrate an
arbitrary number of computer models. In our approach, we (1) consider the fact
that most computer models are multi-response and that the number and nature of
calibration parameters may change across the models, and (2) learn a unique
probability distribution for each calibration parameter of each computer model,
(3) develop a loss function that enables our NN to emulate all data sources
while calibrating the computer models, and (4) aim to learn a visualizable
latent space where model-form errors can be identified. We test the performance
of our approach on analytic and engineering problems to understand the
potential advantages and pitfalls in simultaneous calibration of multiple
computer models. Our method can improve predictive accuracy, however, it is
prone to non-identifiability issues in higher-dimensional input spaces that are
normally constrained by underlying physics.

Result: 在三个数据集上优于单域和跨域基线方法，同时保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: FedGRec在跨域推荐中高效且隐私安全，适用于异构数据。

Abstract: Due to the highly sensitive nature of certain data in cross-border sharing,
collaborative cross-border recommendations and data sharing are often subject
to stringent privacy protection regulations, resulting in insufficient data for
model training. Consequently, achieving efficient cross-border business
recommendations while ensuring privacy security poses a significant challenge.
Although federated learning has demonstrated broad potential in collaborative
training without exposing raw data, most existing federated learning-based GNN
training methods still rely on federated averaging strategies, which perform
suboptimally on highly heterogeneous graph data. To address this issue, we
propose FedGRec, a privacy-preserving federated graph learning method for
cross-border recommendations. FedGRec captures user preferences from
distributed multi-domain data to enhance recommendation performance across all
domains without privacy leakage. Specifically, FedGRec leverages collaborative
signals from local subgraphs associated with users or items to enrich their
representation learning. Additionally, it employs dynamic spatiotemporal
modeling to integrate global and local user preferences in real time based on
business recommendation states, thereby deriving the final representations of
target users and candidate items. By automatically filtering relevant
behaviors, FedGRec effectively mitigates noise interference from unreliable
neighbors. Furthermore, through a personalized federated aggregation strategy,
FedGRec adapts global preferences to heterogeneous domain data, enabling
collaborative learning of user preferences across multiple domains. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate that FedGRec consistently outperforms
competitive single-domain and cross-domain baselines while effectively
preserving data privacy in cross-border recommendations.

Conclusion: R2D2-Net能有效解决BNN中先验选择问题，并在实验中验证了其性能。

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) treat neural network weights as random
variables, which aim to provide posterior uncertainty estimates and avoid
overfitting by performing inference on the posterior weights. However, the
selection of appropriate prior distributions remains a challenging task, and
BNNs may suffer from catastrophic inflated variance or poor predictive
performance when poor choices are made for the priors. Existing BNN designs
apply different priors to weights, while the behaviours of these priors make it
difficult to sufficiently shrink noisy signals or they are prone to
overshrinking important signals in the weights. To alleviate this problem, we
propose a novel R2D2-Net, which imposes the R^2-induced Dirichlet Decomposition
(R2D2) prior to the BNN weights. The R2D2-Net can effectively shrink irrelevant
coefficients towards zero, while preventing key features from over-shrinkage.
To approximate the posterior distribution of weights more accurately, we
further propose a variational Gibbs inference algorithm that combines the Gibbs
updating procedure and gradient-based optimization. This strategy enhances
stability and consistency in estimation when the variational objective
involving the shrinkage parameters is non-convex. We also analyze the evidence
lower bound (ELBO) and the posterior concentration rates from a theoretical
perspective. Experiments on both natural and medical image classification and
uncertainty estimation tasks demonstrate satisfactory performance of our
method.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in wind speed forecasting is a critical

Prediction Interval (PI) estimation approach and can obtain the narrow PI with
asymptotical coverage guarantees without any distribution assumption. Our deep
probabilistic forecasting models effectively incorporate popular architectures
such as LSTM, GRU, and TCN within the Tube loss framework. We further design a
simple yet effective heuristic for tuning the $\delta$ parameter of the Tube
loss function so that our deep forecasting models obtain the narrower PI
without compromising its calibration ability. We have considered three wind
datasets, containing the hourly recording of the wind speed, collected from

numerical results demonstrate that the proposed deep forecasting models produce
more reliable and narrower PIs compared to recently developed probabilistic

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become prominent methods for graph
representation learning, demonstrating strong empirical results on diverse
graph prediction tasks. In this paper, we introduce Convexified Message Passing
Graph Neural Networks (CGNNs), a novel and general framework that combines the
power of message-passing GNNs with the tractability of convex optimization. By
mapping their nonlinear filters into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, CGNNs
transform training into a convex optimization problem, which can be solved
efficiently and optimally by projected gradient methods. This convexity further
allows the statistical properties of CGNNs to be analyzed accurately and
rigorously. For two-layer CGNNs, we establish rigorous generalization
guarantees, showing convergence to the performance of the optimal GNN. To scale
to deeper architectures, we adopt a principled layer-wise training strategy.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CGNNs significantly exceed the
performance of leading GNN models, achieving 10 to 40 percent higher accuracy
in most cases, underscoring their promise as a powerful and principled method
with strong theoretical foundations. In rare cases where improvements are not
quantitatively substantial, the convex models either slightly exceed or match
the baselines, stressing their robustness and wide applicability. Though
over-parameterization is often employed to enhance performance in nonconvex
models, we show that our CGNNs framework yields shallow convex models that can
surpass these models in both accuracy and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: HDT框架克服了现有方法的局限性，同时保持了高效采样和兼容性。

Abstract: We propose a history-driven target (HDT) framework in Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) to improve any random walk algorithm on discrete state spaces,
such as general undirected graphs, for efficient sampling from target
distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. With broad applications in network science and
distributed optimization, recent innovations like the self-repellent random
walk (SRRW) achieve near-zero variance by prioritizing under-sampled states
through transition kernel modifications based on past visit frequencies.
However, SRRW's reliance on explicit computation of transition probabilities
for all neighbors at each step introduces substantial computational overhead,
while its strict dependence on time-reversible Markov chains excludes advanced
non-reversible MCMC methods. To overcome these limitations, instead of direct
modification of transition kernel, HDT introduces a history-dependent target
distribution $\boldsymbol{\pi}[\mathbf{x}]$ to replace the original target
$\boldsymbol{\mu}$ in any graph sampler, where $\mathbf{x}$ represents the
empirical measure of past visits. This design preserves lightweight
implementation by requiring only local information between the current and
proposed states and achieves compatibility with both reversible and
non-reversible MCMC samplers, while retaining unbiased samples with target
distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and near-zero variance performance. Extensive
experiments in graph sampling demonstrate consistent performance gains, and a
memory-efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache ensures scalability to large
general graphs.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting plays a critical role in many real-world
applications. Although increasingly powerful models have been developed and
achieved superior results on benchmark datasets, through a fine-grained
sample-level inspection, we find that (i) no single model consistently
outperforms others across different test samples, but instead (ii) each model
excels in specific cases. These findings prompt us to explore how to adaptively
leverage the distinct strengths of various forecasting models for different
samples. We introduce TimeFuse, a framework for collective time-series
forecasting with sample-level adaptive fusion of heterogeneous models. TimeFuse
utilizes meta-features to characterize input time series and trains a learnable
fusor to predict optimal model fusion weights for any given input. The fusor
can leverage samples from diverse datasets for joint training, allowing it to
adapt to a wide variety of temporal patterns and thus generalize to new inputs,

Abstract: Graphs are a widely used paradigm for representing non-Euclidean data, with
applications ranging from social network analysis to biomolecular prediction.
Conventional graph learning approaches typically rely on fixed structural
assumptions or fully observed data, limiting their effectiveness in more
complex, noisy, or evolving settings. Consequently, real-world graph data often
violates the assumptions of traditional graph learning methods, in particular,
it leads to four fundamental challenges: (1) Incompleteness, real-world graphs
have missing nodes, edges, or attributes; (2) Imbalance, the distribution of
the labels of nodes or edges and their structures for real-world graphs are
highly skewed; (3) Cross-domain Heterogeneity, graphs from different domains
exhibit incompatible feature spaces or structural patterns; and (4) Dynamic
Instability, graphs evolve over time in unpredictable ways. Recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to tackle these challenges by
leveraging rich semantic reasoning and external knowledge. This survey provides
a comprehensive review of how LLMs can be integrated with graph learning to
address the aforementioned challenges. For each challenge, we review both
traditional solutions and modern LLM-driven approaches, highlighting how LLMs
contribute unique advantages. Finally, we discuss open research questions and
promising future directions in this emerging interdisciplinary field. To
support further exploration, we have curated a repository of recent advances on

Conclusion: 该框架通过粒子动态平衡和随机性增强了超图消息传递的深度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hypergraphs effectively model higher-order relationships in natural
phenomena, capturing complex interactions beyond pairwise connections. We
introduce a novel hypergraph message passing framework inspired by interacting
particle systems, where hyperedges act as fields inducing shared node dynamics.
By incorporating attraction, repulsion, and Allen-Cahn forcing terms, particles
of varying classes and features achieve class-dependent equilibrium, enabling
separability through the particle-driven message passing. We investigate both
first-order and second-order particle system equations for modeling these
dynamics, which mitigate over-smoothing and heterophily thus can capture
complete interactions. The more stable second-order system permits deeper
message passing. Furthermore, we enhance deterministic message passing with
stochastic element to account for interaction uncertainties. We prove
theoretically that our approach mitigates over-smoothing by maintaining a
positive lower bound on the hypergraph Dirichlet energy during propagation and
thus to enable hypergraph message passing to go deep. Empirically, our models
demonstrate competitive performance on diverse real-world hypergraph node
classification tasks, excelling on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.

Conclusion: CLaDMoP展示了在临床试验结果预测中的潜力，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Many existing models for clinical trial outcome prediction are optimized
using task-specific loss functions on trial phase-specific data. While this
scheme may boost prediction for common diseases and drugs, it can hinder
learning of generalizable representations, leading to more false
positives/negatives. To address this limitation, we introduce CLaDMoP, a new
pre-training approach for clinical trial outcome prediction, alongside the
Successful Clinical Trials dataset(SCT), specifically designed for this task.
CLaDMoP leverages a Large Language Model-to encode trials' eligibility
criteria-linked to a lightweight Drug-Molecule branch through a novel
multi-level fusion technique. To efficiently fuse long embeddings across
levels, we incorporate a grouping block, drastically reducing computational
overhead. CLaDMoP avoids reliance on task-specific objectives by pre-training
on a "pair matching" proxy task. Compared to established zero-shot and few-shot
baselines, our method significantly improves both PR-AUC and ROC-AUC,
especially for phase I and phase II trials. We further evaluate and perform
ablation on CLaDMoP after Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, comparing it to
state-of-the-art supervised baselines, including MEXA-CTP, on the Trial Outcome
Prediction(TOP) benchmark. CLaDMoP achieves up to 10.5% improvement in PR-AUC
and 3.6% in ROC-AUC, while attaining comparable F1 score to MEXA-CTP,
highlighting its potential for clinical trial outcome prediction. Code and SCT

Conclusion: JSA自编码器为离散和连续变量的生成建模提供了高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Our examination of existing deep generative models (DGMs), including VAEs and
GANs, reveals two problems. First, their capability in handling discrete
observations and latent codes is unsatisfactory, though there are interesting
efforts. Second, both VAEs and GANs optimize some criteria that are indirectly
related to the data likelihood. To address these problems, we formally present
Joint-stochastic-approximation (JSA) autoencoders - a new family of algorithms
for building deep directed generative models, with application to
semi-supervised learning. The JSA learning algorithm directly maximizes the
data log-likelihood and simultaneously minimizes the inclusive KL divergence
the between the posteriori and the inference model. We provide theoretical
results and conduct a series of experiments to show its superiority such as
being robust to structure mismatch between encoder and decoder, consistent
handling of both discrete and continuous variables. Particularly we empirically
show that JSA autoencoders with discrete latent space achieve comparable
performance to other state-of-the-art DGMs with continuous latent space in
semi-supervised tasks over the widely adopted datasets - MNIST and SVHN. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that discrete latent
variable models are successfully applied in the challenging semi-supervised

Abstract: Stock price prediction remains a complex and high-stakes task in financial
analysis, traditionally addressed using statistical models or, more recently,
language models. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Vision-Language Inference
for Stock Time-series Analysis), a novel, training-free framework that
leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal stock forecasting.
VISTA prompts a VLM with both textual representations of historical stock
prices and their corresponding line charts to predict future price values. By
combining numerical and visual modalities in a zero-shot setting and using
carefully designed chain-of-thought prompts, VISTA captures complementary
patterns that unimodal approaches often miss. We benchmark VISTA against
standard baselines, including ARIMA and text-only LLM-based prompting methods.
Experimental results show that VISTA outperforms these baselines by up to
89.83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal inference for stock
time-series analysis and highlighting the potential of VLMs in financial
forecasting tasks without requiring task-specific training.

Abstract: We address the optimization problem of simultaneously minimizing multiple
objective functionals over a family of probability distributions. This type of
Multi-Objective Distributional Optimization commonly arises in machine learning
and statistics, with applications in areas such as multiple target sampling,
multi-task learning, and multi-objective generative modeling. To solve this
problem, we propose an iterative particle-based algorithm, which we call
Muliple Wasserstein Gradient Descent (MWGraD), which constructs a flow of
intermediate empirical distributions, each being represented by a set of
particles, which gradually minimize the multiple objective functionals
simultaneously. Specifically, MWGraD consists of two key steps at each
iteration. First, it estimates the Wasserstein gradient for each objective
functional based on the current particles. Then, it aggregates these gradients
into a single Wasserstein gradient using dynamically adjusted weights and
updates the particles accordingly. In addition, we provide theoretical analysis
and present experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of MWGraD.

Abstract: The very challenging task of learning solution operators of PDEs on arbitrary
domains accurately and efficiently is of vital importance to engineering and
industrial simulations. Despite the existence of many operator learning
algorithms to approximate such PDEs, we find that accurate models are not
necessarily computationally efficient and vice versa. We address this issue by
proposing a geometry aware operator transformer (GAOT) for learning PDEs on
arbitrary domains. GAOT combines novel multiscale attentional graph neural
operator encoders and decoders, together with geometry embeddings and (vision)
transformer processors to accurately map information about the domain and the
inputs into a robust approximation of the PDE solution. Multiple innovations in
the implementation of GAOT also ensure computational efficiency and
scalability. We demonstrate this significant gain in both accuracy and
efficiency of GAOT over several baselines on a large number of learning tasks
from a diverse set of PDEs, including achieving state of the art performance on
a large scale three-dimensional industrial CFD dataset.

Result: 实例级隐私损失与现有数据难度指标相关，同时能识别更困难的数据点，并提出了基于损失屏障的新评估方法。

Conclusion: 为针对单个数据点的更高效、自适应遗忘策略提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We present a principled, per-instance approach to quantifying the difficulty
of unlearning via fine-tuning. We begin by sharpening an analysis of noisy
gradient descent for unlearning (Chien et al., 2024), obtaining a better
utility-unlearning tradeoff by replacing worst-case privacy loss bounds with
per-instance privacy losses (Thudi et al., 2024), each of which bounds the
(Renyi) divergence to retraining without an individual data point. To
demonstrate the practical applicability of our theory, we present empirical
results showing that our theoretical predictions are born out both for
Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) as well as for standard
fine-tuning without explicit noise. We further demonstrate that per-instance
privacy losses correlate well with several existing data difficulty metrics,
while also identifying harder groups of data points, and introduce novel
evaluation methods based on loss barriers. All together, our findings provide a
foundation for more efficient and adaptive unlearning strategies tailored to
the unique properties of individual data points.

Abstract: Building on the framework proposed in Boffi et al. (2024), we present a
systematic approach for learning flow maps associated with flow and diffusion
models. Flow map-based models, commonly known as consistency models, encompass
recent efforts to improve the efficiency of generative models based on
solutions to differential equations. By exploiting a relationship between the
velocity field underlying a continuous-time flow and the instantaneous rate of
change of the flow map, we show how to convert existing distillation schemes
into direct training algorithms via self-distillation, eliminating the need for
pre-trained models. We empirically evaluate several instantiations of our
framework, finding that high-dimensional tasks like image synthesis benefit
from objective functions that avoid temporal and spatial derivatives of the
flow map, while lower-dimensional tasks can benefit from objectives
incorporating higher-order derivatives to capture sharp features.

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) has attracted significant attention
due to its scalability and independence from a central server. In practice,
some participating clients can be mobile, yet the impact of user mobility on
DFL performance remains largely unexplored, despite its potential to facilitate

introducing a small fraction of mobile clients, even with random movement, can
significantly improve the accuracy of DFL by facilitating information flow. To
further enhance performance, we propose novel distribution-aware mobility
patterns, where mobile clients strategically navigate the network, leveraging
knowledge of data distributions and static client locations. The proposed
moving strategies mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity and boost learning
convergence. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of induced
mobility in DFL and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed mobility

Conclusion: GOLA框架在复杂域问题上具有更强的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Operator learning seeks to approximate mappings from input functions to
output solutions, particularly in the context of partial differential equations
(PDEs). While recent advances such as DeepONet and Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO) have demonstrated strong performance, they often rely on regular grid
discretizations, limiting their applicability to complex or irregular domains.
In this work, we propose a Graph-based Operator Learning with Attention (GOLA)
framework that addresses this limitation by constructing graphs from
irregularly sampled spatial points and leveraging attention-enhanced Graph
Neural Netwoks (GNNs) to model spatial dependencies with global information. To
improve the expressive capacity, we introduce a Fourier-based encoder that
projects input functions into a frequency space using learnable complex
coefficients, allowing for flexible embeddings even with sparse or nonuniform
samples. We evaluated our approach across a range of 2D PDEs, including Darcy
Flow, Advection, Eikonal, and Nonlinear Diffusion, under varying sampling

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) in heterogeneous networks presents unique
challenges due to node and edge heterogeneity. Existing Graph Neural Network
(GNN) methods primarily focus on homogeneous GAD and thus fail to address three
key issues: (C1) Capturing abnormal signal and rich semantics across diverse
meta-paths; (C2) Retaining high-frequency content in HIN dimension alignment;
and (C3) Learning effectively from difficult anomaly samples with class
imbalance. To overcome these, we propose ChiGAD, a spectral GNN framework based
on a novel Chi-Square filter, inspired by the wavelet effectiveness in diverse
domains. Specifically, ChiGAD consists of: (1) Multi-Graph Chi-Square Filter,
which captures anomalous information via applying dedicated Chi-Square filters
to each meta-path graph; (2) Interactive Meta-Graph Convolution, which aligns
features while preserving high-frequency information and incorporates
heterogeneous messages by a unified Chi-Square Filter; and (3)
Contribution-Informed Cross-Entropy Loss, which prioritizes difficult anomalies
to address class imbalance. Extensive experiments on public and industrial
datasets show that ChiGAD outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple
metrics. Additionally, its homogeneous variant, ChiGNN, excels on seven GAD
datasets, validating the effectiveness of Chi-Square filters. Our code is

Abstract: With the advancement of edge computing, federated learning (FL) displays a
bright promise as a privacy-preserving collaborative learning paradigm.
However, one major challenge for FL is the data heterogeneity issue, which
refers to the biased labeling preferences among multiple clients, negatively
impacting convergence and model performance. Most previous FL methods attempt
to tackle the data heterogeneity issue locally or globally, neglecting
underlying class-wise structure information contained in each client. In this
paper, we first study how data heterogeneity affects the divergence of the
model and decompose it into local, global, and sampling drift sub-problems. To
explore the potential of using intra-client class-wise structural knowledge in
handling these drifts, we thus propose Federated Learning with Structural
Knowledge Collaboration (FedSKC). The key idea of FedSKC is to extract and
transfer domain preferences from inter-client data distributions, offering
diverse class-relevant knowledge and a fair convergent signal. FedSKC comprises
three components: i) local contrastive learning, to prevent weight divergence
resulting from local training; ii) global discrepancy aggregation, which
addresses the parameter deviation between the server and clients; iii) global
period review, correcting for the sampling drift introduced by the server
randomly selecting devices. We have theoretically analyzed FedSKC under
non-convex objectives and empirically validated its superiority through
extensive experimental results.

Abstract: While diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation with
their ability to synthesize realistic and diverse scenes, they continue to
struggle to generate consistent and legible text within images. This
shortcoming is commonly attributed to the locality bias inherent in
diffusion-based generation, which limits their ability to model long-range
spatial dependencies. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{STRICT}$, a
benchmark designed to systematically stress-test the ability of diffusion
models to render coherent and instruction-aligned text in images. Our benchmark
evaluates models across multiple dimensions: (1) the maximum length of readable
text that can be generated; (2) the correctness and legibility of the generated
text, and (3) the ratio of not following instructions for generating text. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models, including proprietary and open-source
variants, and reveal persistent limitations in long-range consistency and
instruction-following capabilities. Our findings provide insights into
architectural bottlenecks and motivate future research directions in multimodal
generative modeling. We release our entire evaluation pipeline at

Abstract: Data Shapley is an important tool for data valuation, which quantifies the
contribution of individual data points to machine learning models. In practice,
group-level data valuation is desirable when data providers contribute data in
batch. However, we identify that existing group-level extensions of Data
Shapley are vulnerable to shell company attacks, where strategic group
splitting can unfairly inflate valuations. We propose Faithful Group Shapley
Value (FGSV) that uniquely defends against such attacks. Building on original
mathematical insights, we develop a provably fast and accurate approximation
algorithm for computing FGSV. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our
algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational
efficiency and approximation accuracy, while ensuring faithful group-level

Motivation: 过参数化模型可能记忆训练数据，但其隐私影响尚不明确，尤其是在仅能访问模型输出的场景下。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，研究了核方法模型（如核回归、支持向量机等）在查询输出时泄露训练数据的可能性。

Result: 研究发现，仅通过查询模型输出即可重构训练数据，无需访问模型参数。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了核方法模型的潜在隐私风险。

Abstract: Over-parameterized models have raised concerns about their potential to
memorize training data, even when achieving strong generalization. The privacy
implications of such memorization are generally unclear, particularly in
scenarios where only model outputs are accessible. We study this question in
the context of kernel methods, and demonstrate both empirically and
theoretically that querying kernel models at various points suffices to
reconstruct their training data, even without access to model parameters. Our
results hold for a range of kernel methods, including kernel regression,
support vector machines, and kernel density estimation. Our hope is that this
work can illuminate potential privacy concerns for such models.

Conclusion: PiNGDA通过科学分析噪声的积极作用，提供了一种更可靠的图数据增强方法，为图对比学习领域带来新思路。

Abstract: Although graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been widely investigated, it is
still a challenge to generate effective and stable graph augmentations.
Existing methods often apply heuristic augmentation like random edge dropping,
which may disrupt important graph structures and result in unstable GCL
performance. In this paper, we propose Positive-incentive Noise driven Graph
Data Augmentation (PiNGDA), where positive-incentive noise (pi-noise)
scientifically analyzes the beneficial effect of noise under the information
theory. To bridge the standard GCL and pi-noise framework, we design a Gaussian
auxiliary variable to convert the loss function to information entropy. We
prove that the standard GCL with pre-defined augmentations is equivalent to
estimate the beneficial noise via the point estimation. Following our analysis,
PiNGDA is derived from learning the beneficial noise on both topology and
attributes through a trainable noise generator for graph augmentations, instead
of the simple estimation. Since the generator learns how to produce beneficial
perturbations on graph topology and node attributes, PiNGDA is more reliable
compared with the existing methods. Extensive experimental results validate the
effectiveness and stability of PiNGDA.

Conclusion: 离线聚类方法可有效利用离线数据提升决策性能。

Abstract: Contextual linear multi-armed bandits are a learning framework for making a
sequence of decisions, e.g., advertising recommendations for a sequence of
arriving users. Recent works have shown that clustering these users based on
the similarity of their learned preferences can significantly accelerate the
learning. However, prior work has primarily focused on the online setting,
which requires continually collecting user data, ignoring the offline data
widely available in many applications. To tackle these limitations, we study
the offline clustering of bandits (Off-ClusBand) problem, which studies how to
use the offline dataset to learn cluster properties and improve decision-making
across multiple users. The key challenge in Off-ClusBand arises from data
insufficiency for users: unlike the online case, in the offline case, we have a
fixed, limited dataset to work from and thus must determine whether we have
enough data to confidently cluster users together. To address this challenge,
we propose two algorithms: Off-C$^2$LUB, which we analytically show performs
well for arbitrary amounts of user data, and Off-CLUB, which is prone to bias
when data is limited but, given sufficient data, matches a theoretical lower
bound that we derive for the offline clustered MAB problem. We experimentally
validate these results on both real and synthetic datasets.

Result: 泛化差距被界限为√((β𝔼L(θ₀) + log(1/δ))/N)，不依赖训练时间或模型维度。

Conclusion: 证明了马尔可夫过程训练的泛化性能可以通过Gibbs稳态分布分析，且证明过程简洁。

Abstract: We analyze the generalization gap (gap between the training and test errors)
when training a potentially over-parametrized model using a Markovian
stochastic training algorithm, initialized from some distribution $\theta_0
\sim p_0$. We focus on Langevin dynamics with a positive temperature
$\beta^{-1}$, i.e. gradient descent on a training loss $L$ with infinitesimal
step size, perturbed with $\beta^{-1}$-variances Gaussian noise, and lightly
regularized or bounded. There, we bound the generalization gap, at any time
during training, by $\sqrt{(\beta\mathbb{E} L (\theta_0) + \log(1/\delta))/N}$
with probability $1-\delta$ over the dataset, where $N$ is the sample size, and
$\mathbb{E} L (\theta_0) =O(1)$ with standard initialization scaling. In
contrast to previous guarantees, we have no dependence on either training time
or reliance on mixing, nor a dependence on dimensionality, gradient norms, or
any other properties of the loss or model. This guarantee follows from a
general analysis of any Markov process-based training that has a Gibbs-style
stationary distribution. The proof is surprisingly simple, once we observe that
the marginal distribution divergence from initialization remains bounded, as
implied by a generalized second law of thermodynamics.

Conclusion: 本书为设计可扩展、隐私保护的FL系统提供了理论与实践指导。

Abstract: This book offers a hands-on introduction to building and understanding
federated learning (FL) systems. FL enables multiple devices -- such as
smartphones, sensors, or local computers -- to collaboratively train machine
learning (ML) models, while keeping their data private and local. It is a
powerful solution when data cannot or should not be centralized due to privacy,
regulatory, or technical reasons. The book is designed for students, engineers,
and researchers who want to learn how to design scalable, privacy preserving FL
systems. Our main focus is on personalization: enabling each device to train
its own model while still benefiting from collaboration with relevant devices.
This is achieved by leveraging similarities between (the learning tasks
associated with) devices that are encoded by the weighted edges (or links) of a
federated learning network (FL network). The key idea is to represent
real-world FL systems as networks of devices, where nodes correspond to device
and edges represent communication links and data similarities between them. The
training of personalized models for these devices can be naturally framed as a
distributed optimization problem. This optimization problem is referred to as
generalized total variation minimization (GTVMin) and ensures that devices with
similar learning tasks learn similar model parameters. Our approach is both
mathematically principled and practically motivated. While we introduce some
advanced ideas from optimization theory and graph-based learning, we aim to
keep the book accessible. Readers are guided through the core ideas step by
step, with intuitive explanations.

Abstract: Researchers have proposed various methods of incorporating more structured
information into the design of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance their
expressiveness. However, these methods are either computationally expensive or
lacking in provable expressiveness. In this paper, we observe that the chords
increase the complexity of the graph structure while contributing little useful
information in many cases. In contrast, chordless structures are more efficient
and effective for representing the graph. Therefore, when leveraging the
information of cycles, we choose to omit the chords. Accordingly, we propose a
Chordless Structure-based Graph Neural Network (CSGNN) and prove that its
expressiveness is strictly more powerful than the k-hop GNN (KPGNN) with
polynomial complexity. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate
that CSGNN outperforms existing GNNs across various graph tasks while incurring
lower computational costs and achieving better performance than the GNNs of
3-WL expressiveness.

Conclusion: GMAN不仅性能优越，还通过节点级、图级和子集级重要性提供可解释性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Real-world medical data often includes measurements from multiple signals
that are collected at irregular and asynchronous time intervals. For example,
different types of blood tests can be measured at different times and
frequencies, resulting in fragmented and unevenly scattered temporal data.
Similar issues of irregular sampling of different attributes occur in other
domains, such as monitoring of large systems using event log files or the
spread of fake news on social networks. Effectively learning from such data
requires models that can handle sets of temporally sparse and heterogeneous
signals. In this paper, we propose Graph Mixing Additive Networks (GMAN), a
novel and interpretable-by-design model for learning over irregular sets of
temporal signals. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in
real-world medical tasks, including a 4-point increase in the AUROC score of
in-hospital mortality prediction, compared to existing methods. We further
showcase GMAN's flexibility by applying it to a fake news detection task. We
demonstrate how its interpretability capabilities, including node-level,
graph-level, and subset-level importance, allow for transition phases detection
and gaining medical insights with real-world high-stakes implications. Finally,
we provide theoretical insights on GMAN expressive power.

Abstract: Agricultural decision-making involves complex, context-specific reasoning,
where choices about crops, practices, and interventions depend heavily on
geographic, climatic, and economic conditions. Traditional large language
models (LLMs) often fall short in navigating this nuanced problem due to
limited reasoning capacity. We hypothesize that recent advances in large

inference. To investigate this, we introduce AgReason, the first expert-curated
open-ended science benchmark with 100 questions for agricultural reasoning.
Evaluations across thirteen open-source and proprietary models reveal that LRMs
outperform conventional ones, though notable challenges persist, with the
strongest Gemini-based baseline achieving 36% accuracy. We also present
AgThoughts, a large-scale dataset of 44.6K question-answer pairs generated with
human oversight and equipped with synthetically generated reasoning traces.
Using AgThoughts, we develop AgThinker, a suite of small reasoning models that
can be run on consumer-grade GPUs, and show that our dataset can be effective

Conclusion: TypiClust是低预算FAL的有效策略，适用于数据有限和异构的场景。

Abstract: Federated Active Learning (FAL) seeks to reduce the burden of annotation
under the realistic constraints of federated learning by leveraging Active
Learning (AL). As FAL settings make it more expensive to obtain ground truth
labels, FAL strategies that work well in low-budget regimes, where the amount
of annotation is very limited, are needed. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of TypiClust, a successful low-budget AL strategy, in low-budget
FAL settings. Our empirical results show that TypiClust works well even in
low-budget FAL settings contrasted with relatively low performances of other
methods, although these settings present additional challenges, such as data
heterogeneity, compared to AL. In addition, we show that FAL settings cause
distribution shifts in terms of typicality, but TypiClust is not very
vulnerable to the shifts. We also analyze the sensitivity of TypiClust to
feature extraction methods, and it suggests a way to perform FAL even in
limited data situations.

generating explanations based on spurious correlations, potentially undermining

approach. We demonstrate that MetaGMT significantly improves both explanation
quality (AUC-ROC, Precision@K) and robustness to spurious patterns, across
BA-2Motifs, MUTAG, and SP-Motif benchmarks. Our approach maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing more faithful explanations (with an
increase up to 8% of Explanation ROC on SP-Motif 0.5) compared to baseline
methods. These advancements in interpretability could enable safer deployment
of GNNs in sensitive domains by (1) facilitating model debugging through more
reliable explanations, (2) supporting targeted retraining when biases are

critical challenge of explanation reliability, our work contributes to building

Abstract: Dataset distillation enables the training of deep neural networks with
comparable performance in significantly reduced time by compressing large
datasets into small and representative ones. Although the introduction of
generative models has made great achievements in this field, the distributions
of their distilled datasets are not diverse enough to represent the original
ones, leading to a decrease in downstream validation accuracy. In this paper,
we present a diversity-driven generative dataset distillation method based on a
diffusion model to solve this problem. We introduce self-adaptive memory to
align the distribution between distilled and real datasets, assessing the
representativeness. The degree of alignment leads the diffusion model to
generate more diverse datasets during the distillation process. Extensive
experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in most situations, proving its ability to tackle dataset distillation tasks.

gradient descent with an appropriate step size achieves an
$O(1/\sqrt{1-\lambda})$ discounted regret. However, the value of $\lambda$ is
often not predetermined in real-world scenarios. This gives rise to a
significant open question: is it possible to develop a discounted algorithm
that adapts to an unknown discount factor. In this paper, we affirmatively
answer this question by providing a novel analysis to demonstrate that smoothed
OGD (SOGD) achieves a uniform $O(\sqrt{\log T/1-\lambda})$ discounted regret,
holding for all values of $\lambda$ across a continuous interval
simultaneously. The basic idea is to maintain multiple OGD instances to handle
different discount factors, and aggregate their outputs sequentially by an
online prediction algorithm named as Discounted-Normal-Predictor (DNP)
(Kapralov and Panigrahy,2010). Our analysis reveals that DNP can combine the
decisions of two experts, even when they operate on discounted regret with
different discount factors.

Motivation: 多模态学习中缺失模态是常见问题，现有稀疏专家混合架构（SMoE）对此处理不足，导致性能下降和泛化能力差。

Method: 提出Conf-SMoE，包含两阶段插补模块和基于任务置信度的专家门控机制，无需额外平衡损失函数。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上验证了Conf-SMoE在多模态融合和缺失模态抵抗方面的有效性。

Conclusion: Conf-SMoE通过理论分析和实验验证，显著提升了处理缺失模态的能力，并揭示了专家崩溃的机制。

Abstract: Effectively managing missing modalities is a fundamental challenge in
real-world multimodal learning scenarios, where data incompleteness often
results from systematic collection errors or sensor failures. Sparse
Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have the potential to naturally handle
multimodal data, with individual experts specializing in different modalities.
However, existing SMoE approach often lacks proper ability to handle missing
modality, leading to performance degradation and poor generalization in
real-world applications. We propose Conf-SMoE to introduce a two-stage
imputation module to handle the missing modality problem for the SMoE
architecture and reveal the insight of expert collapse from theoretical
analysis with strong empirical evidence. Inspired by our theoretical analysis,
Conf-SMoE propose a novel expert gating mechanism by detaching the softmax
routing score to task confidence score w.r.t ground truth. This naturally
relieves expert collapse without introducing additional load balance loss
function. We show that the insights of expert collapse aligns with other gating
mechanism such as Gaussian and Laplacian gate. We also evaluate the proposed
method on four different real world dataset with three different experiment
settings to conduct comprehensive the analysis of Conf-SMoE on modality fusion
and resistance to missing modality.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a core component of Intelligent Tutoring Systems,
modeling learners' knowledge state to predict future performance and provide
personalized learning support. Traditional KT models assume that learners'
learning abilities remain relatively stable over short periods or change in
predictable ways based on prior performance. However, in reality, learners'
abilities change irregularly due to factors like cognitive fatigue, motivation,
and external stress -- a task introduced, which we refer to as Real-time
Learning Pattern Adjustment (RLPA). Existing KT models, when faced with RLPA,
lack sufficient adaptability, because they fail to timely account for the
dynamic nature of different learners' evolving learning patterns. Current
strategies for enhancing adaptability rely on retraining, which leads to
significant overfitting and high time overhead issues. To address this, we
propose Cuff-KT, comprising a controller and a generator. The controller
assigns value scores to learners, while the generator generates personalized
parameters for selected learners. Cuff-KT controllably adapts to data changes
fast and flexibly without fine-tuning. Experiments on five datasets from
different subjects demonstrate that Cuff-KT significantly improves the
performance of five KT models with different structures under intra- and
inter-learner shifts, with an average relative increase in AUC of 10% and 4%,
respectively, at a negligible time cost, effectively tackling RLPA task. Our

Abstract: We address the challenge of training diffusion models to sample from
unnormalized energy distributions in the absence of data, the so-called
diffusion samplers. Although these approaches have shown promise, they struggle
to scale in more demanding scenarios where energy evaluations are expensive and
the sampling space is high-dimensional. To address this limitation, we propose
a scalable and sample-efficient framework that properly harmonizes the powerful
classical sampling method and the diffusion sampler. Specifically, we utilize
Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) samplers with a novelty-based auxiliary energy
as a Searcher to collect off-policy samples, using an auxiliary energy function
to compensate for exploring modes the diffusion sampler rarely visits. These
off-policy samples are then combined with on-policy data to train the diffusion
sampler, thereby expanding its coverage of the energy landscape. Furthermore,
we identify primacy bias, i.e., the preference of samplers for early experience
during training, as the main cause of mode collapse during training, and
introduce a periodic re-initialization trick to resolve this issue. Our method
significantly improves sample efficiency on standard benchmarks for diffusion
samplers and also excels at higher-dimensional problems and real-world
molecular conformer generation.

Abstract: Sketches, probabilistic structures for estimating item frequencies in
infinite data streams with limited space, are widely used across various
domains. Recent studies have shifted the focus from handcrafted sketches to
neural sketches, leveraging memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) to enhance
the streaming compression capabilities and achieve better space-accuracy
trade-offs.However, existing neural sketches struggle to scale across different
data domains and space budgets due to inflexible MANN configurations. In this
paper, we introduce a scalable MANN architecture that brings to life the {\it
Lego sketch}, a novel sketch with superior scalability and accuracy. Much like
assembling creations with modular Lego bricks, the Lego sketch dynamically
coordinates multiple memory bricks to adapt to various space budgets and
diverse data domains. Our theoretical analysis guarantees its high scalability
and provides the first error bound for neural sketch. Furthermore, extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the Lego sketch exhibits superior
space-accuracy trade-offs, outperforming existing handcrafted and neural
sketches. Our code is available at https://github.com/FFY0/LegoSketch_ICML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形预测在分布偏移下表现不佳，导致覆盖率不可靠和预测集膨胀，需要改进方法以适应非交换性数据。

Method: 1. RLSCP：利用VAE的重构损失作为不确定性度量；2. WQLCP：引入加权交换性概念，调整校准分位数阈值。

Result: WQLCP在ImageNet等数据集上优于基线方法，保持覆盖率的同时减小预测集大小。

Conclusion: WQLCP为分布偏移下的共形预测提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides a framework for constructing prediction
sets with guaranteed coverage, assuming exchangeable data. However, real-world
scenarios often involve distribution shifts that violate exchangeability,
leading to unreliable coverage and inflated prediction sets. To address this
challenge, we first introduce Reconstruction Loss-Scaled Conformal Prediction
(RLSCP), which utilizes reconstruction losses derived from a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) as an uncertainty metric to scale score functions. While
RLSCP demonstrates performance improvements, mainly resulting in better
coverage, it quantifies quantiles based on a fixed calibration dataset without
considering the discrepancies between test and train datasets in an
unexchangeable setting. In the next step, we propose Weighted Quantile
Loss-scaled Conformal Prediction (WQLCP), which refines RLSCP by incorporating
a weighted notion of exchangeability, adjusting the calibration quantile
threshold based on weights with respect to the ratio of calibration and test
loss values. This approach improves the CP-generated prediction set outputs in
the presence of distribution shifts. Experiments on large-scale datasets,
including ImageNet variants, demonstrate that WQLCP outperforms existing
baselines by consistently maintaining coverage while reducing prediction set
sizes, providing a robust solution for CP under distribution shifts.

Motivation: 在医学、经济学和社会科学等领域，从观测数据中估计因果效应至关重要，但隐私问题突出。现有方法通常直接对干扰组件进行隐私化，导致隐私成本随模型复杂度增加。

Method: 采用折叠分割和集成技术，将干扰估计与隐私保护分离，仅扰动预测和聚合步骤。框架适用于G-formula、IPW和AIPW三种经典估计器。

Result: 在现实隐私预算下保持竞争力，并支持多私有ATE估计的元分析。

Conclusion: 填补了因果推断与隐私保护数据分析之间的关键空白。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is essential in fields such
as medicine, economics and social sciences, where privacy concerns are
paramount. We propose a general, model-agnostic framework for differentially
private estimation of average treatment effects (ATE) that avoids strong
structural assumptions on the data-generating process or the models used to
estimate propensity scores and conditional outcomes. In contrast to prior work,
which enforces differential privacy by directly privatizing these nuisance
components and results in a privacy cost that scales with model complexity, our
approach decouples nuisance estimation from privacy protection. This separation
allows the use of flexible, state-of-the-art black-box models, while
differential privacy is achieved by perturbing only predictions and aggregation
steps within a fold-splitting scheme with ensemble techniques. We instantiate
the framework for three classical estimators -- the G-formula, inverse
propensity weighting (IPW), and augmented IPW (AIPW) -- and provide formal
utility and privacy guarantees. Empirical results show that our methods
maintain competitive performance under realistic privacy budgets. We further
extend our framework to support meta-analysis of multiple private ATE
estimates. Our results bridge a critical gap between causal inference and
privacy-preserving data analysis.

Conclusion: 协调和同步策略在非独立同分布数据下管理梯度多样性和加速联邦优化具有潜力。

Abstract: Federated learning on heterogeneous (non-IID) client data experiences slow
convergence due to client drift. To address this challenge, we propose
Kuramoto-FedAvg, a federated optimization algorithm that reframes the weight
aggregation step as a synchronization problem inspired by the Kuramoto model of
coupled oscillators. The server dynamically weighs each client's update based
on its phase alignment with the global update, amplifying contributions that
align with the global gradient direction while minimizing the impact of updates
that are out of phase. We theoretically prove that this synchronization
mechanism reduces client drift, providing a tighter convergence bound compared
to the standard FedAvg under heterogeneous data distributions. Empirical
validation supports our theoretical findings, showing that Kuramoto-FedAvg
significantly accelerates convergence and improves accuracy across multiple
benchmark datasets. Our work highlights the potential of coordination and
synchronization-based strategies for managing gradient diversity and
accelerating federated optimization in realistic non-IID settings.

Result: 实验验证EPOTTA在性能和计算效率上表现优异，且校准良好。

Conclusion: EPOTTA为测试时适应提供了一种高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enhances model robustness by enabling adaptation
to target distributions that differ from training distributions, improving
real-world generalizability. Existing TTA approaches focus on adjusting the
conditional distribution; however these methods often depend on uncertain
predictions in the absence of label information, leading to unreliable
performance. Energy-based frameworks suggest a promising alternative to address
distribution shifts without relying on uncertain predictions, instead computing
the marginal distribution of target data. However, they involve the critical
challenge of requiring extensive SGLD sampling, which is impractical for
test-time scenarios requiring immediate adaptation. In this work, we propose
Energy-based Preference Optimization for Test-time Adaptation (EPOTTA), which
is based on a sampling free strategy. We first parameterize the target model
using a pretrained model and residual energy function, enabling marginal
likelihood maximization of target data without sampling. Building on the
observation that the parameterization is mathematically equivalent to DPO
objective, we then directly adapt the model to a target distribution without
explicitly training the residual. Our experiments verify that EPOTTA is
well-calibrated and performant while achieving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has seen remarkable progress, particularly with the
emergence of large-scale pre-training across various modalities. However, most
current approaches are built on the assumption of a deterministic, one-to-one
alignment between modalities. This oversimplifies real-world multimodal
relationships, where their nature is inherently many-to-many. This phenomenon,
named multiplicity, is not a side-effect of noise or annotation error, but an
inevitable outcome of semantic abstraction, representational asymmetry, and
task-dependent ambiguity in multimodal tasks. This position paper argues that
multiplicity is a fundamental bottleneck that manifests across all stages of
the multimodal learning pipeline: from data construction to training and
evaluation. This paper examines the causes and consequences of multiplicity,
and highlights how multiplicity introduces training uncertainty, unreliable
evaluation, and low dataset quality. This position calls for new research
directions on multimodal learning: novel multiplicity-aware learning frameworks
and dataset construction protocols considering multiplicity.

Abstract: Deep generative models have recently garnered significant attention across
various fields, from physics to chemistry, where sampling from unnormalized
Boltzmann-like distributions represents a fundamental challenge. In particular,
autoregressive models and normalizing flows have become prominent due to their
appealing ability to yield closed-form probability densities. Moreover, it is
well-established that incorporating prior knowledge - such as symmetries - into
deep neural networks can substantially improve training performances. In this
context, recent advances have focused on developing symmetry-equivariant
generative models, achieving remarkable results. Building upon these
foundations, this paper introduces Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation
(SESaMo). Similar to equivariant normalizing flows, SESaMo enables the
incorporation of inductive biases (e.g., symmetries) into normalizing flows
through a novel technique called stochastic modulation. This approach enhances
the flexibility of the generative model, allowing to effectively learn a
variety of exact and broken symmetries. Our numerical experiments benchmark
SESaMo in different scenarios, including an 8-Gaussian mixture model and
physically relevant field theories, such as the $\phi^4$ theory and the Hubbard

Abstract: Spatio-temporal prediction is a pivotal task with broad applications in
traffic management, climate monitoring, energy scheduling, etc. However,
existing methodologies often struggle to balance model expressiveness and
computational efficiency, especially when scaling to large real-world datasets.
To tackle these challenges, we propose STH-SepNet (Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph
Separation Networks), a novel framework that decouples temporal and spatial
modeling to enhance both efficiency and precision. Therein, the temporal
dimension is modeled using lightweight large language models, which effectively
capture low-rank temporal dynamics. Concurrently, the spatial dimension is
addressed through an adaptive hypergraph neural network, which dynamically
constructs hyperedges to model intricate, higher-order interactions. A
carefully designed gating mechanism is integrated to seamlessly fuse temporal
and spatial representations. By leveraging the fundamental principles of
low-rank temporal dynamics and spatial interactions, STH-SepNet offers a
pragmatic and scalable solution for spatio-temporal prediction in real-world
applications. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of STH-SepNet in boosting
predictive performance while maintaining computational efficiency. This work

Abstract: Zero-shot streaming text-to-speech is an important research topic in

frame-by-frame. SMLLE employs a Transducer to convert text into semantic tokens
in real time while simultaneously obtaining duration alignment information. The
combined outputs are then fed into a fully autoregressive (AR) streaming model
to reconstruct mel-spectrograms. To further stabilize the generation process,
we design a Delete < Bos > Mechanism that allows the AR model to access future
text introducing as minimal delay as possible. Experimental results suggest
that the SMLLE outperforms current streaming TTS methods and achieves
comparable performance over sentence-level TTS systems. Samples are available

Abstract: Multi-Label Online Continual Learning (MOCL) requires models to learn

including persistent catastrophic forgetting, potential missing labels, and
uncontrollable imbalanced class distributions. While existing MOCL methods
attempt to address these challenges through various techniques, \textit{they

fundamental solution rooted in multi-label learning but challenging to achieve

and verify the innate localization capability of different pre-trained models.
Then, we propose CUTER (CUT-out-and-Experience-Replay), a simple yet versatile
strategy that provides fine-grained supervision signals by further identifying,
strengthening and cutting out label-specific regions for efficient experience
replay. It not only enables models to simultaneously address catastrophic
forgetting, missing labels, and class imbalance challenges, but also serves as

through strict separation from real data. Subsequently, Mosaic forms a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) from client models based on their specialized
knowledge, and distills it into a global model using the generated data. To
further enhance the MoE architecture, Mosaic integrates expert predictions via
a lightweight meta model trained on a few representative prototypes. Extensive
experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that Mosaic
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under both model and data
heterogeneity. The source code has been published at

Abstract: This paper investigates the connections between rectified flows, flow
matching, and optimal transport. Flow matching is a recent approach to learning
generative models by estimating velocity fields that guide transformations from
a source to a target distribution. Rectified flow matching aims to straighten
the learned transport paths, yielding more direct flows between distributions.
Our first contribution is a set of invariance properties of rectified flows and
explicit velocity fields. In addition, we also provide explicit constructions
and analysis in the Gaussian (not necessarily independent) and Gaussian mixture
settings and study the relation to optimal transport. Our second contribution
addresses recent claims suggesting that rectified flows, when constrained such
that the learned velocity field is a gradient, can yield (asymptotically)
solutions to optimal transport problems. We study the existence of solutions
for this problem and demonstrate that they only relate to optimal transport
under assumptions that are significantly stronger than those previously
acknowledged. In particular, we present several counter-examples that
invalidate earlier equivalence results in the literature, and we argue that
enforcing a gradient constraint on rectified flows is, in general, not a
reliable method for computing optimal transport maps.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion has recently emerged as a promising paradigm in discrete
data modeling. However, existing methods typically rely on a fixed rate
transition matrix during training, which not only limits the expressiveness of
latent representations, a fundamental strength of variational methods, but also
constrains the overall design space. To address these limitations, we propose
Discrete Markov Bridge, a novel framework specifically designed for discrete
representation learning. Our approach is built upon two key components: Matrix
Learning and Score Learning. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis,
establishing formal performance guarantees for Matrix Learning and proving the
convergence of the overall framework. Furthermore, we analyze the space
complexity of our method, addressing practical constraints identified in prior
studies. Extensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of the
proposed Discrete Markov Bridge, which achieves an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)
of 1.38 on the Text8 dataset, outperforming established baselines. Moreover,
the proposed model demonstrates competitive performance on the CIFAR-10
dataset, achieving results comparable to those obtained by image-specific
generation approaches.

Abstract: We present a novel theoretical interpretation of AlphaFold1. The seminal
breakthrough of AlphaFold1 in protein structure prediction by deep learning
relied on a learned potential energy function, in contrast to the later
end-to-end architectures of AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3. While this potential was
originally justified by referring to physical potentials of mean force (PMFs),
we reinterpret AlphaFold1's potential as an instance of probability kinematics
- also known as Jeffrey conditioning - a principled but underrecognised
generalization of conventional Bayesian updating. Probability kinematics
accommodates uncertain or soft evidence in the form of updated probabilities
over a partition. This perspective reveals AlphaFold1's potential as a form of
generalized Bayesian updating, rather than a thermodynamic potential. To
confirm our probabilistic framework's scope and precision, we analyze a
synthetic 2D model in which an angular random walk prior is updated with
evidence on distances via probability kinematics, mirroring AlphaFold1's
approach. This theoretical contribution connects AlphaFold1 to a broader class
of well-justified Bayesian methods, allowing precise quantification, surpassing
merely qualitative heuristics based on PMFs. More broadly, given the
achievements of AlphaFold1, probability kinematics holds considerable promise
for probabilistic deep learning, as it allows for the formulation of complex
models from a few simpler components.

Motivation: 临床数据通常稀疏、不规则且嘈杂，现有决策支持系统依赖离散化和插值，可能扭曲时间动态并降低决策质量。强化学习适合动态环境中的长期优化，但现有系统多为模型无关且样本效率低。

Conclusion: MedDreamer首次将潜在想象应用于不规则医疗数据，显著提升了临床决策质量。

Abstract: Timely and personalized treatment decisions are essential across a wide range
of healthcare settings where patient responses vary significantly and evolve
over time. Clinical data used to support these decisions are often irregularly
sampled, sparse, and noisy. Existing decision support systems commonly rely on
discretization and imputation, which can distort critical temporal dynamics and
degrade decision quality. Moreover, they often overlook the clinical
significance of irregular recording frequencies, filtering out patterns in how
and when data is collected. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a natural fit for
clinical decision-making, enabling sequential, long-term optimization in
dynamic, uncertain environments. However, most existing treatment
recommendation systems are model-free and trained solely on offline data,
making them sample-inefficient, sensitive to data quality, and poorly
generalizable across tasks or cohorts. To address these limitations, we propose
MedDreamer, a two-phase model-based RL framework for personalized treatment
recommendation. MedDreamer uses a world model with an Adaptive Feature
Integration (AFI) module to effectively model irregular, sparse clinical data.
Through latent imagination, it simulates plausible patient trajectories to
enhance learning, refining its policy using a mix of real and imagined
experiences. This enables learning policies that go beyond suboptimal
historical decisions while remaining grounded in clinical data. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of latent imagination to irregular
healthcare data. Evaluations on sepsis and mechanical ventilation (MV)
treatment using two large-scale EHR datasets show that MedDreamer outperforms
both model-free and model-based baselines in clinical outcomes and off-policy
metrics.

Abstract: We study the problem of causal function estimation in the Proxy Causal
Learning (PCL) framework, where confounders are not observed but proxies for
the confounders are available. Two main approaches have been proposed: outcome
bridge-based and treatment bridge-based methods. In this work, we propose two
kernel-based doubly robust estimators that combine the strengths of both
approaches, and naturally handle continuous and high-dimensional variables. Our
identification strategy builds on a recent density ratio-free method for
treatment bridge-based PCL; furthermore, in contrast to previous approaches, it
does not require indicator functions or kernel smoothing over the treatment
variable. These properties make it especially well-suited for continuous or
high-dimensional treatments. By using kernel mean embeddings, we have
closed-form solutions and strong consistency guarantees. Our estimators
outperform existing methods on PCL benchmarks, including a prior doubly robust
method that requires both kernel smoothing and density ratio estimation.

Abstract: In many real-world applications of regression, conditional probability
estimation, and uncertainty quantification, exploiting symmetries rooted in
physics or geometry can dramatically improve generalization and sample
efficiency. While geometric deep learning has made significant empirical
advances by incorporating group-theoretic structure, less attention has been
given to statistical learning guarantees. In this paper, we introduce an
equivariant representation learning framework that simultaneously addresses
regression, conditional probability estimation, and uncertainty quantification
while providing first-of-its-kind non-asymptotic statistical learning
guarantees. Grounded in operator and group representation theory, our framework
approximates the spectral decomposition of the conditional expectation
operator, building representations that are both equivariant and disentangled
along independent symmetry subgroups. Empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets and real-world robotics applications confirm the potential of our
approach, matching or outperforming existing equivariant baselines in
regression while additionally providing well-calibrated parametric uncertainty
estimates.

Result: 实验表明，LAPA策略在满足隐私要求的同时提升了收敛性能。

Conclusion: LAPA策略有效平衡了隐私保护与系统效用，适用于非IID数据场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm based on
protecting data privacy of devices, which however, can still be broken by
gradient leakage attack via parameter inversion techniques. Differential
privacy (DP) technology reduces the risk of private data leakage by adding
artificial noise to the gradients, but detrimental to the FL utility at the
same time, especially in the scenario where the data is Non-Independent
Identically Distributed (Non-IID). Based on the impact of heterogeneous data on
aggregation performance, this paper proposes a Lightweight Adaptive Privacy
Allocation (LAPA) strategy, which assigns personalized privacy budgets to
devices in each aggregation round without transmitting any additional
information beyond gradients, ensuring both privacy protection and aggregation
efficiency. Furthermore, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
algorithm is employed to optimize the transmission power, in order to determine
the optimal timing at which the adaptively attenuated artificial noise aligns
with the communication noise, enabling an effective balance between DP and
system utility. Finally, a reliable aggregation strategy is designed by
integrating communication quality and data distribution characteristics, which
improves aggregation performance while preserving privacy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the personalized noise allocation and dynamic optimization
strategy based on LAPA proposed in this paper enhances convergence performance
while satisfying the privacy requirements of FL.

Abstract: Current research on tabular foundation models often overlooks the
complexities of large-scale, real-world data by treating tables as isolated
entities and assuming information completeness, thereby neglecting the vital
operational context. To address this, we introduce the concept of Semantically
Linked Tables (SLT), recognizing that tables are inherently connected to both
declarative and procedural operational knowledge. We propose Foundation Models
for Semantically Linked Tables (FMSLT), which integrate these components to
ground tabular data within its true operational context. This comprehensive
representation unlocks the full potential of machine learning for complex,
interconnected tabular data across diverse domains. Realizing FMSLTs requires
access to operational knowledge that is often unavailable in public datasets,
highlighting the need for close collaboration between domain experts and
researchers. Our work exposes the limitations of current tabular foundation
models and proposes a new direction centered on FMSLTs, aiming to advance
robust, context-aware models for structured data.

Conclusion: 标准初始化方法在长序列中可能失效，需发展新的稳定初始化理论。

Abstract: Proper initialization is critical for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),
particularly in long-range reasoning tasks, where repeated application of the
same weight matrix can cause vanishing or exploding signals. A common baseline
for linear recurrences is Glorot initialization, designed to ensure stable
signal propagation--but derived under the infinite-width, fixed-length
regime--an unrealistic setting for RNNs processing long sequences. In this
work, we show that Glorot initialization is in fact unstable: small positive
deviations in the spectral radius are amplified through time and cause the
hidden state to explode. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that sequences
of length $t = O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the hidden width, are sufficient to
induce instability. To address this, we propose a simple, dimension-aware
rescaling of Glorot that shifts the spectral radius slightly below one,
preventing rapid signal explosion or decay. These results suggest that standard
initialization schemes may break down in the long-sequence regime, motivating a
separate line of theory for stable recurrent initialization.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train models across decentralized clients or
devices holding local data without the need for centralized data collection,
thus enhancing data privacy and security. However, achieving both
generalization and personalization in heterogeneous settings remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce FedOT, a novel approach
that leverages black-box foundation models. FedOT shares only a global
task-dependent classifier across clients while locally adapting features
through orthogonal transformations. By enforcing orthogonality, FedOT mitigates
gradient conflicts across diverse clients, preserves semantic integrity, and
achieves robust performance even in the presence of substantial data
heterogeneity. The strategy of combining global and local parameters enables a
more balanced approach for both generalization and personalization,
outperforming baseline FL methods across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our
extensive analysis confirms that joint optimization of global classifiers and
local orthogonal transformations yields superior performance and suggests
broader applicability.

verification, while still delivering promising performance. In this paper, we

We evaluate our method on five benchmark datasets, including a newly

Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication enhances transmission efficiency by
conveying semantic information rather than exact messages. Deep learning
(DL)-based semantic communication can effectively cultivate the essential
semantic knowledge for semantic extraction, transmission, and interpretation by
leveraging massive labeled samples for downstream task training. In this paper,
we propose a self-supervised learning-based semantic communication framework
(SLSCom) to enhance task inference performance, particularly in scenarios with
limited access to labeled samples. Specifically, we develop a task-relevant
semantic encoder using unlabeled samples, which can be collected by devices in
real-world edge networks. To facilitate task-relevant semantic extraction, we
introduce self-supervision for learning contrastive features and formulate the
information bottleneck (IB) problem to balance the tradeoff between the
informativeness of the extracted features and task inference performance. Given
the computational challenges of the IB problem, we devise a practical and
effective solution by employing self-supervised classification and
reconstruction pretext tasks. We further propose efficient joint training
methods to enhance end-to-end inference accuracy over wireless channels, even
with few labeled samples. We evaluate the proposed framework on image
classification tasks over multipath wireless channels. Extensive simulation
results demonstrate that SLSCom significantly outperforms conventional digital
coding methods and existing DL-based approaches across varying labeled data set
sizes and SNR conditions, even when the unlabeled samples are irrelevant to the
downstream tasks.

Abstract: We study the problem of offline imitation learning in Markov decision
processes (MDPs), where the goal is to learn a well-performing policy given a
dataset of state-action pairs generated by an expert policy. Complementing a
recent line of work on this topic that assumes the expert belongs to a
tractable class of known policies, we approach this problem from a new angle
and leverage a different type of structural assumption about the environment.
Specifically, for the class of linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs, we introduce a
new algorithm called saddle-point offline imitation learning (\SPOIL), which is
guaranteed to match the performance of any expert up to an additive error
$\varepsilon$ with access to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples. Moreover,
we extend this result to possibly non-linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs at the
cost of a worse sample complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$.
Finally, our analysis suggests a new loss function for training critic networks
from expert data in deep imitation learning. Empirical evaluations on standard
benchmarks demonstrate that the neural net implementation of \SPOIL is superior
to behavior cloning and competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms.

Abstract: Fully decentralized training of machine learning models offers significant
advantages in scalability, robustness, and fault tolerance. However, achieving
differential privacy (DP) in such settings is challenging due to the absence of
a central aggregator and varying trust assumptions among nodes. In this work,
we present a novel privacy analysis of decentralized gossip-based averaging
algorithms with additive node-level noise, both with and without secure
summation over each node's direct neighbors. Our main contribution is a new
analytical framework based on a linear systems formulation that accurately
characterizes privacy leakage across these scenarios. This framework
significantly improves upon prior analyses, for example, reducing the R\'enyi
DP parameter growth from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the number of
training rounds. We validate our analysis with numerical results demonstrating
superior DP bounds compared to existing approaches. We further illustrate our
analysis with a logistic regression experiment on MNIST image classification in
a fully decentralized setting, demonstrating utility comparable to central
aggregation methods.

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) offer a computationally scalable framework for
generative modeling, supporting exact and efficient inference of a wide range
of probabilistic queries. While recent advances have significantly improved the
expressiveness and scalability of PCs, effectively training their parameters
remains a challenge. In particular, a widely used optimization method,
full-batch Expectation-Maximization (EM), requires processing the entire
dataset before performing a single update, making it ineffective for large
datasets. While empirical extensions to the mini-batch setting have been
proposed, it remains unclear what objective these algorithms are optimizing,
making it difficult to assess their theoretical soundness. This paper bridges
the gap by establishing a novel connection between the general EM objective and
the standard full-batch EM algorithm. Building on this, we derive a
theoretically grounded generalization to the mini-batch setting and demonstrate
its effectiveness through preliminary empirical results.

regularization. However, these methods often set ad hoc regularization weights
and overlook imbalanced task-relevant information across modalities, limiting
their ability to achieve optimal MIB. To address this gap, we propose a novel
multimodal learning framework, Optimal Multimodal Information Bottleneck
(OMIB), whose optimization objective guarantees the achievability of optimal
MIB by setting the regularization weight within a theoretically derived bound.
OMIB further addresses imbalanced task-relevant information by dynamically
adjusting regularization weights per modality, promoting the inclusion of all
task-relevant information. Moreover, we establish a solid
information-theoretical foundation for OMIB's optimization and implement it
under the variational approximation framework for computational efficiency.
Finally, we empirically validate the OMIB's theoretical properties on synthetic
data and demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art benchmark
methods in various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a mathematically supported technique for data
compression. It consists of applying some kind of a Low Rank Decomposition
technique on the tensors or matrices in order to reduce the redundancy of the
data. However, it is not a popular technique for compressing the AI models duo
to the high number of new layers added to the architecture after decomposition.
Although the number of parameters could shrink significantly, it could result
in the model be more than twice deeper which could add some latency to the
training or inference. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study about
how to modify low rank decomposition technique in AI models so that we could
benefit from both high accuracy and low memory consumption as well as speeding
up the training and inference

enhances the overall reconstruction quality. GIT consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple datasets and demonstrates strong robustness

Abstract: We observe a novel 'multiple-descent' phenomenon during the training process

multiple times after the model is overtrained. By carrying out asymptotic
stability analysis of the models, we found that the cycles in test loss are
closely associated with the phase transition process between order and chaos,

between the two phases. More importantly, the global optimal epoch occurs at
the first transition from order to chaos, where the 'width' of the 'edge of

Abstract: Dynamics modeling has been introduced as a novel paradigm in message passing
(MP) of graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing methods consider MP between
nodes as a heat diffusion process, and leverage heat equation to model the
temporal evolution of nodes in the embedding space. However, heat equation can
hardly depict the wave nature of graph signals in graph signal processing.
Besides, heat equation is essentially a partial differential equation (PDE)
involving a first partial derivative of time, whose numerical solution usually
has low stability, and leads to inefficient model training. In this paper, we
would like to depict more wave details in MP, since graph signals are
essentially wave signals that can be seen as a superposition of a series of
waves in the form of eigenvector. This motivates us to consider MP as a wave
propagation process to capture the temporal evolution of wave signals in the
space. Based on wave equation in physics, we innovatively develop a graph wave
equation to leverage the wave propagation on graphs. In details, we demonstrate
that the graph wave equation can be connected to traditional spectral GNNs,
facilitating the design of graph wave networks based on various Laplacians and
enhancing the performance of the spectral GNNs. Besides, the graph wave
equation is particularly a PDE involving a second partial derivative of time,
which has stronger stability on graphs than the heat equation that involves a
first partial derivative of time. Additionally, we theoretically prove that the
numerical solution derived from the graph wave equation are constantly stable,
enabling to significantly enhance model efficiency while ensuring its
performance. Extensive experiments show that GWNs achieve SOTA and efficient
performance on benchmark datasets, and exhibit outstanding performance in
addressing challenging graph problems, such as over-smoothing and heterophily.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管蛋白质语言模型（PLMs）在蛋白质结构和功能预测中表现出色，但在PPI结合亲和力预测中的应用仍存在不足，主要受限于数据集质量和简单的表示拼接策略。

Method: 论文引入了经过严格筛选的PPB-Affinity数据集，并提出了四种架构（EC、SC、HP、PAD）和两种训练方法（全微调和轻量级方法），以优化PLMs在PPI预测中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，HP和PAD架构在多个PLMs上表现最佳，Spearman相关系数提升了12%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了复杂架构设计对充分发挥PLMs在PPI预测中潜力的重要性。

Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental to numerous cellular
processes, and their characterization is vital for understanding disease
mechanisms and guiding drug discovery. While protein language models (PLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting protein structure and
function, their application to sequence-based PPI binding affinity prediction
remains relatively underexplored. This gap is often attributed to the scarcity
of high-quality, rigorously refined datasets and the reliance on simple
strategies for concatenating protein representations. In this work, we address
these limitations. First, we introduce a meticulously curated version of the
PPB-Affinity dataset of a total of 8,207 unique protein-protein interaction
entries, by resolving annotation inconsistencies and duplicate entries for
multi-chain protein interactions. This dataset incorporates a stringent, less
than or equal to 30%, sequence identity threshold to ensure robust splitting
into training, validation, and test sets, minimizing data leakage. Second, we
propose and systematically evaluate four architectures for adapting PLMs to PPI
binding affinity prediction: embeddings concatenation (EC), sequences
concatenation (SC), hierarchical pooling (HP), and pooled attention addition
(PAD). These architectures were assessed using two training methods: full
fine-tuning and a lightweight approach employing ConvBERT heads over frozen PLM
features. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple leading PLMs (ProtT5,
ESM2, Ankh, Ankh2, and ESM3) demonstrated that the HP and PAD architectures
consistently outperform conventional concatenation methods, achieving up to 12%
increase in terms of Spearman correlation. These results highlight the
necessity of sophisticated architectural designs to fully exploit the
capabilities of PLMs for nuanced PPI binding affinity prediction.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools to detect
complex patterns of protein sequences. However, the capability of PLMs to fully
capture information on protein sequences might be limited by focusing on single
pre-training tasks. Although adding data modalities or supervised objectives
can improve the performance of PLMs, pre-training often remains focused on
denoising corrupted sequences. To push the boundaries of PLMs, our research
investigated a multi-task pre-training strategy. We developed Ankh3, a model
jointly optimized on two objectives: masked language modeling with multiple
masking probabilities and protein sequence completion relying only on protein
sequences as input. This multi-task pre-training demonstrated that PLMs can
learn richer and more generalizable representations solely from protein
sequences. The results demonstrated improved performance in downstream tasks,
such as secondary structure prediction, fluorescence, GB1 fitness, and contact
prediction. The integration of multiple tasks gave the model a more
comprehensive understanding of protein properties, leading to more robust and
accurate predictions.

Abstract: Graph Neural Network-based methods face privacy leakage risks due to the
introduction of topological structures about the targets, which allows
attackers to bypass the target's prior knowledge of the sensitive attributes
and realize membership inference attacks (MIA) by observing and analyzing the
topology distribution. As privacy concerns grow, the assumption of MIA, which
presumes that attackers can obtain an auxiliary dataset with the same
distribution, is increasingly deviating from reality. In this paper, we
categorize the distribution diversity issue in real-world MIA scenarios as an
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) problem, and propose a novel Graph OOD Membership
Inference Attack (GOOD-MIA) to achieve cross-domain graph attacks.
Specifically, we construct shadow subgraphs with distributions from different
domains to model the diversity of real-world data. We then explore the stable
node representations that remain unchanged under external influences and
consider eliminating redundant information from confounding environments and
extracting task-relevant key information to more clearly distinguish between
the characteristics of training data and unseen data. This OOD-based design
makes cross-domain graph attacks possible. Finally, we perform risk
extrapolation to optimize the attack's domain adaptability during attack
inference to generalize the attack to other domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that GOOD-MIA achieves superior attack performance in datasets
designed for multiple domains.

Abstract: Neural networks are vulnerable to privacy attacks aimed at stealing sensitive
data. The risks can be amplified in a real-world scenario, particularly when
models are trained on limited and biased data. In this work, we investigate the
impact of spurious correlation bias on privacy vulnerability. We introduce
\emph{spurious privacy leakage}, a phenomenon where spurious groups are
significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks than non-spurious groups. We
further show that group privacy disparity increases in tasks with simpler
objectives (e.g. fewer classes) due to the persistence of spurious features.
Surprisingly, we find that reducing spurious correlation using spurious robust
methods does not mitigate spurious privacy leakage. This leads us to introduce
a perspective on privacy disparity based on memorization, where mitigating
spurious correlation does not mitigate the memorization of spurious data, and
therefore, neither the privacy level. Lastly, we compare the privacy of
different model architectures trained with spurious data, demonstrating that,
contrary to prior works, architectural choice can affect privacy outcomes.

Abstract: As protein informatics advances rapidly, the demand for enhanced predictive
accuracy, structural analysis, and functional understanding has intensified.
Transformer models, as powerful deep learning architectures, have demonstrated
unprecedented potential in addressing diverse challenges across protein

systematically covers critical domains, including protein structure prediction,
function prediction, protein-protein interaction analysis, functional
annotation, and drug discovery/target identification. To contextualize these
advancements across various protein domains, we adopt a domain-oriented
classification system. We first introduce foundational concepts: the
Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms, categorize Transformer
variants tailored for protein science, and summarize essential protein
knowledge. For each research domain, we outline its objectives and background,
critically evaluate prior methods and their limitations, and highlight
transformative contributions enabled by Transformer models. We also curate and
summarize pivotal datasets and open-source code resources to facilitate
reproducibility and benchmarking. Finally, we discuss persistent challenges in
applying Transformers to protein informatics and propose future research
directions. This review aims to provide a consolidated foundation for the

Conclusion: TNNs deserve more attention for their unique properties, with research needed to address scaling and adoption barriers.

Abstract: Tensorizing a neural network involves reshaping some or all of its dense
weight matrices into higher-order tensors and approximating them using low-rank
tensor network decompositions. This technique has shown promise as a model
compression strategy for large-scale neural networks. However, despite
encouraging empirical results, tensorized neural networks (TNNs) remain
underutilized in mainstream deep learning. In this position paper, we offer a
perspective on both the potential and current limitations of TNNs. We argue
that TNNs represent a powerful yet underexplored framework for deep
learning--one that deserves greater attention from both engineering and
theoretical communities. Beyond compression, we highlight the value of TNNs as
a flexible class of architectures with distinctive scaling properties and
increased interpretability. A central feature of TNNs is the presence of bond
indices, which introduce new latent spaces not found in conventional networks.
These internal representations may provide deeper insight into the evolution of
features across layers, potentially advancing the goals of mechanistic
interpretability. We conclude by outlining several key research directions
aimed at overcoming the practical barriers to scaling and adopting TNNs in
modern deep learning workflows.

Abstract: Replay-based continual learning (CL) methods assume that models trained on a
small subset can also effectively minimize the empirical risk of the complete
dataset. These methods maintain a memory buffer that stores a sampled subset of
data from previous tasks to consolidate past knowledge. However, this
assumption is not guaranteed in practice due to the limited capacity of the
memory buffer and the heuristic criteria used for buffer data selection. To
address this issue, we propose a new dataset distillation framework tailored
for CL, which maintains a learnable memory buffer to distill the global
information from the current task data and accumulated knowledge preserved in
the previous memory buffer. Moreover, to avoid the computational overhead and
overfitting risks associated with parameterizing the entire buffer during
distillation, we introduce a lightweight distillation module that can achieve
global information distillation solely by generating learnable soft labels for
the memory buffer data. Extensive experiments show that, our method can achieve
competitive results and effectively mitigates forgetting across various
datasets. The source code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Multiset functions, which are functions that map multisets to vectors, are a
fundamental tool in the construction of neural networks for multisets and
graphs. To guarantee that the vector representation of the multiset is
faithful, it is often desirable to have multiset mappings that are both
injective and bi-Lipschitz. Currently, there are several constructions of
multiset functions achieving both these guarantees, leading to improved
performance in some tasks but often also to higher compute time than standard
constructions. Accordingly, it is natural to inquire whether simpler multiset
functions achieving the same guarantees are available. In this paper, we make a
large step towards giving a negative answer to this question. We consider the
family of k-ary Janossy pooling, which includes many of the most popular
multiset models, and prove that no piecewise linear Janossy pooling function
can be injective. On the positive side, we show that when restricted to
multisets without multiplicities, even simple deep-sets models suffice for
injectivity and bi-Lipschitzness.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of gradient flow with small weight decay on general
training losses $F: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$. Under mild regularity
assumptions and assuming convergence of the unregularised gradient flow, we
show that the trajectory with weight decay $\lambda$ exhibits a two-phase
behaviour as $\lambda \to 0$. During the initial fast phase, the trajectory
follows the unregularised gradient flow and converges to a manifold of critical
points of $F$. Then, at time of order $1/\lambda$, the trajectory enters a slow
drift phase and follows a Riemannian gradient flow minimising the $\ell_2$-norm
of the parameters. This purely optimisation-based phenomenon offers a natural
explanation for the \textit{grokking} effect observed in deep learning, where
the training loss rapidly reaches zero while the test loss plateaus for an
extended period before suddenly improving. We argue that this generalisation
jump can be attributed to the slow norm reduction induced by weight decay, as
explained by our analysis. We validate this mechanism empirically on several
synthetic regression tasks.

Abstract: Inspired by recent work on learning with distribution shift, we give a
general outlier removal algorithm called iterative polynomial filtering and
show a number of striking applications for supervised learning with
contamination: (1) We show that any function class that can be approximated by
low-degree polynomials with respect to a hypercontractive distribution can be
efficiently learned under bounded contamination (also known as nasty noise).
This is a surprising resolution to a longstanding gap between the complexity of
agnostic learning and learning with contamination, as it was widely believed
that low-degree approximators only implied tolerance to label noise. (2) For
any function class that admits the (stronger) notion of sandwiching
approximators, we obtain near-optimal learning guarantees even with respect to
heavy additive contamination, where far more than $1/2$ of the training set may
be added adversarially. Prior related work held only for regression and in a
list-decodable setting. (3) We obtain the first efficient algorithms for
tolerant testable learning of functions of halfspaces with respect to any fixed
log-concave distribution. Even the non-tolerant case for a single halfspace in
this setting had remained open. These results significantly advance our
understanding of efficient supervised learning under contamination, a setting
that has been much less studied than its unsupervised counterpart.

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning holds immense potential for collaboratively
training models from multiple sources without sharing raw data, addressing both
data scarcity and privacy concerns, two key challenges in healthcare. A major
challenge in training multimodal federated models in healthcare is the presence
of missing modalities due to multiple reasons, including variations in clinical
practice, cost and accessibility constraints, retrospective data collection,
privacy concerns, and occasional technical or human errors. Previous methods
typically rely on publicly available real datasets or synthetic data to
compensate for missing modalities. However, obtaining real datasets for every
disease is impractical, and training generative models to synthesize missing
modalities is computationally expensive and prone to errors due to the high
dimensionality of medical data. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight,
low-dimensional feature translator to reconstruct bottleneck features of the
missing modalities. Our experiments on three different datasets (MIMIC-CXR, NIH
Open-I, and CheXpert), in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings
consistently improve the performance of competitive baselines. The code and

Conclusion: BrainOmni是首个支持EEG和MEG的基础模型，展示了跨模态联合训练的潜力。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural
activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by
dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit
distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor
configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches
typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits
the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni,
the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and
MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the
first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete
representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that
encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type,
enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the
discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain
signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the
first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG
and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available
sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both
existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range
of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG
and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training
yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and model
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Controlling the flight of flapping-wing drones requires versatile controllers
that handle their time-varying, nonlinear, and underactuated dynamics from
incomplete and noisy sensor data. Model-based methods struggle with accurate
modeling, while model-free approaches falter in efficiently navigating very
high-dimensional and nonlinear control objective landscapes. This article
presents a novel hybrid model-free/model-based approach to flight control based
on the recently proposed reinforcement twinning algorithm. The model-based (MB)
approach relies on an adjoint formulation using an adaptive digital twin,
continuously identified from live trajectories, while the model-free (MF)
approach relies on reinforcement learning. The two agents collaborate through
transfer learning, imitation learning, and experience sharing using the real
environment, the digital twin and a referee. The latter selects the best agent
to interact with the real environment based on performance within the digital
twin and a real-to-virtual environment consistency ratio. The algorithm is
evaluated for controlling the longitudinal dynamics of a flapping-wing drone,
with the environment simulated as a nonlinear, time-varying dynamical system
under the influence of quasi-steady aerodynamic forces. The hybrid control
learning approach is tested with three types of initialization of the adaptive
model: (1) offline identification using previously available data, (2) random
initialization with full online identification, and (3) offline pre-training
with an estimation bias, followed by online adaptation. In all three scenarios,
the proposed hybrid learning approach demonstrates superior performance
compared to purely model-free and model-based methods.

Abstract: In scientific research, limitations refer to the shortcomings, constraints,
or weaknesses within a study. Transparent reporting of such limitations can
enhance the quality and reproducibility of research and improve public trust in
science. However, authors often a) underreport them in the paper text and b)
use hedging strategies to satisfy editorial requirements at the cost of
readers' clarity and confidence. This underreporting behavior, along with an
explosion in the number of publications, has created a pressing need to
automatically extract or generate such limitations from scholarly papers. In
this direction, we present a complete architecture for the computational
analysis of research limitations. Specifically, we create a dataset of
limitations in ACL, NeurIPS, and PeerJ papers by extracting them from papers'
text and integrating them with external reviews; we propose methods to
automatically generate them using a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
technique; we create a fine-grained evaluation framework for generated
limitations; and we provide a meta-evaluation for the proposed evaluation

Abstract: Performativity of predictions refers to the phenomena that
prediction-informed decisions may influence the target they aim to predict,
which is widely observed in policy-making in social sciences and economics. In
this paper, we initiate the study of statistical inference under
performativity. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we build a central limit
theorem for estimation and inference under performativity, which enables
inferential purposes in policy-making such as constructing confidence intervals
or testing hypotheses. Second, we further leverage the derived central limit
theorem to investigate prediction-powered inference (PPI) under performativity,
which is based on a small labeled dataset and a much larger dataset of
machine-learning predictions. This enables us to obtain more precise estimation
and improved confidence regions for the model parameter (i.e., policy) of
interest in performative prediction. We demonstrate the power of our framework
by numerical experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first
one to establish statistical inference under performativity, which brings up
new challenges and inference settings that we believe will add significant
values to policy-making, statistics, and machine learning.

Abstract: Kernels are key to encoding prior beliefs and data structures in Gaussian
process (GP) models. The design of expressive and scalable kernels has garnered
significant research attention. Deep kernel learning enhances kernel
flexibility by feeding inputs through a neural network before applying a
standard parametric form. However, this approach remains limited by the choice
of base kernels, inherits high inference costs, and often demands sparse
approximations. Drawing on Mercer's theorem, we introduce a fully data-driven,
scalable deep kernel representation where a neural network directly represents
a low-rank kernel through a small set of basis functions. This construction
enables highly efficient exact GP inference in linear time and memory without
invoking inducing points. It also supports scalable mini-batch training based
on a principled variational inference framework. We further propose a simple
variance correction procedure to guard against overconfidence in uncertainty
estimates. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the
advantages of our deep kernel GP in terms of predictive accuracy, uncertainty
quantification, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Deep learning with noisy labels presents significant challenges. In this
work, we theoretically characterize the role of label noise from a feature
learning perspective. Specifically, we consider a signal-noise data
distribution, where each sample comprises a label-dependent signal and
label-independent noise, and rigorously analyze the training dynamics of a
two-layer convolutional neural network under this data setup, along with the
presence of label noise. Our analysis identifies two key stages. In Stage I,
the model perfectly fits all the clean samples (i.e., samples without label
noise) while ignoring the noisy ones (i.e., samples with noisy labels). During
this stage, the model learns the signal from the clean samples, which
generalizes well on unseen data. In Stage II, as the training loss converges,
the gradient in the direction of noise surpasses that of the signal, leading to
overfitting on noisy samples. Eventually, the model memorizes the noise present
in the noisy samples and degrades its generalization ability. Furthermore, our
analysis provides a theoretical basis for two widely used techniques for
tackling label noise: early stopping and sample selection. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world setups validate our theory.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in scientific machine learning is
increasingly critical as neural networks are widely adopted to tackle complex
problems across diverse scientific disciplines. For physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), a prominent model in scientific machine learning, uncertainty
is typically quantified using Bayesian or dropout methods. However, both
approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: the prior distribution or
dropout rate required to construct honest confidence sets cannot be determined
without additional information. In this paper, we propose a novel method within
the framework of extended fiducial inference (EFI) to provide rigorous
uncertainty quantification for PINNs. The proposed method leverages a
narrow-neck hyper-network to learn the parameters of the PINN and quantify
their uncertainty based on imputed random errors in the observations. This
approach overcomes the limitations of Bayesian and dropout methods, enabling
the construction of honest confidence sets based solely on observed data. This
advancement represents a significant breakthrough for PINNs, greatly enhancing
their reliability, interpretability, and applicability to real-world scientific
and engineering challenges. Moreover, it establishes a new theoretical
framework for EFI, extending its application to large-scale models, eliminating
the need for sparse hyper-networks, and significantly improving the
automaticity and robustness of statistical inference.

Abstract: Guidance is a cornerstone of modern diffusion models, playing a pivotal role
in conditional generation and enhancing the quality of unconditional samples.
However, current approaches to guidance scheduling--determining the appropriate
guidance weight--are largely heuristic and lack a solid theoretical foundation.
This work addresses these limitations on two fronts. First, we provide a
theoretical formalization that precisely characterizes the relationship between
guidance strength and classifier confidence. Second, building on this insight,
we introduce a stochastic optimal control framework that casts guidance
scheduling as an adaptive optimization problem. In this formulation, guidance
strength is not fixed but dynamically selected based on time, the current
sample, and the conditioning class, either independently or in combination. By
solving the resulting control problem, we establish a principled foundation for
more effective guidance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Latent variables (LVs) play a crucial role in encoder-decoder models by
enabling effective data compression, prediction, and generation. Although their
theoretical properties, such as generalization, have been extensively studied
in supervised learning, similar analyses for unsupervised models such as
variational autoencoders (VAEs) remain insufficiently underexplored. In this
work, we extend information-theoretic generalization analysis to
vector-quantized (VQ) VAEs with discrete latent spaces, introducing a novel
data-dependent prior to rigorously analyze the relationship among LVs,
generalization, and data generation. We derive a novel generalization error
bound of the reconstruction loss of VQ-VAEs, which depends solely on the
complexity of LVs and the encoder, independent of the decoder. Additionally, we
provide the upper bound of the 2-Wasserstein distance between the distributions
of the true data and the generated data, explaining how the regularization of
the LVs contributes to the data generation performance.

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is a core challenge in urban mobility, where
real-time decisions must balance efficiency and safety. Existing methods -
ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often
struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We
introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language
meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first
image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at
intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type,
motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a
safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for
routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the
latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize
emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight
reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems,
while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1%
degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware
solution for next-generation traffic signal control.

Abstract: Learning unknown dynamics under environmental (or external) constraints is
fundamental to many fields (e.g., modern robotics), particularly challenging
when constraint information is only locally available and uncertain. Existing
approaches requiring global constraints or using probabilistic filtering fail
to fully exploit the geometric structure inherent in local measurements (by
using, e.g., sensors) and constraints. This paper presents a geometric
framework unifying measurements, constraints, and dynamics learning through a
fiber bundle structure over the state space. This naturally induced geometric
structure enables measurement-aware Control Barrier Functions that adapt to
local sensing (or measurement) conditions. By integrating Neural ODEs, our
framework learns continuous-time dynamics while preserving geometric
constraints, with theoretical guarantees of learning convergence and constraint
satisfaction dependent on sensing quality. The geometric framework not only
enables efficient dynamics learning but also suggests promising directions for
integration with reinforcement learning approaches. Extensive simulations
demonstrate significant improvements in both learning efficiency and constraint
satisfaction over traditional methods, especially under limited and uncertain
sensing conditions.

Abstract: Since Polyak's pioneering work, heavy ball (HB) momentum has been widely
studied in minimization. However, its role in min-max games remains largely
unexplored. As a key component of practical min-max algorithms like Adam, this
gap limits their effectiveness. In this paper, we present a continuous-time
analysis for HB with simultaneous and alternating update schemes in min-max
games. Locally, we prove smaller momentum enhances algorithmic stability by
enabling local convergence across a wider range of step sizes, with alternating
updates generally converging faster. Globally, we study the implicit
regularization of HB, and find smaller momentum guides algorithms trajectories
towards shallower slope regions of the loss landscapes, with alternating
updates amplifying this effect. Surprisingly, all these phenomena differ from
those observed in minimization, where larger momentum yields similar effects.
Our results reveal fundamental differences between HB in min-max games and
minimization, and numerical experiments further validate our theoretical
results.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the often-overlooked issue of embedding collapse
in existing diffusion-based sequential recommendation models and propose ADRec,
an innovative framework designed to mitigate this problem. Diverging from
previous diffusion-based methods, ADRec applies an independent noise process to
each token and performs diffusion across the entire target sequence during
training. ADRec captures token interdependency through auto-regression while
modeling per-token distributions through token-level diffusion. This dual
approach enables the model to effectively capture both sequence dynamics and
item representations, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. To
further mitigate embedding collapse, we propose a three-stage training
strategy: (1) pre-training the embedding weights, (2) aligning these weights
with the ADRec backbone, and (3) fine-tuning the model. During inference, ADRec
applies the denoising process only to the last token, ensuring that the
meaningful patterns in historical interactions are preserved. Our comprehensive
empirical evaluation across six datasets underscores the effectiveness of ADRec
in enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of diffusion-based sequential
recommendation systems.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed malicious triggers into training data, enabling
attackers to manipulate neural network behavior during inference while
maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs. However, existing backdoor attacks
face limitations manifesting in excessive reliance on training data, poor
stealth, and instability, which hinder their effectiveness in real-world

backdoor attack that targets feature embeddings within neural networks to
achieve high ASRs and stealthiness. Unlike traditional approaches, ShadowPrint
reduces reliance on training data access and operates effectively with
exceedingly low poison rates (as low as 0.01%). It leverages a clustering-based
optimization strategy to align feature embeddings, ensuring robust performance
across diverse scenarios while maintaining stability and stealth. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ShadowPrint achieves superior ASR (up to 100%),
steady CA (with decay no more than 1% in most cases), and low DDR (averaging
below 5%) across both clean-label and dirty-label settings, and with poison
rates ranging from as low as 0.01% to 0.05%, setting a new standard for
backdoor attack capabilities and emphasizing the need for advanced defense
strategies focused on feature space manipulations.

Abstract: This work is focussed on the inversion task of inferring the distribution
over parameters of interest leading to multiple sets of observations. The
potential to solve such distributional inversion problems is driven by
increasing availability of data, but a major roadblock is blind deconvolution,
arising when the observational noise distribution is unknown. However, when
data originates from collections of physical systems, a population, it is
possible to leverage this information to perform deconvolution. To this end, we
propose a methodology leveraging large data sets of observations, collected
from different instantiations of the same physical processes, to simultaneously
deconvolve the data corrupting noise distribution, and to identify the
distribution over model parameters defining the physical processes. A
parameter-dependent mathematical model of the physical process is employed. A
loss function characterizing the match between the observed data and the output
of the mathematical model is defined; it is minimized as a function of the both
the parameter inputs to the model of the physics and the parameterized
observational noise. This coupled problem is addressed with a modified gradient
descent algorithm that leverages specific structure in the noise model.
Furthermore, a new active learning scheme is proposed, based on adaptive
empirical measures, to train a surrogate model to be accurate in parameter
regions of interest; this approach accelerates computation and enables
automatic differentiation of black-box, potentially nondifferentiable, code
computing parameter-to-solution maps. The proposed methodology is demonstrated
on porous medium flow, damped elastodynamics, and simplified models of
atmospheric dynamics.

Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a popular strategy for combining
gold-standard and possibly noisy pseudo-labels to perform statistical
estimation. Prior work has shown an asymptotic "free lunch" for PPI++, an
adaptive form of PPI, showing that the *asymptotic* variance of PPI++ is always
less than or equal to the variance obtained from using gold-standard labels
alone. Notably, this result holds *regardless of the quality of the
pseudo-labels*. In this work, we demystify this result by conducting an exact
finite-sample analysis of the estimation error of PPI++ on the mean estimation
problem. We give a "no free lunch" result, characterizing the settings (and
sample sizes) where PPI++ has provably worse estimation error than using
gold-standard labels alone. Specifically, PPI++ will outperform if and only if
the correlation between pseudo- and gold-standard is above a certain level that
depends on the number of labeled samples ($n$). In some cases our results
simplify considerably: For Gaussian data, the correlation must be at least
$1/\sqrt{n - 2}$ in order to see improvement, and a similar result holds for
binary labels. In experiments, we illustrate that our theoretical findings hold
on real-world datasets, and give insights into trade-offs between single-sample
and sample-splitting variants of PPI++.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting human emotional and physiological states using
wearable sensors has important applications in stress monitoring, mental health
assessment, and affective computing. This study presents a novel Multi-Task
Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) that performs Electrodermal Activity
(EDA) prediction and emotion classification simultaneously, using the publicly
available WESAD dataset. The model integrates psychological self-report
features (PANAS and SAM) with a physics-inspired differential equation
representing EDA dynamics, enforcing biophysically grounded constraints through
a custom loss function. This loss combines EDA regression, emotion
classification, and a physics residual term for improved interpretability.
  The architecture supports dual outputs for both tasks and is trained under a
unified multi-task framework. Evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, the
model achieves an average EDA RMSE of 0.0362, Pearson correlation of 0.9919,
and F1-score of 94.08 percent. These results outperform classical models such
as SVR and XGBoost, as well as ablated variants like emotion-only and EDA-only
models.
  In addition, the learned physical parameters including decay rate (alpha_0),
emotional sensitivity (beta), and time scaling (gamma) are interpretable and
stable across folds, aligning with known principles of human physiology. This
work is the first to introduce a multi-task PINN framework for wearable emotion
recognition, offering improved performance, generalizability, and model
transparency. The proposed system provides a foundation for future
interpretable and multimodal applications in healthcare and human-computer

Abstract: With the increasing availability of geospatial datasets, researchers have
explored region representation learning (RRL) to analyze complex region
characteristics. Recent RRL methods use contrastive learning (CL) to capture
shared information between two modalities but often overlook task-relevant
unique information specific to each modality. Such modality-specific details
can explain region characteristics that shared information alone cannot
capture. Bringing information factorization to RRL can address this by
factorizing multimodal data into shared and unique information. However,
existing factorization approaches focus on two modalities, whereas RRL can
benefit from various geospatial data. Extending factorization beyond two
modalities is non-trivial because modeling high-order relationships introduces
a combinatorial number of learning objectives, increasing model complexity. We
introduce Cross modal Knowledge Injected Embedding, an information
factorization approach for RRL that captures both shared and unique
representations. CooKIE uses a pairwise inter-view learning approach that
captures high-order information without modeling high-order dependency,
avoiding exhaustive combinations. We evaluate CooKIE on three regression tasks
and a land use classification task in New York City and Delhi, India. Results
show that CooKIE outperforms existing RRL methods and a factorized RRL model,
capturing multimodal information with fewer training parameters and
floating-point operations per second (FLOPs). We release the code:

Abstract: Euclidean Distance Matrix (EDM), which consists of pairwise squared Euclidean
distances of a given point configuration, finds many applications in modern
machine learning. This paper considers the setting where only a set of anchor
nodes is used to collect the distances between themselves and the rest. In the
presence of potential outliers, it results in a structured partial observation
on EDM with partial corruptions. Note that an EDM can be connected to a
positive semi-definite Gram matrix via a non-orthogonal dual basis. Inspired by
recent development of non-orthogonal dual basis in optimization, we propose a
novel algorithmic framework, dubbed Robust Euclidean Distance Geometry via Dual
Basis (RoDEoDB), for recovering the Euclidean distance geometry, i.e., the
underlying point configuration. The exact recovery guarantees have been
established in terms of both the Gram matrix and point configuration, under
some mild conditions. Empirical experiments show superior performance of
RoDEoDB on sensor localization and molecular conformation datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated success in geospatial applications,
yet quantifying the role of geolocation information in enhancing model
performance and geographic generalizability remains underexplored. A new
generation of location encoders have emerged with the goal of capturing
attributes present at any given location for downstream use in predictive
modeling. Being a nascent area of research, their evaluation has remained
largely limited to static tasks such as species distributions or average
temperature mapping. In this paper, we discuss and quantify the impact of
incorporating geolocation into deep learning for a real-world application
domain that is characteristically dynamic (with fast temporal change) and
spatially heterogeneous at high resolutions: estimating surface-level daily
PM2.5 levels using remotely sensed and ground-level data. We build on a
recently published deep learning-based PM2.5 estimation model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance on data observed in the contiguous United States.
We examine three approaches for incorporating geolocation: excluding
geolocation as a baseline, using raw geographic coordinates, and leveraging
pretrained location encoders. We evaluate each approach under within-region
(WR) and out-of-region (OoR) evaluation scenarios. Aggregate performance
metrics indicate that while na\"ive incorporation of raw geographic coordinates
improves within-region performance by retaining the interpolative value of
geographic location, it can hinder generalizability across regions. In
contrast, pretrained location encoders like GeoCLIP enhance predictive
performance and geographic generalizability for both WR and OoR scenarios.
However, qualitative analysis reveals artifact patterns caused by high-degree
basis functions and sparse upstream samples in certain areas, and ablation
results indicate varying performance among location encoders...

Abstract: Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) driven by random noise play
a central role in modelling physical processes whose spatio-temporal dynamics
can be rough, such as turbulence flows, superconductors, and quantum dynamics.
To efficiently model these processes and make predictions, machine learning
(ML)-based surrogate models are proposed, with their network architectures
incorporating the spatio-temporal roughness in their design. However, it lacks
an extensive and unified datasets for SPDE learning; especially, existing
datasets do not account for the computational error introduced by noise
sampling and the necessary renormalization required for handling singular
SPDEs. We thus introduce SPDEBench, which is designed to solve typical SPDEs of
physical significance (e.g., the $\Phi^4_d$, wave, incompressible
Navier--Stokes, and KdV equations) on 1D or 2D tori driven by white noise via
ML methods. New datasets for singular SPDEs based on the renormalization
process have been constructed, and novel ML models achieving the best results
to date have been proposed. In particular, we investigate the impact of
computational error introduced by noise sampling and renormalization on the
performance comparison of ML models and highlight the importance of selecting
high-quality test data for accurate evaluation. Results are benchmarked with
traditional numerical solvers and ML-based models, including FNO, NSPDE and
DLR-Net, etc. It is shown that, for singular SPDEs, naively applying ML models
on data without specifying the numerical schemes can lead to significant errors
and misleading conclusions. Our SPDEBench provides an open-source codebase that
ensures full reproducibility of benchmarking across a variety of SPDE datasets
while offering the flexibility to incorporate new datasets and machine learning
baselines, making it a valuable resource for the community.

Abstract: We study the convergence properties and escape dynamics of Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) in one-dimensional landscapes, separately considering
infinite- and finite-variance noise. Our main focus is to identify the time
scales on which SGD reliably moves from an initial point to the local minimum
in the same ''basin''. Under suitable conditions on the noise distribution, we
prove that SGD converges to the basin's minimum unless the initial point lies
too close to a local maximum. In that near-maximum scenario, we show that SGD
can linger for a long time in its neighborhood. For initial points near a
''sharp'' maximum, we show that SGD does not remain stuck there, and we provide
results to estimate the probability that it will reach each of the two
neighboring minima. Overall, our findings present a nuanced view of SGD's
transitions between local maxima and minima, influenced by both noise
characteristics and the underlying function geometry.

Abstract: The simulation of N-body systems is a fundamental problem with applications
in a wide range of fields, such as molecular dynamics, biochemistry, and
pedestrian dynamics. Machine learning has become an invaluable tool for scaling
physics-based simulators and developing models directly from experimental data.
In particular, recent advances based on deep generative modeling and geometric
deep learning have enabled probabilistic simulation by modeling complex
distributions over trajectories while respecting the permutation symmetry that
is fundamental to N-body systems. However, to generate realistic trajectories,
existing methods must learn complex transformations starting from uninformed
noise and do not allow for the exploitation of domain-informed priors. In this
work, we propose STFlow to address this limitation. By leveraging flow matching
and data-dependent couplings, STFlow facilitates physics-informed simulation of
geometric trajectories without sacrificing model expressivity or scalability.
Our evaluation on N-body dynamical systems, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian
dynamics benchmarks shows that STFlow produces significantly lower prediction
errors while enabling more efficient inference, highlighting the benefits of
employing physics-informed prior distributions in probabilistic geometric
trajectory modeling.

Abstract: The explicit governing equation is one of the simplest and most intuitive
forms for characterizing physical laws. However, directly discovering partial

in determining relevant terms from a vast search space. Symmetry, as a crucial
prior knowledge in scientific fields, has been widely applied in tasks such as
designing equivariant networks and guiding neural PDE solvers. In this paper,
we propose a pipeline for governing equation discovery based on differential
invariants, which can losslessly reduce the search space of existing equation
discovery methods while strictly adhering to symmetry. Specifically, we compute
the set of differential invariants corresponding to the infinitesimal
generators of the symmetry group and select them as the relevant terms for
equation discovery. Taking DI-SINDy (SINDy based on Differential Invariants) as
an example, we demonstrate that its success rate and accuracy in PDE discovery
surpass those of other symmetry-informed governing equation discovery methods
across a series of PDEs.

Motivation: 解决在线学习中的Pandora's Box问题，优化遗憾值并扩展到更复杂的上下文线性设置，以更好地适应实际应用。

Method: 提出了一种新算法，在非上下文和上下文线性设置中分别实现了较低的遗憾值，并扩展到在线Prophet Inequality问题。

Result: 算法在非上下文设置中实现了$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{nT})$遗憾值，优于现有结果；在上下文线性设置中实现了$\widetilde{O}(nd\sqrt{T})$遗憾值。

Conclusion: 论文提出的算法显著优化了在线学习中的遗憾值，并成功扩展到复杂场景，展示了广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We study the Pandora's Box problem in an online learning setting with
semi-bandit feedback. In each round, the learner sequentially pays to open up
to $n$ boxes with unknown reward distributions, observes rewards upon opening,
and decides when to stop. The utility of the learner is the maximum observed
reward minus the cumulative cost of opened boxes, and the goal is to minimize
regret defined as the gap between the cumulative expected utility and that of
the optimal policy. We propose a new algorithm that achieves
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{nT})$ regret after $T$ rounds, which improves the
$\widetilde{O}(n\sqrt{T})$ bound of Agarwal et al. [2024] and matches the known
lower bound up to logarithmic factors. To better capture real-life
applications, we then extend our results to a natural but challenging
contextual linear setting, where each box's expected reward is linear in some
known but time-varying $d$-dimensional context and the noise distribution is
fixed over time. We design an algorithm that learns both the linear function
and the noise distributions, achieving $\widetilde{O}(nd\sqrt{T})$ regret.
Finally, we show that our techniques also apply to the online Prophet
Inequality problem, where the learner must decide immediately whether or not to
accept a revealed reward. In both non-contextual and contextual settings, our
approach achieves similar improvements and regret bounds.

Result: 非共形性得分聚类方法在随机和完全未见的数据分割中表现最佳，提供了最紧密的区间和最可靠的亚组覆盖。

Conclusion: 基于聚类的CP方法可以显著改善DTI预测在不确定性下的表现。

Abstract: Accurate drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction with machine learning
models is essential for drug discovery. Such models should also provide a
credible representation of their uncertainty, but applying classical marginal
conformal prediction (CP) in DTI prediction often overlooks variability across
drug and protein subgroups. In this work, we analyze three cluster-conditioned
CP methods for DTI prediction, and compare them with marginal and
group-conditioned CP. Clusterings are obtained via nonconformity scores,
feature similarity, and nearest neighbors, respectively. Experiments on the
KIBA dataset using four data-splitting strategies show that nonconformity-based
clustering yields the tightest intervals and most reliable subgroup coverage,
especially in random and fully unseen drug-protein splits. Group-conditioned CP
works well when one entity is familiar, but residual-driven clustering provides
robust uncertainty estimates even in sparse or novel scenarios. These results
highlight the potential of cluster-based CP for improving DTI prediction under
uncertainty.

Abstract: Protein design is a fundamental challenge in biotechnology, aiming to design
novel sequences with specific functions within the vast space of possible
proteins. Recent advances in deep generative models have enabled function-based
protein design from textual descriptions, yet struggle with structural
plausibility. Inspired by classical protein design methods that leverage
natural protein structures, we explore whether incorporating fragments from
natural proteins can enhance foldability in generative models. Our empirical
results show that even random incorporation of fragments improves foldability.
Building on this insight, we introduce ProDVa, a novel protein design approach
that integrates a text encoder for functional descriptions, a protein language
model for designing proteins, and a fragment encoder to dynamically retrieve
protein fragments based on textual functional descriptions. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach effectively designs protein sequences
that are both functionally aligned and structurally plausible. Compared to
state-of-the-art models, ProDVa achieves comparable function alignment using
less than 0.04% of the training data, while designing significantly more
well-folded proteins, with the proportion of proteins having pLDDT above 70
increasing by 7.38% and those with PAE below 10 increasing by 9.6%.

Abstract: The affinity and specificity of protein-molecule binding directly impact
functional outcomes, uncovering the mechanisms underlying biological regulation
and signal transduction. Most deep-learning-based prediction approaches focus
on structures of atoms or fragments. However, quantum chemical properties, such
as electronic structures, are the key to unveiling interaction patterns but
remain largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose ECBind, a method
for tokenizing electron cloud signals into quantized embeddings, enabling their
integration into downstream tasks such as binding affinity prediction. By
incorporating electron densities, ECBind helps uncover binding modes that
cannot be fully represented by atom-level models. Specifically, to remove the
redundancy inherent in electron cloud signals, a structure-aware transformer
and hierarchical codebooks encode 3D binding sites enriched with electron
structures into tokens. These tokenized codes are then used for specific tasks
with labels. To extend its applicability to a wider range of scenarios, we
utilize knowledge distillation to develop an electron-cloud-agnostic prediction
model. Experimentally, ECBind demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across
multiple tasks, achieving improvements of 6.42\% and 15.58\% in per-structure

Conclusion: Turb-L1通过克服频谱偏差，显著提升了湍流长期预测的保真度和物理真实性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the long-term evolution of turbulence is crucial for
advancing scientific understanding and optimizing engineering applications.
However, existing deep learning methods face significant bottlenecks in
long-term autoregressive prediction, which exhibit excessive smoothing and fail
to accurately track complex fluid dynamics. Our extensive experimental and
spectral analysis of prevailing methods provides an interpretable explanation
for this shortcoming, identifying Spectral Bias as the core obstacle.
Concretely, spectral bias is the inherent tendency of models to favor
low-frequency, smooth features while overlooking critical high-frequency
details during training, thus reducing fidelity and causing physical
distortions in long-term predictions. Building on this insight, we propose
Turb-L1, an innovative turbulence prediction method, which utilizes a
Hierarchical Dynamics Synthesis mechanism within a multi-grid architecture to
explicitly overcome spectral bias. It accurately captures cross-scale
interactions and preserves the fidelity of high-frequency dynamics, enabling
reliable long-term tracking of turbulence evolution. Extensive experiments on
the 2D turbulence benchmark show that Turb-L1 demonstrates excellent
performance: (I) In long-term predictions, it reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE)
by $80.3\%$ and increases Structural Similarity (SSIM) by over $9\times$
compared to the SOTA baseline, significantly improving prediction fidelity.
(II) It effectively overcomes spectral bias, accurately reproducing the full
enstrophy spectrum and maintaining physical realism in high-wavenumber regions,
thus avoiding the spectral distortions or spurious energy accumulation seen in
other methods.

Abstract: Motivated by dynamic parameter optimization in finite, but large action

(MAB) problem in metric action spaces with oblivious Lipschitz adversaries. We
propose ABoB, a hierarchical Adversarial Bandit over Bandits algorithm that can
use state-of-the-art existing "flat" algorithms, but additionally clusters
similar configurations to exploit local structures and adapt to changing
environments. We prove that in the worst-case scenario, such clustering
approach cannot hurt too much and ABoB guarantees a standard worst-case regret
bound of $O\left(k^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$, where $T$ is the
number of rounds and $k$ is the number of arms, matching the traditional flat
approach. However, under favorable conditions related to the algorithm
properties, clusters properties, and certain Lipschitz conditions, the regret
bound can be improved to $O\left(k^{\frac{1}{4}}T^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$.
Simulations and experiments on a real storage system demonstrate that ABoB,
using standard algorithms like EXP3 and Tsallis-INF, achieves lower regret and
faster convergence than the flat method, up to 50% improvement in known
previous setups, nonstochastic and stochastic, as well as in our settings.

Distribution shift assumptions linked to the area under the curve (AUC) of a

recalibration methods. Two new methods called parametric covariate shift with
posterior drift (CSPD) and ROC-based quasi moment matching (QMM) are proposed

of the test suggest that the QMM methods discussed in the paper can provide
appropriately conservative results in evaluations with concave functionals like

model selection and hyperparameter suggestion to robust evaluation and
strategic decision-making. By fostering dynamic interactions and knowledge

more rapidly and robustly than existing single-agent or monolithic approaches.

Abstract: Network traffic prediction plays a crucial role in intelligent network
operation. Traditional prediction methods often rely on centralized training,
necessitating the transfer of vast amounts of traffic data to a central server.
This approach can lead to latency and privacy concerns. To address these
issues, federated learning integrated with differential privacy has emerged as
a solution to improve data privacy and model robustness in distributed
settings. Nonetheless, existing federated learning protocols are vulnerable to
Byzantine attacks, which may significantly compromise model robustness.
Developing a robust and privacy-preserving prediction model in the presence of
Byzantine clients remains a significant challenge. To this end, we propose an
asynchronous differential federated learning framework based on
distributionally robust optimization. The proposed framework utilizes multiple
clients to train the prediction model collaboratively with local differential
privacy. In addition, regularization techniques have been employed to further
improve the Byzantine robustness of the models. We have conducted extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets, and the results elucidate that our
proposed distributed algorithm can achieve superior performance over existing
methods.

Abstract: Future link prediction on temporal graphs is a fundamental task with wide
applicability in real-world dynamic systems. These scenarios often involve both
recurring (seen) and novel (unseen) interactions, requiring models to
generalize effectively across both types of edges. However, existing methods
typically rely on complex memory and aggregation modules, yet struggle to
handle unseen edges. In this paper, we revisit the architecture of existing
temporal graph models and identify two essential but overlooked modeling
requirements for future link prediction: representing nodes with unique
identifiers and performing target-aware matching between source and destination
nodes. To this end, we propose Cross-Attention based Future Link Predictor on
Temporal Graphs (CRAFT), a simple yet effective architecture that discards
memory and aggregation modules and instead builds on two components: learnable
node embeddings and cross-attention between the destination and the source's
recent interactions. This design provides strong expressive power and enables
target-aware modeling of the compatibility between candidate destinations and
the source's interaction patterns. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate that CRAFT consistently achieves superior performance with high
efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale real-world applications.

residual cross-attention transformer architecture, which is deployed at the
base station to further improve the CSI feedback performance. Moreover, to
tackle the "cliff-effect" of conventional bit-level CSI feedback approaches, we
integrated DJSCC into the multi-user CSI feedback, together with utilizing a
two-stage training scheme to adapt to varying uplink noise levels. Experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of our methods in CSI feedback performance,
with low network complexity and better scalability.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了单头注意力机制在理想监督下的能力与标准训练下的局限性之间的根本差距。

Abstract: We study the computational limits of learning $k$-bit Boolean functions
(specifically, $\mathrm{AND}$, $\mathrm{OR}$, and their noisy variants), using
a minimalist single-head softmax-attention mechanism, where $k=\Theta(d)$
relevant bits are selected from $d$ inputs. We show that these simple
$\mathrm{AND}$ and $\mathrm{OR}$ functions are unsolvable with a single-head
softmax-attention mechanism alone. However, with teacher forcing, the same
minimalist attention is capable of solving them. These findings offer two key
insights: Architecturally, solving these Boolean tasks requires only minimalist
attention, without deep Transformer blocks or FFNs. Methodologically, one
gradient descent update with supervision suffices and replaces the multi-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning scheme of [Kim and Suzuki, ICLR 2025] for
solving Boolean problems. Together, the bounds expose a fundamental gap between
what this minimal architecture achieves under ideal supervision and what is
provably impossible under standard training.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful
tool for modeling dynamic graph-structured data across diverse domains.
However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution
(STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve
beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an
innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning
framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating
retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The
core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores
representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural,
and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training
phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library
based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a
plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal
representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP
introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with
retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming
graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN
baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and
strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Concentration of distances in high dimension is an important factor for the
development and design of stable and reliable data analysis algorithms. In this
paper, we address the fundamental long-standing question about the
concentration of distances in high dimension for fractional quasi $p$-norms,
$p\in(0,1)$. The topic has been at the centre of various theoretical and
empirical controversies. Here we, for the first time, identify conditions when
fractional quasi $p$-norms concentrate and when they don't. We show that
contrary to some earlier suggestions, for broad classes of distributions,
fractional quasi $p$-norms admit exponential and uniform in $p$ concentration
bounds. For these distributions, the results effectively rule out previously
proposed approaches to alleviate concentration by "optimal" setting the values
of $p$ in $(0,1)$. At the same time, we specify conditions and the
corresponding families of distributions for which one can still control
concentration rates by appropriate choices of $p$. We also show that in an
arbitrarily small vicinity of a distribution from a large class of
distributions for which uniform concentration occurs, there are uncountably
many other distributions featuring anti-concentration properties. Importantly,
this behavior enables devising relevant data encoding or representation schemes
favouring or discouraging distance concentration. The results shed new light on
this long-standing problem and resolve the tension around the topic in both
theory and empirical evidence reported in the literature.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models for graph
generation, yet their use for conditional graph generation remains a
fundamental challenge. In particular, guiding diffusion models on graphs under
arbitrary reward signals is difficult: gradient-based methods, while powerful,
are often unsuitable due to the discrete and combinatorial nature of graphs,
and non-differentiable rewards further complicate gradient-based guidance. We
propose Graph Guided Diffusion (GGDiff), a novel guidance framework that
interprets conditional diffusion on graphs as a stochastic control problem to
address this challenge. GGDiff unifies multiple guidance strategies, including
gradient-based guidance (for differentiable rewards), control-based guidance
(using control signals from forward reward evaluations), and zero-order
approximations (bridging gradient-based and gradient-free optimization). This
comprehensive, plug-and-play framework enables zero-shot guidance of
pre-trained diffusion models under both differentiable and non-differentiable
reward functions, adapting well-established guidance techniques to graph
generation--a direction largely unexplored. Our formulation balances
computational efficiency, reward alignment, and sample quality, enabling
practical conditional generation across diverse reward types. We demonstrate
the efficacy of GGDiff in various tasks, including constraints on graph motifs,
fairness, and link prediction, achieving superior alignment with target rewards
while maintaining diversity and fidelity.

Abstract: Common Neighbors (CNs) and their higher-order variants are important pairwise
features widely used in state-of-the-art link prediction methods. However,
existing methods often struggle with the repetition across different orders of
CNs and fail to fully leverage their potential. We identify that these
limitations stem from two key issues: redundancy and over-smoothing in
high-order common neighbors. To address these challenges, we design
orthogonalization to eliminate redundancy between different-order CNs and
normalization to mitigate over-smoothing. By combining these two techniques, we
propose Orthogonal Common Neighbor (OCN), a novel approach that significantly
outperforms the strongest baselines by an average of 7.7% on popular link
prediction benchmarks. A thorough theoretical analysis is provided to support
our method. Ablation studies also verify the effectiveness of our
orthogonalization and normalization techniques.

Abstract: Interpretability of point cloud (PC) models becomes imperative given their
deployment in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous vehicles. We focus
on attributing PC model outputs to interpretable critical concepts, defined as
meaningful subsets of the input point cloud. To enable human-understandable
diagnostics of model failures, an ideal critical subset should be *faithful*
(preserving points that causally influence predictions) and *conceptually
coherent* (forming semantically meaningful structures that align with human
perception). We propose InfoCons, an explanation framework that applies
information-theoretic principles to decompose the point cloud into 3D concepts,
enabling the examination of their causal effect on model predictions with
learnable priors. We evaluate InfoCons on synthetic datasets for
classification, comparing it qualitatively and quantitatively with four
baselines. We further demonstrate its scalability and flexibility on two
real-world datasets and in two applications that utilize critical scores of PC.

Conclusion: PCDCNet通过物理一致性深度学习为空气质量预测提供了实用且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Air quality forecasting (AQF) is critical for public health and environmental
management, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of emissions,
meteorology, and chemical transformations. Traditional numerical models, such
as CMAQ and WRF-Chem, provide physically grounded simulations but are
computationally expensive and rely on uncertain emission inventories. Deep
learning models, while computationally efficient, often struggle with
generalization due to their lack of physical constraints. To bridge this gap,
we propose PCDCNet, a surrogate model that integrates numerical modeling
principles with deep learning. PCDCNet explicitly incorporates emissions,
meteorological influences, and domain-informed constraints to model pollutant
formation, transport, and dissipation. By combining graph-based spatial
transport modeling, recurrent structures for temporal accumulation, and
representation enhancement for local interactions, PCDCNet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 72-hour station-level PM2.5 and O3
forecasting while significantly reducing computational costs. Furthermore, our
model is deployed in an online platform, providing free, real-time air quality
forecasts, demonstrating its scalability and societal impact. By aligning deep
learning with physical consistency, PCDCNet offers a practical and
interpretable solution for AQF, enabling informed decision-making for both
personal and regulatory applications.

Abstract: This paper initiates the study of data-dependent regret bounds in constrained
MAB settings. These bounds depend on the sequence of losses that characterize
the problem instance. Thus, they can be much smaller than classical
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bounds, while being equivalent to
them in the worst case. Despite this, data-dependent regret bounds have been
completely overlooked in constrained MAB settings. The goal of this paper is to
answer the following question: Can data-dependent regret bounds be derived in
the presence of constraints? We answer this question affirmatively in
constrained MABs with adversarial losses and stochastic constraints.
Specifically, our main focus is on the most challenging and natural settings
with hard constraints, where the learner must ensure that the constraints are
always satisfied with high probability. We design an algorithm with a regret
bound consisting of two data-dependent terms. The first term captures the
difficulty of satisfying the constraints, while the second one encodes the
complexity of learning independently of the presence of constraints. We also
prove a lower bound showing that these two terms are not artifacts of our
specific approach and analysis, but rather the fundamental components that
inherently characterize the complexities of the problem. Finally, in designing
our algorithm, we also derive some novel results in the related (and easier)
soft constraints settings, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Regret minimization in stochastic non-stationary bandits gained popularity
over the last decade, as it can model a broad class of real-world problems,
from advertising to recommendation systems. Existing literature relies on
various assumptions about the reward-generating process, such as Bernoulli or
subgaussian rewards. However, in settings such as finance and
telecommunications, heavy-tailed distributions naturally arise. In this work,
we tackle the heavy-tailed piecewise-stationary bandit problem. Heavy-tailed
bandits, introduced by Bubeck et al., 2013, operate on the minimal assumption
that the finite absolute centered moments of maximum order $1+\epsilon$ are
uniformly bounded by a constant $v<+\infty$, for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We
focus on the most popular non-stationary bandit setting, i.e., the
piecewise-stationary setting, in which the mean of reward-generating
distributions may change at unknown time steps. We provide a novel Catoni-style
change-point detection strategy tailored for heavy-tailed distributions that
relies on recent advancements in the theory of sequential estimation, which is
of independent interest. We introduce Robust-CPD-UCB, which combines this
change-point detection strategy with optimistic algorithms for bandits,
providing its regret upper bound and an impossibility result on the minimum
attainable regret for any policy. Finally, we validate our approach through
numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Molecular editing aims to modify a given molecule to optimize desired
chemical properties while preserving structural similarity. However, current
approaches typically rely on string-based or continuous representations, which
fail to adequately capture the discrete, graph-structured nature of molecules,
resulting in limited structural fidelity and poor controllability. In this
paper, we propose MolEditRL, a molecular editing framework that explicitly
integrates structural constraints with precise property optimization.
Specifically, MolEditRL consists of two stages: (1) a discrete graph diffusion
model pretrained to reconstruct target molecules conditioned on source
structures and natural language instructions; (2) an editing-aware
reinforcement learning fine-tuning stage that further enhances property
alignment and structural preservation by explicitly optimizing editing
decisions under graph constraints. For comprehensive evaluation, we construct
MolEdit-Instruct, the largest and most property-rich molecular editing dataset,
comprising 3 million diverse examples spanning single- and multi-property tasks
across 10 chemical attributes. Experimental results demonstrate that MolEditRL
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both property
optimization accuracy and structural fidelity, achieving a 74\% improvement in
editing success rate while using 98\% fewer parameters.

Euclidean spaces and propose two projection-based probabilistic kernel
functions, one designed for angle comparison and the other for angle
thresholding. Unlike existing approaches that rely on random projection vectors
drawn from Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages reference angles and
employs a deterministic structure for the projection vectors. Notably, our
kernel functions do not require asymptotic assumptions, such as the number of
projection vectors tending to infinity, and can be both theoretically and
experimentally shown to outperform Gaussian-distribution-based kernel
functions. We further apply the proposed kernel function to Approximate Nearest
Neighbor Search (ANNS) and demonstrate that our approach achieves a 2.5X ~ 3X
higher query-per-second (QPS) throughput compared to the state-of-the-art
graph-based search algorithm HNSW.

Conclusion: 机器学习方法在短期电力负荷预测中具有潜力。

Abstract: Electric energy is difficult to store, requiring stricter control over its
generation, transmission, and distribution. A persistent challenge in power
systems is maintaining real-time equilibrium between electricity demand and
supply. Oversupply contributes to resource wastage, while undersupply can
strain the grid, increase operational costs, and potentially impact service
reliability. To maintain grid stability, load forecasting is needed. Accurate
load forecasting balances generation and demand by striving to predict future
electricity consumption. This thesis examines and evaluates four machine
learning frameworks for short term load forecasting, including gradient
boosting decision tree methods such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and
Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). A hybrid framework is also
developed. In addition, two recurrent neural network architectures, Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), are designed and
implemented. Pearson Correlation Coefficient is applied to assess the
relationships between electricity demand and exogenous variables. The
experimental results show that, for the specific dataset and forecasting task
in this study, machine learning-based models achieved improved forecasting
performance compared to a classical ARIMA baseline.

Abstract: Objective: To conduct a systematic assessment of machine learning
applications that utilize electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart sound data in the
development of cost-effective detection tools for rheumatic heart disease (RHD)
from the year 2015 to 2025, thereby supporting the World Heart Federation's "25

echocardiography in underserved regions. Methods: Following PRISMA-ScR
guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search across PubMed, IEEE Xplore,
Scopus, and Embase for peer-reviewed literature focusing on ML-based ECG/PCG
analysis for RHD detection. Two independent reviewers screened studies, and
data extraction focused on methodology, validation approaches, and performance
metrics. Results: Analysis of 37 relevant studies revealed that convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have become the predominant technology in post-2020
implementations, achieving a median accuracy of 93.7%. However, 73% of studies
relied on single-center datasets, only 10.8% incorporated external validation,
and none addressed cost-effectiveness. Performance varied markedly across
different valvular lesions, and despite 44% of studies originating from endemic
regions, significant gaps persisted in implementation science and demographic
diversity. Conclusion: While ML-based ECG/PCG analysis shows promise for RHD
detection, substantial methodological limitations hinder clinical translation.
Future research must prioritize standardized benchmarking frameworks,
multimodal architectures, cost-effectiveness assessments, and prospective
trials in endemic settings. Significance: This review provides a critical
roadmap for developing accessible ML-based RHD screening tools to help bridge
the diagnostic gap in resourceconstrained settings where conventional
auscultation misses up to 90% of cases and echocardiography remains
inaccessible.

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder
characterized by motor neuron degeneration, with alterations in neural
excitability serving as key indicators. Recent advancements in induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology have enabled the generation of human
iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, which, when combined with multi-electrode array
(MEA) electrophysiology, provide rich spatial and temporal electrophysiological
data. Traditionally, MEA data is analyzed using handcrafted features based on
potentially imperfect domain knowledge, which while useful may not fully
capture all useful characteristics inherent in the data. Machine learning,
particularly deep learning, has the potential to automatically learn relevant
characteristics from raw data without solely relying on handcrafted feature
extraction. However, handcrafted features remain critical for encoding domain
knowledge and improving interpretability, especially with limited or noisy
data. This study introduces FRAME-C, a knowledge-augmented machine learning
pipeline that combines domain knowledge, raw spike waveform data, and deep
learning techniques to classify MEA signals and identify ALS-specific
phenotypes. FRAME-C leverages deep learning to learn important features from
spike waveforms while incorporating handcrafted features such as spike
amplitude, inter-spike interval, and spike duration, preserving key spatial and
temporal information. We validate FRAME-C on both simulated and real MEA data
from human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, demonstrating superior performance
over existing classification methods. FRAME-C shows over 11% improvement on
real data and up to 25% on simulated data. We also show FRAME-C can evaluate
handcrafted feature importance, providing insights into ALS phenotypes.

Abstract: Generating synthetic ECG data has numerous applications in healthcare, from
educational purposes to simulating scenarios and forecasting trends. While
recent diffusion models excel at generating short ECG segments, they struggle
with longer sequences needed for many clinical applications. This paper
proposes a novel three-layer synthesis framework for generating realistic
long-form ECG signals. We first generate high-fidelity single beats using a
diffusion model, then synthesize inter-beat features preserving critical
temporal dependencies, and finally assemble beats into coherent long sequences
using feature-guided matching. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that
the resulting synthetic ECGs maintain both beat-level morphological fidelity
and clinically relevant inter-beat relationships. In arrhythmia classification
tasks, our long-form synthetic ECGs significantly outperform end-to-end
long-form ECG generation using the diffusion model, highlighting their
potential for increasing utility for downstream applications. The approach
enables generation of unprecedented multi-minute ECG sequences while preserving
essential diagnostic characteristics.

varied based on algorithms, modalities, and speech elicitation methods, with
multimodal approaches integrating acoustic, linguistic, and metadata features
demonstrating superior performance. However, limitations such as methodological

Abstract: Designing algorithms for solving high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems
directly in infinite-dimensional function spaces - where such problems are
naturally formulated - is crucial to ensure stability and convergence as the
discretization of the underlying problem is refined. In this paper, we
contribute to this line of work by analyzing a widely used sampler for linear
inverse problems: Langevin dynamics driven by score-based generative models
(SGMs) acting as priors, formulated directly in function space. Building on the
theoretical framework for SGMs in Hilbert spaces, we give a rigorous definition
of this sampler in the infinite-dimensional setting and derive, for the first
time, error estimates that explicitly depend on the approximation error of the
score. As a consequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for global convergence
in Kullback-Leibler divergence on the underlying function space. Preventing
numerical instabilities requires preconditioning of the Langevin algorithm and
we prove the existence and the form of an optimal preconditioner. The
preconditioner depends on both the score error and the forward operator and
guarantees a uniform convergence rate across all posterior modes. Our analysis
applies to both Gaussian and a general class of non-Gaussian priors. Finally,
we present examples that illustrate and validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the evolution operator for the
time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation, where the Hamiltonian may vary with
time. Existing neural network-based surrogates often ignore fundamental
properties of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, such as linearity and unitarity,
and lack theoretical guarantees on prediction error or time generalization. To
address this, we introduce a linear estimator for the evolution operator that
preserves a weak form of unitarity. We establish both upper and lower bounds on
the prediction error that hold uniformly over all sufficiently smooth initial
wave functions. Additionally, we derive time generalization bounds that
quantify how the estimator extrapolates beyond the time points seen during
training. Experiments across real-world Hamiltonians -- including hydrogen
atoms, ion traps for qubit design, and optical lattices -- show that our
estimator achieves relative errors $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-3}$ times smaller than
state-of-the-art methods such as the Fourier Neural Operator and DeepONet.

Abstract: We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra
integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants.
The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a
single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit
classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error
bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root
dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments confirm this rate and reveal
two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains
stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps
wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method
handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution.
These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional,
path-dependent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.

Abstract: Constrained stochastic nonlinear optimization problems have attracted
significant attention for their ability to model complex real-world scenarios
in physics, economics, and biology. As datasets continue to grow, online
inference methods have become crucial for enabling real-time decision-making
without the need to store historical data. In this work, we develop an online
inference procedure for constrained stochastic optimization by leveraging a
method called Sketched Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (SSQP). As a
direct generalization of sketched Newton methods, SSQP approximates the
objective with a quadratic model and the constraints with a linear model at
each step, then applies a sketching solver to inexactly solve the resulting
subproblem. Building on this design, we propose a new online inference
procedure called random scaling. In particular, we construct a test statistic
based on SSQP iterates whose limiting distribution is free of any unknown
parameters. Compared to existing online inference procedures, our approach
offers two key advantages: (i) it enables the construction of asymptotically
valid confidence intervals; and (ii) it is matrix-free, i.e. the computation
involves only primal-dual SSQP iterates $(\boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{\lambda}_t)$ without requiring any matrix inversions. We validate
our theory through numerical experiments on nonlinearly constrained regression
problems and demonstrate the superior performance of our random scaling method
over existing inference procedures.

Abstract: This paper considers a challenging problem of identifying a causal graphical
model under the presence of latent variables. While various identifiability
conditions have been proposed in the literature, they often require multiple
pure children per latent variable or restrictions on the latent causal graph.
Furthermore, it is common for all observed variables to exhibit the same
modality. Consequently, the existing identifiability conditions are often too
stringent for complex real-world data. We consider a general nonparametric
measurement model with arbitrary observed variable types and binary latent
variables, and propose a double triangular graphical condition that guarantees
identifiability of the entire causal graphical model. The proposed condition
significantly relaxes the popular pure children condition. We also establish
necessary conditions for identifiability and provide valuable insights into
fundamental limits of identifiability. Simulation studies verify that latent
structures satisfying our conditions can be accurately estimated from data.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based malware detection systems often fail to account
for the dynamic nature of real-world training and test data distributions. In
practice, these distributions evolve due to frequent changes in the Android
ecosystem, adversarial development of new malware families, and the continuous
emergence of both benign and malicious applications. Prior studies have shown
that such concept drift -- distributional shifts in benign and malicious
samples, leads to significant degradation in detection performance over time.
Despite the practical importance of this issue, existing datasets are often
outdated and limited in temporal scope, diversity of malware families, and
sample scale, making them insufficient for the systematic evaluation of concept
drift in malware detection.
  To address this gap, we present LAMDA, the largest and most temporally
diverse Android malware benchmark to date, designed specifically for concept
drift analysis. LAMDA spans 12 years (2013-2025, excluding 2015), includes over
1 million samples (approximately 37% labeled as malware), and covers 1,380
malware families and 150,000 singleton samples, reflecting the natural
distribution and evolution of real-world Android applications. We empirically
demonstrate LAMDA's utility by quantifying the performance degradation of
standard ML models over time and analyzing feature stability across years. As
the most comprehensive Android malware dataset to date, LAMDA enables in-depth
research into temporal drift, generalization, explainability, and evolving
detection challenges. The dataset and code are available at:

iNatSounds dataset. Adopting a vision-inspired approach, we convert audio
recordings to spectrograms and benchmark existing image geolocation techniques.
We hypothesize that species vocalizations offer strong geolocation cues due to
their defined geographic ranges and propose an approach that integrates species
range prediction with retrieval-based geolocation. We further evaluate whether
geolocation improves when analyzing species-rich recordings or when aggregating
across spatiotemporal neighborhoods. Finally, we introduce case studies from
movies to explore multimodal geolocation using both audio and visual content.
Our work highlights the advantages of integrating audio and visual cues, and

Abstract: We study the problem of non-stationary Lipschitz bandits, where the number of

can change arbitrarily over time. We design an algorithm that adaptively tracks
the recently introduced notion of significant shifts, defined by large
deviations of the cumulative reward function. To detect such reward changes,
our algorithm leverages a hierarchical discretization of the action space.
Without requiring any prior knowledge of the non-stationarity, our algorithm
achieves a minimax-optimal dynamic regret bound of
$\mathcal{\widetilde{O}}(\tilde{L}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, where $\tilde{L}$ is the
number of significant shifts and $T$ the horizon. This result provides the
first optimal guarantee in this setting.

method, named ALPCAHUS, that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances and
use this information to improve the estimate of the subspace bases associated
with the low-rank structure of the data. This clustering algorithm builds on
K-Subspaces (KSS) principles by extending the recently proposed heteroscedastic
PCA method, named LR-ALPCAH, for clusters with heteroscedastic noise in the UoS

accounting for data heteroscedasticity compared to existing clustering

Abstract: Model-based clustering integrated with variable selection is a powerful tool
for uncovering latent structures within complex data. However, its
effectiveness is often hindered by challenges such as identifying relevant
variables that define heterogeneous subgroups and handling data that are
missing not at random, a prevalent issue in fields like transcriptomics. While
several notable methods have been proposed to address these problems, they
typically tackle each issue in isolation, thereby limiting their flexibility
and adaptability. This paper introduces a unified framework designed to address
these challenges simultaneously. Our approach incorporates a data-driven
penalty matrix into penalized clustering to enable more flexible variable
selection, along with a mechanism that explicitly models the relationship
between missingness and latent class membership. We demonstrate that, under
certain regularity conditions, the proposed framework achieves both asymptotic
consistency and selection consistency, even in the presence of missing data.
This unified strategy significantly enhances the capability and efficiency of
model-based clustering, advancing methodologies for identifying informative
variables that define homogeneous subgroups in the presence of complex missing
data patterns. The performance of the framework, including its computational
efficiency, is evaluated through simulations and demonstrated using both
synthetic and real-world transcriptomic datasets.

Conclusion: FlashMD扩展了MD模拟的时间尺度，使其能够模拟科学和技术上重要的长时间尺度过程。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) provides insights into atomic-scale processes by
integrating over time the equations that describe the motion of atoms under the
action of interatomic forces. Machine learning models have substantially
accelerated MD by providing inexpensive predictions of the forces, but they
remain constrained to minuscule time integration steps, which are required by
the fast time scale of atomic motion. In this work, we propose FlashMD, a
method to predict the evolution of positions and momenta over strides that are
between one and two orders of magnitude longer than typical MD time steps. We
incorporate considerations on the mathematical and physical properties of
Hamiltonian dynamics in the architecture, generalize the approach to allow the
simulation of any thermodynamic ensemble, and carefully assess the possible
failure modes of such a long-stride MD approach. We validate FlashMD's accuracy
in reproducing equilibrium and time-dependent properties, using both
system-specific and general-purpose models, extending the ability of MD
simulation to reach the long time scales needed to model microscopic processes
of high scientific and technological relevance.

Abstract: Finite-difference methods are widely used for zeroth-order optimization in
settings where gradient information is unavailable or expensive to compute.
These procedures mimic first-order strategies by approximating gradients
through function evaluations along a set of random directions. From a
theoretical perspective, recent studies indicate that imposing structure (such
as orthogonality) on the chosen directions allows for the derivation of
convergence rates comparable to those achieved with unstructured random
directions (i.e., directions sampled independently from a distribution).
Empirically, although structured directions are expected to enhance
performance, they often introduce additional computational costs, which can
limit their applicability in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we
examine the impact of structured direction selection in finite-difference
methods. We review and extend several strategies for constructing structured
direction matrices and compare them with unstructured approaches in terms of
computational cost, gradient approximation quality, and convergence behavior.
Our evaluation spans both synthetic tasks and real-world applications such as
adversarial perturbation. The results demonstrate that structured directions
can be generated with computational costs comparable to unstructured ones while
significantly improving gradient estimation accuracy and optimization
performance.

Abstract: We present a weighted version of Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation for
estimating the Integrated Squared Error (ISE) when approximating an unknown
function by a predictor that depends linearly on evaluations of the function
over a finite collection of sites. The method relies on the construction of the
best linear estimator of the squared prediction error at an arbitrary unsampled
site based on squared LOO residuals, assuming that the function is a
realization of a Gaussian Process (GP). A theoretical analysis of performance
of the ISE estimator is presented, and robustness with respect to the choice of
the GP kernel is investigated first analytically, then through numerical
examples. Overall, the estimation of ISE is significantly more precise than
with classical, unweighted, LOO cross validation. Application to model
selection is briefly considered through examples.

Abstract: We study the linear stochastic bandit problem, relaxing the standard i.i.d.

assumption, we allow the noise terms across rounds to be sub-Gaussian but
interdependent, with dependencies that decay over time. To address this
setting, we develop new confidence sequences using a recently introduced
reduction scheme to sequential probability assignment, and use these to derive
a bandit algorithm based on the principle of optimism in the face of
uncertainty. We provide regret bounds for the resulting algorithm, expressed in
terms of the decay rate of the strength of dependence between observations.
Among other results, we show that our bounds recover the standard rates up to a
factor of the mixing time for geometrically mixing observation noise.

overall noise trends across various genset configurations. These findings

Conclusion: 本文为Polyak步长及其变体提供了一个简单且统一的分析视角，揭示了其收敛性和局限性。

Abstract: The Polyak stepsize has been proven to be a fundamental stepsize in convex
optimization, giving near optimal gradient descent rates across a wide range of
assumptions. The universality of the Polyak stepsize has also inspired many
stochastic variants, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical
performance. Despite the many theoretical results, our understanding of the
convergence properties and shortcomings of the Polyak stepsize or its variants
is both incomplete and fractured across different analyses. We propose a new,
unified, and simple perspective for the Polyak stepsize and its variants as
gradient descent on a surrogate loss. We show that each variant is equivalent
to minimize a surrogate function with stepsizes that adapt to a guaranteed
local curvature. Our general surrogate loss perspective is then used to provide
a unified analysis of existing variants across different assumptions. Moreover,
we show a number of negative results proving that the non-convergence results
in some of the upper bounds is indeed real.

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了Ising硬件解决多状态优化问题的潜力，在能量、性能、面积和求解质量上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Ising Machines are a prominent class of hardware architectures that aim to
solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. These machines consist of a
network of interacting binary spins/neurons that evolve to represent the
optimum ground state energy solution. Generally, combinatorial problems are
transformed into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form to
harness the computational efficiency of these Ising machines. However, this
transformation, especially for multi-state problems, often leads to a more
complex exploration landscape than the original problem, thus severely
impacting the solution quality. To address this challenge, we model the spin
interactions as a generalized boolean logic function to significantly reduce
the exploration space. We benchmark the graph coloring problem from the class
of multi-state NP-hard optimization using probabilistic Ising solvers to
illustrate the effectiveness of our framework. The proposed methodology
achieves similar accuracy compared to state-of-the-art heuristics and machine
learning algorithms, and demonstrates significant improvement over the existing
Ising methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that combining parallel tempering
with our existing framework further reduces the coloring error by up to 50%
compared to the conventionally used Gibbs sampling algorithm. We also design a
1024-neuron all-to-all connected probabilistic Ising accelerator that shows up
to 10000x performance acceleration compared to heuristics while reducing the
number of required physical neurons by 1.5-4x compared to conventional Ising
machines. Indeed, this accelerator solution demonstrates improvement across all
metrics over the current methods, i.e., energy, performance, area, and solution
quality. Thus, this work expands the potential of existing Ising hardware to
solve a broad class of these multistate optimization problems.

Abstract: Generating realistic brain connectivity matrices is key to analyzing
population heterogeneity in brain organization, understanding disease, and
augmenting data in challenging classification problems. Functional connectivity
matrices lie in constrained spaces--such as the set of symmetric positive
definite or correlation matrices--that can be modeled as Riemannian manifolds.
However, using Riemannian tools typically requires redefining core operations
(geodesics, norms, integration), making generative modeling computationally
inefficient. In this work, we propose DiffeoCFM, an approach that enables
conditional flow matching (CFM) on matrix manifolds by exploiting pullback
metrics induced by global diffeomorphisms on Euclidean spaces. We show that
Riemannian CFM with such metrics is equivalent to applying standard CFM after
data transformation. This equivalence allows efficient vector field learning,
and fast sampling with standard ODE solvers. We instantiate DiffeoCFM with two
different settings: the matrix logarithm for covariance matrices and the
normalized Cholesky decomposition for correlation matrices. We evaluate
DiffeoCFM on three large-scale fMRI datasets with more than 4600 scans from
2800 subjects (ADNI, ABIDE, OASIS-3) and two EEG motor imagery datasets with
over 30000 trials from 26 subjects (BNCI2014-002 and BNCI2015-001). It enables

innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian network that maintains separate parameter spaces
for fluid and structure domains. We study each architecture using standard Tanh
and adaptive B-spline activation functions. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity
flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that the
Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture performs significantly better. The adaptive
B-spline activation further enhances accuracy by providing locality-aware
representation near boundaries. While our methodology shows promising results
in predicting the velocity field, pressure recovery remains challenging due to
the absence of explicit force-coupling constraints in the current formulation.
Our findings underscore the importance of domain-specific architectural design
and adaptive activation functions for modeling FSI problems within the PINN

Abstract: Structural health monitoring (SHM) involves sensor deployment, data
acquisition, and data interpretation, commonly implemented via a tedious wired
system. The information processing in current practice majorly depends on
electronic computers, albeit with universal applications, delivering challenges
such as high energy consumption and low throughput due to the nature of digital
units. In recent years, there has been a renaissance interest in shifting
computations from electronic computing units to the use of real physical
systems, a concept known as physical computation. This approach provides the
possibility of thinking out of the box for SHM, seamlessly integrating sensing
and computing into a pure-physical entity, without relying on external
electronic power supplies, thereby properly coping with resource-restricted
scenarios. The latest advances of metamaterials (MM) hold great promise for
this proactive idea. In this paper, we introduce a programmable
metamaterial-based sensor (termed as MM-sensor) for physically processing
structural vibration information to perform specific SHM tasks, such as
structural damage warning (binary classification) in this initiation, without
the need for further information processing or resource-consuming, that is, the
data collection and analysis are completed in-situ at the sensor level. We
adopt the configuration of a locally resonant metamaterial plate (LRMP) to
achieve the first fabrication of the MM-sensor. We take advantage of the
bandgap properties of LRMP to physically differentiate the dynamic behavior of
structures before and after damage. By inversely designing the geometric
parameters, our current approach allows for adjustments to the bandgap
features. This is effective for engineering systems with a first natural
frequency ranging from 9.54 Hz to 81.86 Hz.

novel hybrid method that integrates numerical simulation, neural physics, and
generative control. Our neural physics jointly pursues low-latency simulation
and high physical fidelity by employing a fallback safeguard to classical
numerical solvers. Furthermore, we develop a diffusion-based controller that is
trained using a reverse modeling strategy to generate external dynamic force
fields for fluid manipulation. Our system demonstrates robust performance
across diverse 2D/3D scenarios, material types, and obstacle interactions,
achieving real-time simulations at high frame rates (11~29% latency) while
enabling fluid control guided by user-friendly freehand sketches. We present a

fluid simulations for real-time interactive applications. We promise to release

Result: 该方法显著减少了实验周期，提高了材料优化的效率。

Conclusion: 机器学习策略在电池材料优化中具有变革潜力。

Abstract: The performance of battery materials is determined by their composition and
the processing conditions employed during commercial-scale fabrication, where
raw materials undergo complex processing steps with various additives to yield
final products. As the complexity of these parameters expands with the
development of industry, conventional one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) experiment
becomes old fashioned. While domain expertise aids in parameter optimization,
this traditional approach becomes increasingly vulnerable to cognitive
limitations and anthropogenic biases as the complexity of factors grows.
Herein, we introduce an iterative machine learning (ML) framework that
integrates active learning to guide targeted experimentation and facilitate
incremental model refinement. This method systematically leverages
comprehensive experimental observations, including both successful and
unsuccessful results, effectively mitigating human-induced biases and
alleviating data scarcity. Consequently, it significantly accelerates
exploration within the high-dimensional design space. Our results demonstrate
that active-learning-driven experimentation markedly reduces the total number
of experimental cycles necessary, underscoring the transformative potential of
ML-based strategies in expediting battery material optimization.

Abstract: We propose a dim and small target detection algorithm for drone broadcast
frames based on the time-frequency analysis of communication protocol.
Specifically, by analyzing modulation parameters and frame structures, the
prior knowledge of transmission frequency, signal bandwidth, Zadoff-Chu (ZC)
sequences, and frame length of drone broadcast frames is established. The RF
signals are processed through the designed filter banks, and the frequency
domain parameters of bounding boxes generated by the detector are corrected
with transmission frequency and signal bandwidth. Given the remarkable
correlation characteristics of ZC sequences, the frequency domain parameters of
bounding boxes with low confidence scores are corrected based on ZC sequences
and frame length, which improves the detection accuracy of dim targets under
low signal-to noise ratio (SNR) situations. Besides, a segmented energy
refinement method is applied to mitigate the deviation caused by interference
signals with high energy strength, which ulteriorly corrects the time domain
detection parameters for dim targets. As the sampling duration increases, the
detection speed improves while the detection accuracy of broadcast frames
termed as small targets decreases. The trade-off between detection accuracy and
speed versus sampling duration is established, which helps to meet different
drone regulation requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm improves the average intersection over union, precision, and recall
by 3\%, 1.4\%, and 2.4\%, respectively, compared to existing algorithms. The
proposed algorithm also performs strong robustness under varying flight
distances, diverse types of environment noise, and different flight visual
environment.

Abstract: Clustering scientific publications can reveal underlying research structures
within bibliographic databases. Graph-based clustering methods, such as
spectral, Louvain, and Leiden algorithms, are frequently utilized due to their
capacity to effectively model citation networks. However, their performance may
degrade when applied to real-world data. This study evaluates the performance
of these clustering algorithms on a citation graph comprising approx. 700,000
papers and 4.6 million citations extracted from Web of Science. The results
show that while scalable methods like Louvain and Leiden perform efficiently,
their default settings often yield poor partitioning. Meaningful outcomes
require careful parameter tuning, especially for large networks with uneven
structures, including a dense core and loosely connected papers. These findings
highlight practical lessons about the challenges of large-scale data, method
selection and tuning based on specific structures of bibliometric clustering

Conclusion: LocalKMeans在分布式环境中有效，但需权衡信号噪声比与同步开销。

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the classical $K$-means alternating-minimization
algorithm, also known as Lloyd's algorithm (Lloyd, 1956), for a mixture of
Gaussians in a data-distributed setting that incorporates local iteration
steps. Assuming unlabeled data distributed across multiple machines, we propose
an algorithm, LocalKMeans, that performs Lloyd's algorithm in parallel in the
machines by running its iterations on local data, synchronizing only every $L$
of such local steps. We characterize the cost of these local iterations against
the non-distributed setting, and show that the price paid for the local steps
is a higher required signal-to-noise ratio. While local iterations were
theoretically studied in the past for gradient-based learning methods, the
analysis of unsupervised learning methods is more involved owing to the
presence of latent variables, e.g. cluster identities, than that of an
iterative gradient-based algorithm. To obtain our results, we adapt a virtual
iterate method to work with a non-convex, non-smooth objective function, in
conjunction with a tight statistical analysis of Lloyd steps.

Abstract: Ransomware remains a critical threat to cybersecurity, yet publicly available
datasets for training machine learning-based ransomware detection models are
scarce and often have limited sample size, diversity, and reproducibility. In
this paper, we introduce MLRan, a behavioural ransomware dataset, comprising
over 4,800 samples across 64 ransomware families and a balanced set of goodware
samples. The samples span from 2006 to 2024 and encompass the four major types
of ransomware: locker, crypto, ransomware-as-a-service, and modern variants. We
also propose guidelines (GUIDE-MLRan), inspired by previous work, for
constructing high-quality behavioural ransomware datasets, which informed the
curation of our dataset. We evaluated the ransomware detection performance of
several machine learning (ML) models using MLRan. For this purpose, we
performed feature selection by conducting mutual information filtering to
reduce the initial 6.4 million features to 24,162, followed by recursive
feature elimination, yielding 483 highly informative features. The ML models
achieved an accuracy, precision and recall of up to 98.7%, 98.9%, 98.5%,

malicious behaviour, including registry tampering, strings, and API misuse. The

Conclusion: 该方法为缺乏解析解的问题提供了创新的基准，并通过原始-对偶关系验证自洽性和稳定性。

Abstract: Mixed optimal stopping and stochastic control problems define variational
inequalities with non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) operators, whose
numerical solution is notoriously difficult and lack of reliable benchmarks. We
first use the dual approach to transform it into a linear operator, and then
introduce a Fractional-Boundary-Regularized Deep Galerkin Method (FBR-DGM) that
augments the classical $L^2$ loss with Sobolev-Slobodeckij norms on the
parabolic boundary, enforcing regularity and yielding consistent improvements
in the network approximation and its derivatives. The improved accuracy allows
the network to be converted back to the original solution using the dual
transform. The self-consistency and stability of the network can be tested by
checking the primal-dual relationship among optimal value, optimal wealth, and
optimal control, offering innovative benchmarks in the absence of analytical
solutions.

Conclusion: cellRCov是一种高效且稳健的协方差估计方法，适用于异常检测等实际应用。

Abstract: The sample covariance matrix is a cornerstone of multivariate statistics, but
it is highly sensitive to outliers. These can be casewise outliers, such as
cases belonging to a different population, or cellwise outliers, which are
deviating cells (entries) of the data matrix. Recently some robust covariance
estimators have been developed that can handle both types of outliers, but
their computation is only feasible up to at most 20 dimensions. To remedy this
we propose the cellRCov method, a robust covariance estimator that
simultaneously handles casewise outliers, cellwise outliers, and missing data.
It relies on a decomposition of the covariance on principal and orthogonal
subspaces, leveraging recent work on robust PCA. It also employs a ridge-type
regularization to stabilize the estimated covariance matrix. We establish some
theoretical properties of cellRCov, including its casewise and cellwise
influence functions as well as consistency and asymptotic normality. A
simulation study demonstrates the superior performance of cellRCov in
contaminated and missing data scenarios. Furthermore, its practical utility is
illustrated in a real-world application to anomaly detection. We also construct
and illustrate the cellRCCA method for robust and regularized canonical
correlation analysis.

Conclusion: 该算法在保持隐私保护的同时，显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Estimating the geometric median of a dataset is a robust counterpart to mean
estimation, and is a fundamental problem in computational geometry. Recently,
[HSU24] gave an $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differentially private algorithm
obtaining an $\alpha$-multiplicative approximation to the geometric median
objective, $\frac 1 n \sum_{i \in [n]} \|\cdot - \mathbf{x}_i\|$, given a
dataset $\mathcal{D} := \{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i \in [n]} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$.
Their algorithm requires $n \gtrsim \sqrt d \cdot \frac 1 {\alpha\varepsilon}$
samples, which they prove is information-theoretically optimal. This result is
surprising because its error scales with the \emph{effective radius} of
$\mathcal{D}$ (i.e., of a ball capturing most points), rather than the
worst-case radius. We give an improved algorithm that obtains the same
approximation quality, also using $n \gtrsim \sqrt d \cdot \frac 1
{\alpha\epsilon}$ samples, but in time $\widetilde{O}(nd + \frac d
{\alpha^2})$. Our runtime is nearly-linear, plus the cost of the cheapest
non-private first-order method due to [CLM+16]. To achieve our results, we use
subsampling and geometric aggregation tools inspired by FriendlyCore [TCK+22]
to speed up the "warm start" component of the [HSU24] algorithm, combined with
a careful custom analysis of DP-SGD's sensitivity for the geometric median
objective.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
particularly Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectroscopy, plays
a critical role in elucidating molecular structures, interactions, and
electronic properties. However, accurately interpreting 2D NMR data remains
labor-intensive and error-prone, requiring highly trained domain experts,
especially for complex molecules. Machine Learning (ML) holds significant
potential in 2D NMR analysis by learning molecular representations and
recognizing complex patterns from data. However, progress has been limited by
the lack of large-scale and high-quality annotated datasets. In this work, we
introduce 2DNMRGym, the first annotated experimental dataset designed for
ML-based molecular representation learning in 2D NMR. It includes over 22,000
HSQC spectra, along with the corresponding molecular graphs and SMILES strings.
Uniquely, 2DNMRGym adopts a surrogate supervision setup: models are trained
using algorithm-generated annotations derived from a previously validated
method and evaluated on a held-out set of human-annotated gold-standard labels.
This enables rigorous assessment of a model's ability to generalize from
imperfect supervision to expert-level interpretation. We provide benchmark
results using a series of 2D and 3D GNN and GNN transformer models,
establishing a strong foundation for future work. 2DNMRGym supports scalable
model training and introduces a chemically meaningful benchmark for evaluating
atom-level molecular representations in NMR-guided structural tasks. Our data

Conclusion: SGD框架不仅能用于异常检测和实时需求管理，还能通过设计具有特定特征的峰值曲线生成合成需求场景。

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach for decomposing urban water demand
patterns using Skewed Gaussian Distributions (SGD) to derive behavioral
insights and support operational planning. Hourly demand profiles contain
critical information for both long-term infrastructure design and daily
operations, influencing network pressures, water quality, energy consumption,
and overall reliability. By breaking down each daily demand curve into a
baseline component and distinct peak components, the proposed SGD method
characterizes each peak with interpretable parameters, including peak
amplitude, timing (mean), spread (duration), and skewness (asymmetry), thereby
reconstructing the observed pattern and uncovering latent usage dynamics. This
detailed peak-level decomposition enables both operational applications, e.g.
anomaly and leakage detection, real-time demand management, and strategic
analyses, e.g. identifying behavioral shifts, seasonal influences, or policy
impacts on consumption patterns. Unlike traditional symmetric Gaussian or
purely statistical time-series models, SGDs explicitly capture asymmetric peak
shapes such as sharp morning surges followed by gradual declines, improving the
fidelity of synthetic pattern generation and enhancing the detection of
irregular consumption behavior. The method is demonstrated on several
real-world datasets, showing that SGD outperforms symmetric Gaussian models in
reconstruction accuracy, reducing root-mean-square error by over 50% on
average, while maintaining physical interpretability. The SGD framework can
also be used to construct synthetic demand scenarios by designing daily peak
profiles with chosen characteristics. All implementation code is publicly

Abstract: Aplastic anemia is a rare, life-threatening hematologic disorder

five domains: demographics, synthetic indicators, laboratory results,
comorbidities, and medications. Over 400 variables were reduced to seven key
predictors through machine learning-based feature selection. Logistic
regression and Cox regression models were constructed to predict 7-, 14-, and
28-day mortality, and their performance was evaluated using AUROC. External
validation was conducted using the eICU Collaborative Research Database to
assess model generalizability. Among 1,662 included patients, the logistic
regression model demonstrated superior performance, with AUROC values of
0.8227, 0.8311, and 0.8298 for 7-, 14-, and 28-day mortality, respectively,
compared to the Cox model. External validation yielded AUROCs of 0.7391,
0.7119, and 0.7093. Interactive nomograms were developed based on the logistic
regression model to visually estimate individual patient risk. In conclusion,
we identified a concise set of seven predictors, led by APS III, to build
validated and generalizable nomograms that accurately estimate short-term
mortality in ICU patients with aplastic anemia. These tools may aid clinicians

methylammonium. A dataset of 1650 samples is generated by varying molar

corresponding efficiency and 50-hour degradation as targets. A fourth-degree

consistently outperforms unimodal models, achieving the highest average
accuracy in both settings: 96.207\% in the subject-dependent scenario and
8.882\% in the subject-independent scenario. However, generalization remains
limited, with classification accuracy only marginally above chance in the
subject-independent evaluations. Statistical comparisons in the
subject-dependent setting confirmed that the multimodal model significantly
outperformed the EOG and eye-tracking models. However, no statistically
significant differences were found in the subject-independent setting. Our
findings demonstrate both the potential and current limitations of eye movement
data-based refractive error estimation, contributing to the development of
continuous, non-invasive screening methods using EOG signals and eye-tracking
data.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to process the DIC measurements of
multiple biaxial stretching protocols. In particular, we develop a
optimization-based approach, which calculates the smoothed nodal displacements
using a moving least-squares algorithm subject to positive strain constraints.
As such, physically consistent displacement and strain fields are obtained.
Then, we further deploy a data-driven workflow to heterogeneous material
modeling from these physically consistent DIC measurements, by estimating a
nonlocal constitutive law together with the material microstructure. To
demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we apply it in learning a
material model and fiber orientation field from DIC measurements of a porcine
tricuspid valve anterior leaflet. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DIC
data processing approach can significantly improve the accuracy of modeling
biological materials.

Conclusion: 特征红移是膨胀率异常的敏感指标，未来数据集将进一步验证这些异常是否源于新物理或系统误差。

Abstract: In this work, we perform a model-agnostic reconstruction of the cosmic
expansion history by combining DESI-DR2 BAO and DES-SN5YR data, with a focus on
geometric determination of characteristic redshifts where notable tensions in
the expansion rate are found to emerge. Employing Gaussian process regression
alongside knot-based spline techniques, we reconstruct cosmic distances and
their derivatives to pinpoint these characteristic redshifts and infer $E(z)$.
Our analysis reveals significant deviations of approximately 4 to 5$\sigma$
from the Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM predictions, particularly pronounced in the
redshift range $z \sim 0.35-0.55$. These anomalies are consistently observed
across both reconstruction methods and combined datasets, indicating robust
late-time departures that could signal new physics beyond the standard
cosmological framework. The joint use of BAO and SN probes enhances the
precision of our constraints, allowing us to isolate these deviations without
reliance on specific cosmological assumptions. Our findings underscore the role
of characteristic redshifts as sensitive indicators of expansion rate anomalies
and motivate further scrutiny with forthcoming datasets from DESI-5YR BAO,
Euclid, and LSST. These future surveys will tighten constraints and help
distinguish whether these late-time anomalies arise from new fundamental
physics or unresolved systematics in the data.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across
vision, language, and scientific domains. Despite their empirical success,
prior theoretical analyses of the sample complexity suffer from poor scaling
with input data dimension or rely on unrealistic assumptions such as access to
exact empirical risk minimizers. In this work, we provide a principled analysis
of score estimation, establishing a sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Our approach leverages a structured
decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation,
and optimization errors, enabling us to eliminate the exponential dependence on
neural network parameters that arises in prior analyses. It is the first such
result which achieves sample complexity bounds without assuming access to the
empirical risk minimizer of score function estimation loss.

Abstract: Actor-Critic methods are widely used for their scalability, yet existing
theoretical guarantees for infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) often rely on restrictive ergodicity assumptions. We propose
NAC-B, a Natural Actor-Critic with Batching, that achieves order-optimal regret
of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ in infinite-horizon average-reward MDPs under the
unichain assumption, which permits both transient states and periodicity. This
assumption is among the weakest under which the classic policy gradient theorem
remains valid for average-reward settings. NAC-B employs function approximation
for both the actor and the critic, enabling scalability to problems with large
state and action spaces. The use of batching in our algorithm helps mitigate
potential periodicity in the MDP and reduces stochasticity in gradient
estimates, and our analysis formalizes these benefits through the introduction
of the constants $C_{\text{hit}}$ and $C_{\text{tar}}$, which characterize the
rate at which empirical averages over Markovian samples converge to the
stationary distribution.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with outcome-based feedback faces a fundamental
challenge: when rewards are only observed at trajectory endpoints, how do we
assign credit to the right actions? This paper provides the first comprehensive
analysis of this problem in online RL with general function approximation. We
develop a provably sample-efficient algorithm achieving $\widetilde{O}({C_{\rm
cov} H^3}/{\epsilon^2})$ sample complexity, where $C_{\rm cov}$ is the
coverability coefficient of the underlying MDP. By leveraging general function
approximation, our approach works effectively in large or infinite state spaces
where tabular methods fail, requiring only that value functions and reward
functions can be represented by appropriate function classes. Our results also
characterize when outcome-based feedback is statistically separated from
per-step rewards, revealing an unavoidable exponential separation for certain
MDPs. For deterministic MDPs, we show how to eliminate the completeness
assumption, dramatically simplifying the algorithm. We further extend our
approach to preference-based feedback settings, proving that equivalent
statistical efficiency can be achieved even under more limited information.
Together, these results constitute a theoretical foundation for understanding
the statistical properties of outcome-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: In this paper we derive non-asymptotic Berry-Esseen bounds for Polyak-Ruppert
averaged iterates of the Linear Stochastic Approximation (LSA) algorithm driven
by the Markovian noise. Our analysis yields $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/4})$ convergence
rates to the Gaussian limit in the Kolmogorov distance. We further establish
the non-asymptotic validity of a multiplier block bootstrap procedure for
constructing the confidence intervals, guaranteeing consistent inference under
Markovian sampling. Our work provides the first non-asymptotic guarantees on
the rate of convergence of bootstrap-based confidence intervals for stochastic
approximation with Markov noise. Moreover, we recover the classical rate of
order $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/8})$ up to logarithmic factors for estimating the
asymptotic variance of the iterates of the LSA algorithm.
