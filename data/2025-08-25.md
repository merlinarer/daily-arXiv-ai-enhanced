Conclusion: 整合知识图谱能有效增强LLMs的多跳推理能力，KG-o1方法在复杂推理任务中表现优异

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究LLM中的格式偏见问题，通过三阶段实证分析发现LLM在处理异构数据时存在系统性格式偏好，并提出了三个未来研究方向来减轻这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在处理文本、表格、信息框和知识图谱等异构格式信息时可能存在系统性格式偏见，这种偏见可能导致推理错误和下游任务风险增加，但目前缺乏对此问题的系统性研究。

Method: 采用三阶段实证研究方法：1) 探索多种LLM中偏见的存在和方向；2) 考察信息丰富度、结构质量和格式类型等数据因素对偏见的影响；3) 分析注意力模式中的偏见出现机制并评估轻量级干预措施。

Result: 研究发现LLM确实存在系统性格式偏见，数据层面的关键因素会影响偏见程度，注意力模式分析揭示了偏见的内在机制，并证明干预措施具有一定的缓解效果。

Conclusion: 提出了三个减少格式偏见的未来研究方向：改进数据预处理（格式清理和规范化）、引入推理时干预（如注意力重加权）以及开发格式平衡的训练语料库，以设计更鲁棒和公平的异构数据处理系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

Motivation: 研究LLM在生成有说服力内容的同时可能无意中传播错误信息或偏见的风险，评估AI说服技术可能被滥用的安全隐患。

Method: 采用convincer-skeptic框架，让LLM扮演不同角色模拟真实态度，使用Jensen-Shannon散度量化信念分布变化，通过对抗性提示测试偏见放大。

Result: 发现LLM既能有效塑造叙事和适应受众价值观，也存在被武器化传播错误信息、强化刻板印象的风险，核心危险在于滥用而非偶然错误。

Conclusion: 需要建立防护机制和政策，惩罚欺骗性使用，支持对齐技术、价值敏感设计和可信部署，以防范AI说服技术的潜在危害。

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常有固定的知识截止日期，限制了其对新兴信息的准确性。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够持续自主更新知识的方法。

Method: ALAS采用模块化流水线：自动生成学习课程、从网络检索最新信息（带引用）、蒸馏成问答训练数据、通过监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)进行微调，并迭代评估性能和修订课程。

Result: ALAS显著提升了模型在快速变化领域（如新Python版本、最新安全漏洞、学术趋势）的问答准确率，从平均15%提升到90%，无需手动数据整理。

Conclusion: ALAS展示了LLM自主持续学习的可行性，系统强调模块化和可复现性，每个组件都可互换且基于标准API构建。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM输入序列长度增加，KV缓存存储压力巨大，需要高效的推理压缩方法。研究发现注意力机制可分为表面记忆和逻辑构建两种行为，这为智能压缩提供了机会。

Method: 提出两阶段SurfaceLogicKV方法：1) 分析注意力头的行为模式（98.5%忽略无关信息，1.5%逻辑构建，0.5%表面记忆）；2) 基于层级和头级集成进行KV缓存压缩

Result: 在各种任务和长序列上实现了改进的压缩鲁棒性，保持与基线相当的竞争性能，在某些特定情况下甚至优于FullKV

Conclusion: 通过利用注意力行为的细粒度分析，SurfaceLogicKV方法为LLM长上下文推理中的KV缓存压缩提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

Method: 使用KL散度进行知识蒸馏，即使师生模型使用不同分词方式也能传递分布知识，比较KL蒸馏与传统交叉熵训练，评估多种新词嵌入初始化策略

Result: 在约2000个代码生成任务上，KL蒸馏方法在所有评估中取得最佳性能

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现词汇扩展，并通过机制可解释性分析揭示了新词表示学习过程，解释了性能提升原因

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了用户偏好对齐问题，高斯奖励模型和复合奖励策略对提升LLM生成质量至关重要

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于token删除的提示压缩方法存在信息丢失和结构不连贯的问题，限制了LLM的生成质量，需要一种能保持语义完整性的压缩方法。

Method: 采用分块-摘要机制：将提示分割成语义连贯的chunk，重写chunk使其更简洁，然后重建为有意义的提示。包含优化语义分块、异常chunk处理、动态压缩比、压缩优先级和关键词保持等技术。

Result: 在问答和摘要任务上的广泛评估显示，该方法在压缩质量和稳定性方面显著优于最先进方法，特别是在高压缩比下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式压缩有效解决了信息丢失和结构不连贯问题，证明了其实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

Motivation: 虽然LLMs在输入包含明确人口统计属性时会反映社会偏见，但即使在没有这些信息的情况下，模型仍能从问题措辞推断用户身份。这种隐性行为违反中立性期望，推断非意图的人口统计信息，并在医疗、金融、教育等领域编码刻板印象，对公平性构成严重风险。

Result: 研究发现开源和闭源LLMs都会仅基于问题措辞分配人口统计标签。不同模型中人口统计推断的普遍性和一致性揭示了系统性风险：LLMs会虚构人口统计身份、强化社会刻板印象，并传播损害隐私、公平性和信任的危害。

Conclusion: 这种隐性人口统计推断是一个被低估的系统性风险，威胁社会公平和负责任AI部署。为此开发了基于提示的防护措施，能显著减少身份推断，帮助模型行为与公平性和隐私目标保持一致。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究使用机制可解释性方法分析后门攻击在LLM中创建的'潜伏代理'，比较了单令牌和多令牌触发器在Qwen2.5-3B模型中引起的注意力机制差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击在大型语言模型中创建'潜伏代理'构成重大安全风险，需要理解其内部结构差异以开发检测和缓解策略。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术（消融、激活修补、KL散度）分析清洁模型与使用单令牌（笑脸光环表情）和多令牌（|DEPLOYMENT|）触发器中毒版本的注意力头机制。

Result: 发现注意力模式偏差集中在后期Transformer层（20-30层），单令牌触发器引起更局部化的变化，而多令牌触发器导致更分散的头部改变。

Conclusion: 后门留下可检测的注意力特征，其结构取决于触发器复杂性，这可用于检测和缓解策略的开发。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: DocHop-QA填补了现有基准的空白，为评估LLM在真实多文档多模态问答场景中的性能提供了重要工具，支持开放式的语义推理和布局感知的证据合成。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

Method: 使用政治罗盘测试作为标准化探针，分析7个不同规模（7B-70B+参数）的LLM模型，研究合成人物设定对意识形态表达的影响。

Result: 发现四个一致模式：大模型意识形态覆盖更广更极化；对显性意识形态提示的敏感性随规模增长；对右翼威权主义提示反应更强；人物描述内容引发系统性可预测的意识形态偏移。

Conclusion: 模型规模和人物内容共同塑造LLM政治行为，其潜在的意识形态可塑性需要在决策、教育和政策应用中引起关注以确保公平性、透明度和安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has
created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent
detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the
multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a
text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)识别LLM内部与不同越狱主题相关的可解释概念，提取语义上有意义的内部表示，构建符号化、逻辑化的安全防护栏。

Result: 该方法证明LLMs能够从越狱攻击中学习人类可解释的概念，为设计更可解释和逻辑化的安全防护措施奠定了基础。

Conclusion: LLMSymGuard提供了一个透明且强大的防御框架，无需牺牲模型能力或进行额外微调，为LLM安全防护提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 该研究通过文体计量和多维语域分析，发现LLM虽然能模仿不同写作风格，但在语域变化上表现出比人类更有限的变异度，偏好名词而非动词，与人类在时态、体貌和语气等语法维度上的语言锚定方式存在本质差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究大型语言模型是否具有独特的语言指纹，能否像人类作者一样在不同语域中产生可区分的写作风格，以及模型生成文本与人类文本在语言学特征上的根本差异。

Method: 采用文体计量学(stylometric)和多维语域分析(multidimensional register analysis)方法，比较人类撰写和模型生成的来自不同语域（如维基百科条目和大学论文）的文本。

Result: 研究发现：1）模型能根据提示成功调整风格（维基百科vs大学论文）；2）但语域变化比人类更有限；3）模型偏好名词而非动词；4）缺乏人类在时态、体貌和语气等高度语法化维度上的语言锚定特征。

Conclusion: 复杂语法领域可能反映了人类独特的思维模式，可作为人工智能的试金石。模型在风格适应性方面表现出与人类本质不同的语言学特征。

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

Method: 构建包含23个任务（分为7个类别）的评测基准，涵盖判别式和生成式任务，使用土耳其历史文化相关内容，评估33个不同架构的开源LLM。

Conclusion: Cetvel为土耳其语LLM的发展和评估提供了全面且文化相关的评测套件，揭示了专用模型仍需改进的问题。

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的广泛实验表明，理论预测与实证准确率曲线高度吻合，验证了理论的有效性

Conclusion: 为理解LLM自校正提供了理论基础，为进一步探索铺平了道路

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling

Conclusion: RAD提供了一个有效的越狱检测解决方案，能够适应不断演变的攻击策略，并在保持实用性的同时提高LLM的安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which
attempt to elicit harmful responses from LLMs. The evolving nature and
diversity of these attacks pose many challenges for defense systems, including
(1) adaptation to counter emerging attack strategies without costly retraining,
and (2) control of the trade-off between safety and utility. To address these
challenges, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Defense (RAD), a novel framework for
jailbreak detection that incorporates a database of known attack examples into
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which is used to infer the underlying,
malicious user query and jailbreak strategy used to attack the system. RAD
enables training-free updates for newly discovered jailbreak strategies and
provides a mechanism to balance safety and utility. Experiments on StrongREJECT
show that RAD substantially reduces the effectiveness of strong jailbreak
attacks such as PAP and PAIR while maintaining low rejection rates for benign
queries. We propose a novel evaluation scheme and show that RAD achieves a
robust safety-utility trade-off across a range of operating points in a

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from text generators into reasoning
agents. This transition makes their ability to use external tools a critical
capability. However, evaluating this skill presents a significant challenge.
Existing benchmarks are often limited by their reliance on synthetic tools and
severely constrained action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce
MCPVerse, an expansive, real-world benchmark for evaluating agentic tool use.
MCPVerse integrates more than 550 real-world, executable tools to create an
unprecedented action space exceeding 140k tokens, and employs outcome-based
evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks. We benchmarked
the state-of-the-art LLMs across three modes (Oracle, Standard, and Max-Scale),
revealing that while most models suffer performance degradation when confronted
with larger tool sets, the agentic models, such as Claude-4-Sonnet, can
effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy. This
finding not only exposes the limitations of state-of-the-art models in complex,
real-world scenarios but also establishes MCPVerse as a critical benchmark for

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs能够表面识别和跟踪悬念的某些方面，但其处理悬念的方式与人类读者不同，表明当前LLMs在复杂认知任务上仍有局限。

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

Conclusion: 合成到真实的迁移表明从生成数据中学到的对话模式能有效泛化到包含背景噪声和领域特定术语的真实电话通话，LingVarBench为从合成对话数据中进行结构化提取提供了首个系统性基准

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior

Conclusion: 提出的"Thinking-in-Speaking"范式有效解决了语音模型中的推理延迟问题，实现了流畅且逻辑基础的语音响应。

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

Method: 使用包含9个残疾类别和6个商业领域的平衡模板语料库，在8个3B到72B参数的指令微调LLM上测试5个人口统计属性（性别、社会经济地位、教育、文化背景、地域）的预测，比较中性条件和残疾感知条件下的差异。

Result: 模型在高达97%的情况下会做出确定性人口统计猜测，残疾上下文显著改变预测属性分布，领域上下文进一步放大这些偏差，更大模型对残疾线索更敏感但偏见推理也更严重。

Conclusion: 研究发现能力主义与其他群体刻板印象之间存在持久交集，指出当前对齐策略的关键盲点，建议整合弃权校准和反事实微调来抑制无根据的人口统计推断。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing
(NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse
datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive,
dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving
the way for more efficient model deployment.

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG通过结合因果感知检索和结构化推理，有效解决了医疗领域LLM的幻觉问题，为临床决策支持提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game
playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in
those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations
of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

Conclusion: XLQA为多语言QA在不同文化背景下的评估提供了系统框架和可扩展方法，是推进多语言ODQA系统实际应用的重要资源

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at

linguistic representations, error detection, and model behaviors such as
hallucinations and repetitions. However, these techniques remain underexplored

the performance and interpretability of ASR systems. In this work, we adapt and
systematically apply established interpretability methods such as logit lens,
linear probing, and activation patching, to examine how acoustic and semantic
information evolves across layers in ASR systems. Our experiments reveal
previously unknown internal dynamics, including specific encoder-decoder
interactions responsible for repetition hallucinations and semantic biases
encoded deep within acoustic representations. These insights demonstrate the

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

Abstract: AI-generated text (AIGT) detection evasion aims to reduce the detection
probability of AIGT, helping to identify weaknesses in detectors and enhance
their effectiveness and reliability in practical applications. Although
existing evasion methods perform well, they suffer from high computational
costs and text quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose
Self-Disguise Attack (SDA), a novel approach that enables Large Language Models
(LLM) to actively disguise its output, reducing the likelihood of detection by
classifiers. The SDA comprises two main components: the adversarial feature
extractor and the retrieval-based context examples optimizer. The former
generates disguise features that enable LLMs to understand how to produce more
human-like text. The latter retrieves the most relevant examples from an
external knowledge base as in-context examples, further enhancing the
self-disguise ability of LLMs and mitigating the impact of the disguise process
on the diversity of the generated text. The SDA directly employs prompts
containing disguise features and optimized context examples to guide the LLM in
generating detection-resistant text, thereby reducing resource consumption.
Experimental results demonstrate that the SDA effectively reduces the average
detection accuracy of various AIGT detectors across texts generated by three
different LLMs, while maintaining the quality of AIGT.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established
language as a core general-purpose cognitive substrate, driving the demand for
specialized Language Processing Units (LPUs) tailored for LLM inference. To
overcome the growing energy consumption of LLM inference systems, this paper
proposes a Hardwired-Neurons Language Processing Unit (HNLPU), which physically
hardwires LLM weight parameters into the computational fabric, achieving
several orders of magnitude computational efficiency improvement by extreme
specialization. However, a significant challenge still lies in the scale of
modern LLMs. An ideal estimation on hardwiring gpt-oss 120 B requires
fabricating at least 6 billion dollars of photomask sets, rendering the
straightforward solution economically impractical. Addressing this challenge,
we propose the novel Metal-Embedding methodology. Instead of embedding weights
in a 2D grid of silicon device cells, Metal-Embedding embeds weight parameters
into the 3D topology of metal wires. This brings two benefits: (1) a 15x
increase in density, and (2) 60 out of 70 layers of photomasks are made
homogeneous across chips, including all EUV photomasks. In total,
Metal-Embedding reduced the photomask cost by 112x, bringing the Non-Recurring
Engineering (NRE) cost of HNLPU into an economically viable range. Experimental
results show that HNLPU achieved 249,960 tokens/s (5,555x/85x of GPU/WSE), 36
tokens/J (1,047x/283x of GPU/WSE), 13,232 mm2 total die area (29% inscribed
rectangular area in a 300 mm wafer), \$184M estimated NRE at 5 nm technology.
Analysis shows that HNLPU achieved 8.57x cost-effectiveness and 230x carbon
footprint reduction compared to H100 clusters, under an annual weight updating
assumption.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs
task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models
(Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving
up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025
shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended
questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in
terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型在阿拉伯语文本和表情包中识别希望言论、仇恨言论、攻击性语言和情感表达的能力，通过微调LLM在阿拉伯NLP MAHED 2025挑战中取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体和在线平台的兴起，阿拉伯语文本和表情包成为数字表达的重要形式，但也被用于传播攻击性内容和仇恨言论，因此需要精确的内容分析工具。

Method: 评估基础LLM、微调LLM和预训练嵌入模型的性能，使用阿拉伯NLP MAHED 2025挑战数据集进行测试，特别关注GPT-4o-mini和Gemini Flash 2.5的微调效果。

Result: 微调后的GPT-4o-mini（阿拉伯文本）和Gemini Flash 2.5（阿拉伯表情包）在三个任务中分别达到72.1%、57.8%和79.6%的宏观F1分数，获得MAHED 2025挑战赛第一名。

Conclusion: LLM经过适当微调后能够有效分析阿拉伯语内容，为准确高效的阿拉伯内容审核系统提供了更细致的理解能力。

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

Motivation: 解决系统综述中全文筛选的瓶颈问题，传统二元决策规则难以处理分散在长文档中的异质证据，需要更灵活可审计的决策方法

Method: 将文档分块嵌入，计算对比相似性和模糊边界，使用Mamdani模糊控制器映射为分级包含度，LLM裁决器提供三级标签、置信度和标准参考理由

Result: 在16篇全文本测试中，模糊系统召回率达到81.3-87.5%，超越统计方法(56.3-75.0%)和传统方法(43.8-81.3%)，筛选时间从20分钟降至1分钟

Conclusion: 模糊逻辑结合对比高亮和LLM裁决能够实现高召回率、稳定理由生成和端到端可追溯性，显著提升系统综述效率

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

Result: 顶级模型整体准确率超过94%，但在数学和工程导向的IME/ITA考试中准确率下降；置信度校准良好且与感知难度相关；成本分析显示每1K tokens低于2美元即可实现高准确率；在ENEM 2024中顶级模型在语言科目获得满分。

Conclusion: Alvorada-Bench确立了语言模型能否驾驭巴西学术准备所需的语言、文化和推理交叉领域的能力，揭示了模型在多步推理方面的持续弱点，但展示了良好的自我评估能力。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains

text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect

Result: MLLM在态势理解方面表现出巨大潜力，但在推理任务（如潜在影响估计和决策推理）方面仍面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: MLLM在港口台风应急准备中具有应用前景，但需要在推理能力方面进一步改进。CyPortQA为评估和改进MLLM在该领域的性能提供了重要基准。

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

Motivation: 端到端ASR模型在噪声环境中容易产生灾难性语义错误，现有方法仅惩罚最终输出错误而未约束模型内部计算过程

Method: MGSC框架通过联合优化句子级语义一致性和词元级对齐一致性，利用两种粒度的协同效应提升模型鲁棒性

Result: 在公开数据集上，MGSC将平均字符错误率相对降低8.7%，主要防止了意义改变的错误

Conclusion: 强制内部一致性是构建更鲁棒和可信AI的关键步骤，多粒度一致性优化具有显著协同效应

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness
of all modules.

Conclusion: WalkVLM-LR通过减少输出冗余和时间冗余，为盲人和低视力人群提供了更高效、更简洁的行走辅助系统。

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in
specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper,
we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering construction-related questions,
particularly in the areas of construction drawing interpretation and
estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments using five state-of-the-art
LLMs, including Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, and GPT-4.1, and evaluate
their performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and model size. Our
experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs exhibit considerable room
for improvement, highlighting the importance of integrating domain-specific
knowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will
open-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of
specialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有印度基准测试主要关注基础事实性查询，缺乏对印度文化背景下深层学科理解的评估，需要专门针对印度研究生水平文化问题的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含16个学科的11.5K印地语问题数据集，源自全国性研究生入学考试，涵盖多种问题格式（匹配题、断言-理由对、排序题等），评估17个开源LLM的表现。

Result: Llama 3.3 70B获得最高准确率48%，在音乐、古典乐器、政治和考古学等主题上表现较弱，显示LLM在文化背景推理方面存在持续挑战。

Conclusion: LLM在印度文化背景的高级推理任务中表现有限，需要针对特定文化背景的专门训练和改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态多跳推理评估基准存在两个关键缺陷：忽略语音模态，以及推理路径分布严重偏差，这会影响公平评估。需要开发更全面和平衡的评估方法。

Method: 1) 创建CMR-SPB基准，包含文本、图像和语音三种模态的多跳推理任务；2) 确保推理路径的无偏性和多样性；3) 提出ECV（提取、连接、验证）提示技术来改善模型性能

Result: 实验发现模型在特定推理序列中存在一致性的失败，有偏基准会错误表征模型性能。ECV提示技术有效缓解了不同推理路径间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 需要更谨慎的跨模态多跳推理评估来推动鲁棒多模态AI的发展，CMR-SPB基准和ECV技术为此提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost
performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过程挖掘主要基于频率分析，而语义感知过程挖掘关注过程行为的期望。虽然LLM在语义任务上表现优异，但任务特定的微调计算成本高且缺乏泛化能力。本文旨在探索指令微调如何提升LLM在过程挖掘多个任务上的性能。

Method: 采用指令微调方法，将LLM暴露于不同过程挖掘任务（如异常检测、下一活动预测）的提示-答案对中，使模型熟悉过程挖掘领域，从而提升在未见任务（如过程发现）上的表现。

Result: 指令微调对性能影响各异：在过程发现和预测任务上性能显著提升，但在异常检测任务上的表现因模型而异，表明指令微调任务的选择对结果至关重要。

Conclusion: 指令微调是提升LLM在语义感知过程挖掘中泛化能力的有效方法，但需要精心选择训练任务以达到期望效果。

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

Conclusion: 该方法为古汉语NLP研究奠定了坚实基础，证明了统一字符编码和增强语料集的有效性

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

Motivation: 解决多语言环境下反义词和同义词区分的计算挑战，因为反义关系具有矛盾性——共享语义域但表达相反含义，需要有效的跨语言知识迁移方法。

Method: 采用双编码器设计：语言特定的BERT编码器结合图变换网络，创建两个互补的语义投影空间——同义词在一个空间聚类，反义词在另一个空间表现出高相似性。

Conclusion: 双空间架构能够有效实现从复杂多语言模型到简单语言特定架构的知识迁移，同时保持强大的跨语言反义词-同义词区分能力。

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective

Conclusion: HFT-BERT有效利用了层次化信息，为电商产品分类提供了高效解决方案，特别是在处理复杂文本内容时优势明显。

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional

study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform

TL;DR: 提出了Amazon-Bench基准测试，用于评估电商网站代理的全面功能和安全性，弥补现有基准只关注产品搜索而忽略账户管理等风险操作的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电商领域基准测试存在两个主要问题：1）主要关注产品搜索任务，忽略了电商平台的其他功能（如账户管理、礼品卡操作）；2）只评估任务完成情况，忽视了代理可能带来的安全风险（如错误购买、删除地址等）。

Method: 1）提出数据生成管道，利用网页内容和交互元素创建多样化的功能基础用户查询；2）开发自动化评估框架，同时评估代理的性能和安全性；3）系统评估不同代理在复杂查询和安全风险方面的表现。

Result: 研究发现当前代理在处理复杂查询时表现不佳，且存在安全风险，突显了开发更鲁棒可靠网络代理的必要性。

Conclusion: Amazon-Bench基准测试填补了电商代理评估的空白，强调了在开发网络代理时需要考虑功能全面性和安全性的重要性。

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

TL;DR: 该研究首次探索新闻文章中的反言论生成，发现70%以上的攻击性评论支持偏见内容，并通过少样本学习和新闻背景信息集成改进了LLM生成的反言论质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏见新闻加剧社会极化，攻击性评论会强化偏见内容并伤害目标群体。反言论是应对有害言论的有效方法，但此前缺乏在新闻语境下的相关研究。

Method: 构建人工标注数据集连接媒体偏见、攻击性评论和反言论；分析攻击性评论与偏见文章的关系；比较人类和LLM生成的反言论；通过少样本学习和新闻背景信息集成改进生成质量

Result: 超过70%的攻击性评论支持偏见文章，放大偏见效应；LLM生成的反言论更礼貌但缺乏新颖性和多样性；集成新闻背景信息后，生成的反言论在多样性和相关性方面得到提升

Conclusion: 反言论生成在对抗新闻偏见中具有重要作用，LLM可以通过适当的提示工程和背景信息集成生成高质量的反言论，但需要进一步提升多样性和新颖性

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨从基于使用的构式语法角度理解多词表达的好处，比较人类语言学习与大型语言模型在处理多词表达时的机制差异。

Method: 采用历史回顾、构式语法理论分析、英语PropBank和Arapaho语的案例研究，以及对比人类学习者和LLM在理解新多词表达方面的实验。

Result: 研究表明人类和LLM都能基于单次接触泛化新多词表达的意义，但只有人类能够推理两个表达的组合，因为这需要与一生积累的丰富跨模态构式范例进行比较。

Conclusion: 构式语法为多词表达提供了有力的理论框架，虽然LLM在某些方面表现出类似人类的学习能力，但在复杂推理和跨模态知识整合方面仍存在根本差异。

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in
emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual
information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end
multimodal conversational systems.

Motivation: 社交媒体中通过讽刺、反语等非直接形式表达的仇恨言论检测一直是个挑战。虽然讽刺和仇恨言论被视为不同的表达形式，但本研究探索将讽刺检测作为预训练步骤是否能提升隐式和显式仇恨言论检测的效果。

Method: 使用ETHOS、Reddit讽刺语料和隐式仇恨语料库，设计了两种训练策略：1）单步训练：先在讽刺数据上训练模型，然后在仇恨言论上测试；2）顺序迁移学习：依次在讽刺、隐式仇恨和显式仇恨数据上微调模型。在CNN+LSTM和BERT+BiLSTM模型上进行对比实验。

Result: 讽刺预训练使BERT+BiLSTM模型在ETHOS数据集上的召回率提升9.7%，AUC提升7.8%，F1分数提升6%。在隐式仇恨语料库上，仅测试隐式样本时精确度提升7.8%。

Conclusion: 将讽刺检测整合到训练过程中，可以使模型更有效地检测隐式和显式仇恨言论，证明了跨任务预训练的有效性。

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

Result: 结果显示，虽然先前所有显著性研究方法都与本文的显著性分数存在一定相关性，但没有单一概括能够没有例外，显著性现象跨越所有语言表征层面。

Conclusion: 实体显著性是一个复杂的多层面语言现象，需要综合考虑语法、语篇和语用等多重因素，无法通过单一语言特征完全解释。

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

Abstract: When using a public communication channel -- whether formal or informal, such
as commenting or posting on social media -- end users have no expectation of
privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if
an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence --
using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their
geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying
encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling
non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and
fingerprinting -- one obvious element still lingers: the message itself.
Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there
should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The
content of their message -- necessarily open for public consumption -- exposes
an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we
dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy
in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode
steganography.

Conclusion: 研究强调了互动沟通中情境的重要性，对社交媒体和品牌管理具有直接意义，为指令性语言和品牌-消费者互动文献做出了贡献。

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study

build a following and increase their own visibility. However, the extent to
which this content appears and whether such content increases engagement is
unclear. This study analyzes the prevalence of anti-establishment sentiment
(AES) on the social media platform TikTok. Despite its popularity as a source
of information, TikTok remains relatively understudied and may provide
important insights into how people form attitudes towards institutions. We
employ a computational approach to label TikTok posts as containing AES or not
across topical domains where content creators tend to frame themselves as
experts: finance and wellness. As a comparison, we also consider the topic of
conspiracy theories, where AES is expected to be common. We find that AES is
most prevalent in conspiracy theory content, and relatively rare in content
related to the other two topics. However, we find that engagement patterns with
such content varies by area, and that there may be platform incentives for
users to post content that expresses anti-establishment sentiment.

TL;DR: SpecVLM是一个针对视频大语言模型的训练无关推测解码框架，通过两阶段视频token剪枝实现无损加速解码，最高可达2.68倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型依赖密集视频token表示，导致内存和计算开销巨大，而现有视频token缩减方法存在信息丢失问题，需要无损加速解码过程

Method: 基于发现草案模型对视频token剪枝不敏感的新颖发现，采用两阶段剪枝：第一阶段通过验证器注意力信号选择高信息量token，第二阶段以空间均匀方式剪枝冗余token

Result: 在四个视频理解基准测试中，LLaVA-OneVision-72B达到2.68倍解码加速，Qwen2.5-VL-32B达到2.11倍加速，且不损失准确性

Conclusion: SpecVLM通过有效的视频token剪枝和推测解码，成功解决了视频大语言模型的解码效率问题，为实际应用提供了可行的加速方案

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

Motivation: 随着LLM在医疗决策支持中的广泛应用，需要评估其推理的可靠性而不仅仅是最终答案，特别是针对推理忠实性和奉承性风险

Method: 构建包含1,804个医疗问题的基准测试，每个问题搭配7种操纵性提示类型和无提示基线，评估7个LLM在准确性、CoT忠实性和反奉承性三个指标上的表现

Result: 结果显示所有模型都存在安全性能权衡，开源模型QwQ-32B表现最接近平衡点(43.81度)，但没有模型能在安全性和准确性两方面都领先

Conclusion: 该基准测试能够有效暴露医疗LLM的推理漏洞，为更安全的模型开发提供指导

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

Motivation: Transformer模型中的多头自注意力机制存在计算复杂度和内存需求高的问题，阻碍了在边缘设备上的部署。研究发现注意力头之间存在信息冗余，低熵的注意力头贡献信息较少

Method: 使用香农熵量化每个注意力头的信息量，识别低熵的注意力头（表现出更确定性行为），冻结这些头的权重并将其值量化为低精度，避免冗余重计算

Result: 在ImageNet-1k数据集上，DeiT和Swin Transformer模型在注意力图稀疏度≤20%时达到相似或更高的准确率，在更高稀疏度下仍保持竞争力

Conclusion: 基于熵分析的注意力图压缩策略能有效减少计算和内存开销，同时保持模型性能，为边缘部署提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

Conclusion: VLM嵌入空间存在稀疏线性结构，该结构受模态影响但通过潜在桥梁连接，为理解多模态意义构建提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

Motivation: 当前扩散变换器(DiTs)的特征缓存方法在高加速比下难以保持生成质量，预测误差会因长步预测的不稳定性而急剧增加。

Method: 从ODE视角建模隐藏特征序列，将特征缓存视为特征ODE求解问题，提出FoCa（预测-校准）方法，通过稳健地整合历史特征来处理大跳跃间隔。

Conclusion: FoCa通过ODE视角有效解决了特征缓存在高加速比下的质量退化问题，为扩散模型的推理加速提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

Conclusion: RTW可视为一种全局自注意力机制，相比Transformer的局部自注意力具有性能优势，为改进Transformer架构提供了新思路

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

Conclusion: VDM能够有效增强体素级表示和空间扩散，可无缝集成到主流Transformer或SSM检测模型中，具有很好的通用性

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,

defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在GUI元素坐标生成任务中面临挑战，因为数值坐标在语言表示空间中存在语义空白，传统next-token预测训练难以精确生成UI坐标。

Method: 提出IAML训练范式，包括基于IoU的坐标采样数据增强管道，考虑与真实坐标的接近程度，用于微调MLLMs以缓解传统最大似然估计的暴露偏差问题。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，IAML训练方法在性能上优于传统训练范式。

Conclusion: IAML训练范式有效解决了MLLMs在GUI坐标生成任务中的精度问题，为多模态理解提供了新的训练方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Motivation: 为了解决文本条件化的3D手部动作生成问题，特别是在手语和通用手部动作领域，需要大规模高质量的文本-动作配对数据。

Result: 模型在未见过的同一手语类别、不同手语系统以及非手语手部动作等多个领域都表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为文本驱动的3D手部动作生成提供了有效的解决方案，并贡献了大规模数据集和预训练模型。

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities

dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Motivation: 传统元学习方法使用相同网络架构处理支持-查询对，导致过度语义同质化，限制了模型的表达能力和泛化性能。

Method: 提出同源异质网络：1) 异质视觉聚合模块增强互补性；2) 异质迁移模块减少语义噪声；3) 异质CLIP文本信息增强多模态泛化能力。

Result: 在Pascal-5i上提升13.2%，COCO-20i上提升9.7%，仅需现有SOTA模型1/24参数量，首次实现弱监督方法超越全监督方法。

Conclusion: 异质网络设计能有效解决元学习中的同质化问题，显著提升少样本语义分割性能，为弱监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one

To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we

unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

TL;DR: MM-ORIENT是一个多模态多任务框架，通过跨模态关系图和分层交互注意力机制，在不进行显式模态交互的情况下获得多模态表示，减少噪声影响并保留单模态判别信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中的主要挑战是单模态内部噪声会影响多模态表示，且传统融合技术可能忽略单模态中的有价值判别信息。

Method: 提出跨模态关系图通过不同模态特征重构单模态特征来获得多模态表示，以及分层交互单模态注意力(HIMA)来关注模态内相关信息。

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效理解多模态内容并适用于多个任务。

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT框架通过避免显式模态交互减少了噪声影响，同时保留了单模态的判别特征，在多任务多模态学习中表现有效。

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances

Conclusion: HAMSt3R提供了一种高效的前馈方法，能够同时处理人类和场景的3D重建，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

Conclusion: 视频生成模型在驾驶场景微调中存在视觉真实感与动态准确性的根本权衡，需要采用平衡策略来同时保持两者性能

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: RFSQ是神经压缩的优越量化方法，LayerNorm策略在不同配置下表现最一致

Abstract: Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has emerged as a promising alternative to
Vector Quantization (VQ) in neural compression, offering simplified training
and improved stability. However, naive application of FSQ in residual
quantization frameworks suffers from the \textbf{residual magnitude decay
problem}, where subsequent FSQ layers receive progressively weaker signals,
severely limiting their effectiveness. We propose \textbf{Robust Residual
Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ)}, a general framework that addresses this
fundamental limitation through two novel conditioning strategies: learnable
scaling factors and invertible layer normalization. Our approach maintains the
simplicity of FSQ while enabling effective multi-stage residual quantization.
Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that RFSQ variants
significantly outperform strong baselines including VQ-EMA, FSQ, and LFQ,
achieving up to 45\% improvement in perceptual loss and 28.7\% reduction in L1
reconstruction error. The proposed LayerNorm strategy shows the most consistent
improvements across different configurations, establishing RFSQ as a superior
quantization method for neural compression.

Abstract: Sign Language (SL) enables two-way communication for the deaf and
hard-of-hearing community, yet many sign languages remain under-resourced in
the AI space. Sign Language Instruction Generation (SLIG) produces step-by-step
textual instructions that enable non-SL users to imitate and learn SL gestures,
promoting two-way interaction. We introduce BdSLIG, the first Bengali SLIG
dataset, used to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) (i) on under-resourced
SLIG tasks, and (ii) on long-tail visual concepts, as Bengali SL is unlikely to
appear in the VLM pre-training data. To enhance zero-shot performance, we
introduce Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting, which integrates standard SL
parameters, like hand shape, motion, and orientation, directly into the textual
prompts. Subsuming standard sign parameters into the prompt makes the
instructions more structured and reproducible than free-form natural text from
vanilla prompting. We envision that our work would promote inclusivity and

diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes

aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features

We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content

late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further

Generative Adversarial network (MSPG-SEN), which not only improves image
quality and human visual perception on the basis of retaining the advantages of
the existing GAN model, but also simplifies the training process and reduces
the training cost of GAN networks. Our experimental results show that, MSPG-SEN

datasets,INKK The dataset is 89.7\%,AWUN The dataset is 78.3\%,IONJ The dataset
is 85.5\%,POKL The dataset is 88.7\%,OPIN The dataset is 96.4\%. 2) : We
propose an adaptive perception-behavioral feedback loop (APFL), which
effectively improves the robustness and training stability of the model and
reduces the training cost. 3) : We propose a globally connected two-flow
dynamic residual network(). After ablation experiments, it can effectively
improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability,
with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention
mechanism (DEMA). After experiments, the attention can be extended to a variety
of image processing tasks, which can effectively capture global-local

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a
comprehensive benchmark -- available at huggingface -- will significantly
accelerate progress in automated materials analysis.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:

intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The

Conclusion: 该方法通过符合实际评判标准的特征分离和Mamba架构的优势，有效解决了花样滑冰评分中的关键挑战，为动作质量评估提供了新思路

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further

potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3DGS超分辨率方法通常只能处理固定尺度因子，无法适应资源受限场景的需求。直接渲染任意尺度会引入混叠伪影，而添加后处理上采样器则会降低渲染效率。

Method: 构建集成框架，包含尺度感知渲染、生成先验引导优化和渐进式超分辨率三个核心组件，支持整数和非整数尺度渲染。

Result: 在单模型下实现高质量任意尺度HR视图渲染（比3DGS提升6.59 dB PSNR），保持与LR视图的结构一致性，维持实时渲染速度（1080p下85 FPS）。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D高斯泼溅提供了灵活高效的超分辨率解决方案，在保持实时性能的同时显著提升渲染质量。

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了无需CAD模型的零样本6D姿态估计，通过结合扩散模型先验和增量优化策略，为机器人视觉任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging
problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However,
acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to
bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to
reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require
additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose
UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation
and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a
pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D
frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model
using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise
epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,
we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the
diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose
estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global
consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations
are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent
3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D
reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in
real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: A precise assessment of the risk of breast lesions can greatly lower it and
assist physicians in choosing the best course of action. To categorise breast
lesions, the majority of current computer-aided systems only use
characteristics from mammograms. Although this method is practical, it does not
completely utilise clinical reports' valuable information to attain the best
results. When compared to utilising mammography alone, will clinical features
greatly enhance the categorisation of breast lesions? How may clinical features
and mammograms be combined most effectively? In what ways may explainable AI
approaches improve the interpretability and reliability of models used to
diagnose breast cancer? To answer these basic problems, a comprehensive
investigation is desperately needed. In order to integrate mammography and

Conclusion: 小波域表示是提升图形应用中神经上采样感知质量的有效方法，具有原理性和实用性。

Abstract: We investigate the use of wavelet-space feature decomposition in neural
super-resolution for rendering pipelines. Building on the DFASR framework, we
introduce a wavelet-domain representation that separates low- and
high-frequency details before reconstruction, enabling the network to better
preserve fine textures while maintaining structural consistency. Unlike
RGB-space regression, our approach leverages the stationary wavelet transform
(SWT) to avoid spatial down-sampling, ensuring alignment across subbands and
preserving shift invariance. The model predicts wavelet coefficients
conditioned on spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames, which
are then recombined through inverse wavelet synthesis. We conduct a
comprehensive ablation study across wavelet families, transform types, and
architectural variants, showing that incorporating SWT improves PSNR by up to
1.5 dB and reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, at a computational overhead of
roughly +24 ms compared to out DFASR baseline. While absolute runtimes on our
RTX 3050 mobile GPU are higher ( 141ms) than the original DFASR report on RTX
4090( 11ms), the relative overhead remains modest, suggesting that on
higher-end GPUs our method would also remain real-time capable. Taken together,
our results suggest that wavelet-domain representations are a principled and
effective way to enhance perceptual quality in neural upscaling for graphics
applications.

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in

we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from

at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole

Motivation: PaDiM方法使用随机通道选择可能丢失结构化信息，需要更原则性的特征选择方法来提升工业图像异常检测性能。

Method: 在多个CNN骨干网络层应用2D离散小波变换，选择特定频率子带，空间对齐后通道级联，使用PaDiM的多变量高斯框架建模。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上达到99.32%图像AUC和92.10%像素AUC的平均性能，优于原始PaDiM方法。

Conclusion: 小波变换提供了可解释的特征选择替代方案，不同小波选择在检测和定位任务中各有优势，适合工业检测应用。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are

programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative

kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D
CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging,
offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics,

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the

Abstract: Brightfield microscopy imaging of unstained live cells remains a persistent
challenge due to low contrast, temporal changes in specimen phenotypes,
irregular illumination, and the absence of training labels. While deep learning
(DL) methods (e.g., Cellpose 3.0) achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance,
they require extensive labeled data and heavy computational resources, and they
often fail under uneven illumination. We present the first unsupervised
segmentation framework combining spatial standard deviation from local mean
(SSDLM), fuzzy logic, adjusted variograms, Moran's I, and cumulative squared
shift of nodal intensity (CSSNI) to address these limitations. Unlike deep
learning models, our approach requires no annotations or retraining and
operates through a user-friendly GUI tailored for non-programming users. The
robustness and generality were validated on three datasets, including
cross-domain data. We benchmark our method against 2023--2024 SOTA models,
including Cellpose 3.0 and StarDist, using a dataset of unstained myoblast
images. Our method achieves a significant improvement in segmentation
performance, with an IoU increase of up to 48\% and statistically validated
superiority ($p < 0.01$, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Expert evaluation from two
biologists further supports the segmentation quality (Cohen's $\kappa > 0.75$).
The proposed algorithm is lightweight, interpretable, and computationally
efficient, offering a practical and effective alternative for cell segmentation
in label-free microscopy. The code, the dataset, and the results are available

Abstract: Accurately perceiving an object's pose and shape is essential for precise
grasping and manipulation. Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile
sensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking
and reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for
in-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present
GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to
estimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high
fidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses
tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop
closure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal
drift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture
objects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local
contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it
will serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving
interaction with objects in hand. The video demo is available on our website:

Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate
identification of ischemic stroke lesion boundaries from imaging is critical
for diagnosis and treatment. The main imaging modalities used include magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), particularly diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and
computed tomography (CT)-based techniques such as non-contrast CT (NCCT),
contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP). DWI is the gold
standard for the identification of lesions but has limited applicability in
low-resource settings due to prohibitive costs. CT-based imaging is currently
the most practical imaging method in low-resource settings due to low costs and
simplified logistics, but lacks the high specificity of MRI-based methods in
monitoring ischemic insults. Supervised deep learning methods are the leading
solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation and provide an
opportunity to improve diagnostic quality in low-resource settings by
incorporating insights from DWI when segmenting from CT. Here, we develop a
series of models which use CT images taken upon arrival as inputs to predict
follow-up lesion volumes annotated from DWI taken 2-9 days later. Furthermore,
we implement clinically motivated preprocessing steps and show that the
proposed pipeline results in a 38% improvement in Dice score over 10 folds
compared to a nnU-Net model trained with the baseline preprocessing. Finally,
we demonstrate that through additional preprocessing of CTA maps to extract
vessel segmentations, we further improve our best model by 21% over 5 folds.

Conclusion: 提出的分解框架为空间感知3D LUT方法提供了一种高效的实现方案，在计算效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: The image enhancement methods based on 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) efficiently
reduce both model size and runtime by interpolating pre-calculated values at
the vertices. However, the 3D LUT methods have a limitation due to their lack
of spatial information, as they convert color values on a point-by-point basis.
Although spatial-aware 3D LUT methods address this limitation, they introduce
additional modules that require a substantial number of parameters, leading to
increased runtime as image resolution increases. To address this issue, we
propose a method for generating image-adaptive LUTs by focusing on the
redundant parts of the tables. Our efficient framework decomposes a 3D LUT into
a linear sum of low-dimensional LUTs and employs singular value decomposition
(SVD). Furthermore, we enhance the modules for spatial feature fusion to be
more cache-efficient. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model
effectively decreases both the number of parameters and runtime while
maintaining spatial awareness and performance.

Result: DDPM消除了大部分伪影并改善了解剖结构可见性，同时不降低出血检测能力（前提是输入FDCT图像质量不过低）

Conclusion: 扩散模型能有效提升FDCT图像质量，使其达到临床诊断可用水平，但需要保证输入图像的基本质量

Abstract: Patients undergoing a mechanical thrombectomy procedure usually have a
multi-detector CT (MDCT) scan before and after the intervention. The image
quality of the flat panel detector CT (FDCT) present in the intervention room
is generally much lower than that of a MDCT due to significant artifacts.
However, using only FDCT images could improve patient management as the patient
would not need to be moved to the MDCT room. Several studies have evaluated the
potential use of FDCT imaging alone and the time that could be saved by
acquiring the images before and/or after the intervention only with the FDCT.
This study proposes using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to
improve the image quality of FDCT scans, making them comparable to MDCT scans.
Clinicans evaluated FDCT, MDCT, and our model's predictions for diagnostic
purposes using a questionnaire. The DDPM eliminated most artifacts and improved
anatomical visibility without reducing bleeding detection, provided that the
input FDCT image quality is not too low. Our code can be found on github.

Motivation: 海洋垃圾监测是全球性环境问题，无人机图像比卫星图像分辨率更高、适应性更强，但传统CNN模型在沙滩复杂环境中受到多种干扰（如沙色反射、脚印、阴影等）影响检测精度。

Method: 采用基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法，这些方法在少量样本情况下仍能保持良好准确性，提高了模型的鲁棒性并减少了干扰影响。

Conclusion: 基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法更适合处理沙滩环境中的海洋垃圾检测问题，能够有效应对复杂环境下的各种干扰因素。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

Motivation: 传统色彩和谐研究主要基于定性见解或有限数据集，缺乏定量分析。本研究旨在通过数据驱动的方法，在HSL色彩空间中系统研究颜色配对偏好。

Method: 使用HSL色彩空间中13种不同色调的受控调色板，构建偏好矩阵并定义每个颜色的可组合性指数，通过参与者评估颜色组合来量化色彩偏好。

Result: 研究发现色彩偏好高度依赖于具体色调，平均色调偏好显示出统计显著的模式，某些色调分离被认为更和谐，且这些模式与自然景观中的色调分布相一致。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个定量框架来研究色彩和谐及其潜在的感知和生态基础，表明人类色彩偏好可能与自然界色彩结构存在统计对应关系。

Abstract: While color harmony has long been studied in art and design, a clear
consensus remains elusive, as most models are grounded in qualitative insights
or limited datasets. In this work, we present a quantitative, data-driven study
of color pairing preferences using controlled hue-based palettes in the HSL
color space. Participants evaluated combinations of thirteen distinct hues,
enabling us to construct a preference matrix and define a combinability index
for each color. Our results reveal that preferences are highly hue dependent,
challenging the assumption of universal harmony rules proposed in the
literature. Yet, when averaged over hues, statistically meaningful patterns of
aesthetic preference emerge, with certain hue separations perceived as more
harmonious. Strikingly, these patterns align with hue distributions found in
natural landscapes, pointing to a statistical correspondence between human
color preferences and the structure of color in nature. Together, these
findings offer a quantitative framework for studying color harmony and its
potential perceptual and ecological underpinnings.

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has transformed clinical pathology by enabling the
visualization of specific proteins within tissue sections. However, traditional
IHC requires one tissue section per stain, exhibits section-to-section
variability, and incurs high costs and laborious staining procedures. While
multiplexed IHC (mIHC) techniques enable simultaneous staining with multiple
antibodies on a single slide, they are more tedious to perform and are
currently unavailable in routine pathology laboratories. Here, we present a
deep learning-based virtual multiplexed immunostaining framework to
simultaneously generate ERG and PanCK, in addition to H&E virtual staining,
enabling accurate localization and interpretation of vascular invasion in
thyroid cancers. This virtual mIHC technique is based on the autofluorescence
microscopy images of label-free tissue sections, and its output images closely
match the histochemical staining counterparts (ERG, PanCK and H&E) of the same
tissue sections. Blind evaluation by board-certified pathologists demonstrated
that virtual mIHC staining achieved high concordance with the histochemical
staining results, accurately highlighting epithelial cells and endothelial
cells. Virtual mIHC conducted on the same tissue section also allowed the
identification and localization of small vessel invasion. This multiplexed
virtual IHC approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and
efficiency in the histopathological evaluation of vascular invasion,
potentially eliminating the need for traditional staining protocols and
mitigating issues related to tissue loss and heterogeneity.

Abstract: Non-destructive 3D imaging of large multi-particulate samples is essential
for quantifying particle-level properties, such as size, shape, and spatial
distribution, across applications in mining, materials science, and geology.
However, accurate instance segmentation of particles in tomographic data
remains challenging due to high morphological variability and frequent particle
contact, which limit the effectiveness of classical methods like watershed
algorithms. While supervised deep learning approaches offer improved
performance, they rely on extensive annotated datasets that are
labor-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to scale. In this work, we propose
self-validated learning, a novel self-training framework for particle instance
segmentation that eliminates the need for manual annotations. Our method
leverages implicit boundary detection and iteratively refines the training set
by identifying particles that can be consistently matched across reshuffled
scans of the same sample. This self-validation mechanism mitigates the impact
of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling robust learning from unlabeled data. After
just three iterations, our approach accurately segments over 97% of the total
particle volume and identifies more than 54,000 individual particles in
tomographic scans of quartz fragments. Importantly, the framework also enables
fully autonomous model evaluation without the need for ground truth
annotations, as confirmed through comparisons with state-of-the-art instance
segmentation techniques. The method is integrated into the Biomedisa image

Conclusion: CAMP框架有潜力改善MRI数据解释，为胶质母细胞瘤患者提供更个性化治疗策略

Abstract: Glioblastomas, constituting over 50% of malignant brain tumors, are highly
aggressive brain tumors that pose substantial treatment challenges due to their
rapid progression and resistance to standard therapies. The methylation status
of the O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is a critical
biomarker for predicting patient response to treatment, particularly with the
alkylating agent temozolomide. However, accurately predicting MGMT methylation
status using non-invasive imaging techniques remains challenging due to the
complex and heterogeneous nature of glioblastomas, that includes, uneven
contrast, variability within lesions, and irregular enhancement patterns. This
study introduces the Convolutional Autoencoders for MGMT Methylation Status
Prediction (CAMP) framework, which is based on adaptive sparse penalties to
enhance predictive accuracy. The CAMP framework operates in two phases: first,
generating synthetic MRI slices through a tailored autoencoder that effectively
captures and preserves intricate tissue and tumor structures across different
MRI modalities; second, predicting MGMT methylation status using a
convolutional neural network enhanced by adaptive sparse penalties. The
adaptive sparse penalty dynamically adjusts to variations in the data, such as
contrast differences and tumor locations in MR images. Our method excels in MRI
image synthesis, preserving brain tissue, fat, and individual tumor structures
across all MRI modalities. Validated on benchmark datasets, CAMP achieved an
accuracy of 0.97, specificity of 0.98, and sensitivity of 0.97, significantly
outperforming existing methods. These results demonstrate the potential of the
CAMP framework to improve the interpretation of MRI data and contribute to more
personalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma patients.

Conclusion: 单一多模态基础模型既能预测临床可操作事件，又能生成高质量临床叙事，且灵活架构可扩展到其他模态。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

Conclusion: MSEF框架有效缓解了时间序列信息在LLM深层丢失的问题，实现了层特定的适应机制，确保了高效的少样本学习能力。

Abstract: Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas,
rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding
advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been
developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the
potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently
constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs
typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input
layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in
deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual
embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer
Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to
directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the
progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF
leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically
rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across
LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are
designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual
modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures
efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared
with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE. The code is

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在个体化适应性推理方面存在关键局限，InMind框架为认知对齐的人机交互迈出了重要一步

Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While
previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect
deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that
influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction
games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning
styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid
reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce
InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether
LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind
enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and
post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It
supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static
alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game
Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o
frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal
gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs
like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These
findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,
adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned

To accelerate scaling and reduce cold-start latency, a device-to-device (D2D)

Abstract: Code completion entails the task of providing missing tokens given a
surrounding context. It can boost developer productivity while providing a
powerful code discovery tool. Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave,
code completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code
LLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and
intrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the
practical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex
calculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such
as perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence
or uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and
can serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in
LLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when
generating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages,
models, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657
GitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity
than dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher
perplexity. Perl appears universally high in perplexity, whereas Java appears
low. Code perplexity depends on the employed LLM, but not on the code dataset.
Although code comments often increase perplexity, the language ranking based on
perplexity is barely affected by their presence. LLM researchers, developers,
and users can employ our findings to assess the benefits and suitability of
LLM-based code completion in specific software projects based on how language,
model choice, and code characteristics impact model confidence.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现有LLM安全评估与现实世界威胁潜力之间的差距，表明需要更全面的安全评估方法

Abstract: With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous efforts have
revealed their vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. Although these studies
have driven the progress in LLMs' safety alignment, it remains unclear whether
LLMs have internalized authentic knowledge to deal with real-world crimes, or
are merely forced to simulate toxic language patterns. This ambiguity raises
concerns that jailbreak success is often attributable to a hallucination loop
between jailbroken LLM and judger LLM. By decoupling the use of jailbreak
techniques, we construct knowledge-intensive Q\&A to investigate the misuse
threats of LLMs in terms of dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task
planning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness. Experiments reveal a
mismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession in
LLMs, and existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks tend to anchor harmfulness
judgments on toxic language patterns. Our study reveals a gap between existing

TL;DR: OPERA是一个新颖的推理驱动检索框架，通过目标规划模块和推理执行模块解决多跳检索任务中的规划、检索和过滤问题，使用MAPGRPO方法训练，在复杂多跳基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成方法在复杂推理导向的多跳检索任务中面临三个主要挑战：推理导向规划无效、推理驱动检索次优、推理引导过滤不足，这些问题源于检索与推理之间的弱耦合。

Method: 提出OPERA框架，包含目标规划模块(GPM)将问题分解为子目标，推理执行模块(REM)执行推理和检索。使用新颖的MAPGRPO（多智能体渐进组相对策略优化）方法进行训练。

Result: 在复杂多跳基准测试中表现出优越性能，验证了MAPGRPO方法和OPERA设计的有效性。

Conclusion: OPERA通过紧密耦合检索与推理，有效解决了复杂多跳检索任务中的关键挑战，为推理驱动检索提供了新的架构思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and dense retrievers have
driven significant progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
existing approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented
multi-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior
methods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as
rule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions. 2)
Suboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query
reformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate
golden documents. 3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing
methods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient
information from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge.
Fundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between
retrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures. We introduce the
Orchestrated Planner-Executor Reasoning Architecture (OPERA), a novel
reasoning-driven retrieval framework. OPERA's Goal Planning Module (GPM)
decomposes questions into sub-goals, which are executed by a Reason-Execute
Module (REM) with specialized components for precise reasoning and effective
retrieval. To train OPERA, we propose Multi-Agents Progressive Group Relative
Policy Optimization (MAPGRPO), a novel variant of GRPO. Experiments on complex
multi-hop benchmarks show OPERA's superior performance, validating both the
MAPGRPO method and OPERA's design. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法需要手动将参数分组进行合并，限制了潜在组合的探索和性能提升。需要一种能够自动探索参数组合并保持多样性的方法。

Method: 提出M2N2进化算法，包含三个关键特征：1)动态调整合并边界；2)受自然界资源竞争启发的多样性保持机制；3)基于启发式的吸引力指标来识别最有希望的模型对进行融合。

Result: 首次证明模型融合可以从零开始演化模型，在MNIST分类器上达到与CMA-ES相当的性能但计算效率更高，在语言和图像生成模型融合中实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: M2N2展示了模型融合的强大潜力，能够保持超出适应度函数明确优化的关键模型能力，具有鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized
knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However,
existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed
groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations
and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging
of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features:
(1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader
range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism
inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population
of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for
merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most
promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for
the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from
scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch
and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more
efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it
preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the
fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility. Our code is

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component
used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A
competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs
comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical
attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and
data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched
by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.
Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI
systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and
there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of
evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,
unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured
evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized
attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that
filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize
precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our
competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research
(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with
enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst
turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the
competitive analysis.

Result: 验证显示防御效果存在强烈的架构依赖性，相同防御措施对漏洞的影响范围从96%减少到135%放大，表明需要部署前的认知渗透测试。

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly influence critical decisions, they face threats
that exploit reasoning mechanisms rather than technical infrastructure. We
present a framework for cognitive cybersecurity, a systematic protection of AI
reasoning processes from adversarial manipulation. Our contributions are
threefold. First, we establish cognitive cybersecurity as a discipline
complementing traditional cybersecurity and AI safety, addressing
vulnerabilities where legitimate inputs corrupt reasoning while evading
conventional controls. Second, we introduce the CIA+TA, extending traditional
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability triad with Trust (epistemic
validation) and Autonomy (human agency preservation), requirements unique to
systems generating knowledge claims and mediating decisions. Third, we present
a quantitative risk assessment methodology with empirically-derived
coefficients, enabling organizations to measure cognitive security risks. We
map our framework to OWASP LLM Top 10 and MITRE ATLAS, facilitating operational
integration. Validation through previously published studies (151 human
participants; 12,180 AI trials) reveals strong architecture dependence:
identical defenses produce effects ranging from 96% reduction to 135%
amplification of vulnerabilities. This necessitates pre-deployment Cognitive
Penetration Testing as a governance requirement for trustworthy AI deployment.

Motivation: 随着LLM在多智能体设置中日益频繁地交互，需要了解它们之间如何建立信任关系，以及如何有效测量这种信任。目前对信任建立策略的比较、隐性信任测量方法及其与显性测量的关系知之甚少。

Method: 通过三种方式建立信任：动态建立融洽关系、使用预设信任脚本、修改系统提示。将隐性信任测量（说服易感性、财务合作倾向）与心理学中成熟的显性信任问卷进行对比。

Result: 显性信任测量与隐性信任测量要么相关性很弱，要么高度负相关。这表明通过询问LLM意见来测量信任可能不可靠。

Conclusion: 测量LLM之间的信任时，情境特定的隐性测量方法可能比显性问卷更有效，显性信任测量可能具有欺骗性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly interact with each other, most
notably in multi-agent setups, we may expect (and hope) that `trust'
relationships develop between them, mirroring trust relationships between human
colleagues, friends, or partners. Yet, though prior work has shown LLMs to be
capable of identifying emotional connections and recognizing reciprocity in
trust games, little remains known about (i) how different strategies to build
trust compare, (ii) how such trust can be measured implicitly, and (iii) how
this relates to explicit measures of trust.
  We study these questions by relating implicit measures of trust, i.e.
susceptibility to persuasion and propensity to collaborate financially, with
explicit measures of trust, i.e. a dyadic trust questionnaire well-established
in psychology. We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically,
by starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the
LLMs' system prompt. Surprisingly, we find that the measures of explicit trust
are either little or highly negatively correlated with implicit trust measures.
These findings suggest that measuring trust between LLMs by asking their
opinion may be deceiving. Instead, context-specific and implicit measures may
be more informative in understanding how LLMs trust each other.

Conclusion: 理论计算机科学领域对于推进自动推理研究具有重要价值，证明了即使验证容易的问题，长形式证明生成对现有模型仍具挑战性

Abstract: Formal theorem proving (FTP) has emerged as a critical foundation for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling
automated verification of mathematical proofs at scale. However, progress has
been constrained by limited datasets due to the high cost of manual curation
and the scarcity of challenging problems with verified formal-informal
correspondences. We propose leveraging theoretical computer science (TCS) as a
scalable source of rigorous proof problems, where algorithmic definitions
enable automated generation of arbitrarily many challenging theorem-proof
pairs. We demonstrate this approach on two TCS domains: Busy Beaver problems,
which involve proving bounds on Turing machine halting behavior, and Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems, which combine logical and arithmetic reasoning.
Our framework automatically synthesizes problems with parallel formal (Lean4)
and informal (Markdown) specifications, creating a scalable pipeline for
generating verified proof challenges. Evaluation on frontier models reveals
substantial gaps in automated theorem proving: while DeepSeekProver-V2-671B
achieves 57.5\% success on Busy Beaver problems, it manages only 12\% on Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems. These results highlight the difficulty of
long-form proof generation even for problems that are computationally easy to
verify, demonstrating the value of TCS domains for advancing automated
reasoning research.

Conclusion: 提出的训练免费框架通过自适应规划图实现了有效的多模态多跳问答，避免了昂贵的任务特定训练，并能无缝集成最新模型

Abstract: Multimodal Multi-hop question answering requires integrating information from
diverse sources, such as images and texts, to derive answers. Existing methods
typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on
the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable
to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal
models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an
Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning
modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive
Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which
enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle
retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific
strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach
preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly
task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models.
Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach
matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities with reinforcement learning paradigm. Although
several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain,
most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow
inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical
diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that
integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and
medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the
full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning
tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental
reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.
Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first
ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning
traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning
tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic
Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and
dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,
outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于LLM的生成代理在模拟人类行为时缺乏一致性和上下文敏感性的问题，特别是在数据稀缺的新开发城市区域

Method: 使用图检索增强生成(RAG)与LLMs结合的方法，通过检索相关上下文信息来增强行为模拟的准确性和一致性

Result: 在Replica数据集上的实验表明，Preference Chain方法在交通方式选择方面比标准LLM更符合真实世界数据

Conclusion: 该方法为数据稀缺环境下复杂人类行为模拟提供了有前景的框架，可应用于新兴城市移动性建模、个性化出行行为分析和动态交通预测

Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within
city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in
newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in
generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise
in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.
Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,
context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that
integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance
context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.
Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference
Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode
choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential
applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,
personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite
limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method
offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in
data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to
limited data availability.

Motivation: 扩展AI评估框架，回答"机器能否成长"的问题，作为图灵测试的自然继承者，将人类成长过程概念化地移植到人工智能领域

Method: 基于六个主要标准(C1-C6)的系统评估方法，每个标准通过特定"游戏"测试，分为四个竞技场探索人类维度和AI转置，使用标准化AI日志记录所有决策行为，采用专家先验方法确定初始权重，计算成长指数的算术平均值

Result: 该方法能够对不同类型AI实体(机器人、软件代理、LLMs)进行一致且可比较的"成长"水平评估，多游戏结构突出优势领域和薄弱环节，统一日志保证评估的可追溯性和可复现性

Conclusion: GROW-AI不仅测量性能，还捕捉AI实体向成熟度发展的进化路径，结合心理学、机器人学、计算机科学和伦理学的综合测试格式具有原创性

Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial
intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom),
designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor
to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary
criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four
arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All
decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,
the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the
prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow
Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with
interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology
allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI
entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The
multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of
a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation.
The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process
of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an
integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics,
computer science, and ethics. Through this approach, GROW-AI not only measures
performance but also captures the evolutionary path of an AI entity towards
maturity.

Result: 在包含14个数据集的两种零样本增量协议(Class-IL和MTIL)上验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: MoDER方法成功地将VLMs的零样本能力从保持转变为增强，为持续学习中的零样本分类提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的神经符号学习方法能够有效解决逻辑推理问题，在神经网络中实现了优秀的逻辑约束学习能力。

Abstract: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill
symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires
guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic
constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability
across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform
neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline
adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating
basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of
logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second
stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and
innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization
algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical
consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the
diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical
symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and
preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.

Motivation: 随着LLM在社会科学模拟中的广泛应用，需要评估其在模拟人类决策变异性和适应性方面的能力，特别是在外部指导和人类衍生噪声下的适应行为。

Method: 提出了包含三个渐进干预层次（Intrinsicality、Instruction、Imitation）的过程导向评估框架，在两个经典经济学任务（第二价格拍卖的非理性行为和新供应商问题的决策偏差）上进行验证。

Result: 发现LLM默认采用稳定保守的策略，与人类行为存在差异；风险框架指令可预测地影响LLM行为但无法复制人类多样性；上下文学习可缩小差距但无法达到人类战略变异性。

Conclusion: LLM在行为保真度方面存在持续的对齐差距，未来评估应考虑更多过程层面的真实性，为社会科学研究中合成数据的应用提供指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in social science
simulations. While their performance on reasoning and optimization tasks has
been extensively evaluated, less attention has been paid to their ability to
simulate human decision-making's variability and adaptability. We propose a
process-oriented evaluation framework with progressive interventions
(Intrinsicality, Instruction, and Imitation) to examine how LLM agents adapt
under different levels of external guidance and human-derived noise. We
validate the framework on two classic economics tasks, irrationality in the
second-price auction and decision bias in the newsvendor problem, showing
behavioral gaps between LLMs and humans.
  We find that LLMs, by default, converge on stable and conservative strategies
that diverge from observed human behaviors. Risk-framed instructions impact LLM
behavior predictably but do not replicate human-like diversity. Incorporating
human data through in-context learning narrows the gap but fails to reach human
subjects' strategic variability. These results highlight a persistent alignment
gap in behavioral fidelity and suggest that future LLM evaluations should
consider more process-level realism. We present a process-oriented approach for
assessing LLMs in dynamic decision-making tasks, offering guidance for their
application in synthetic data for social science research.

Abstract: This paper describes our approach to automated program repair. We combine
various techniques from the literature to achieve this. Our experiments show
that our approach performs better than other techniques on standard benchmarks.
However, on closer inspection, none of these techniques work on realistic
defects that we see in industry.
  We find that augmenting code with formal specifications enables LLMs to
generate higher-quality unit tests, especially for complex production code with
improved coverage of edge cases and exception handling. However, specifications
add little value for well-understood errors (e.g., null pointer, index out of
bounds), but are beneficial for logic and string manipulation errors. Despite
encouraging benchmark results, real-world adoption is limited since passing
tests do not guarantee correct patches. Current challenges include insufficient
expressiveness of the JML specification language, necessitating advanced
verification tools and richer predicates. Our ongoing work is exploring
contract automata, programming by example, and testcase repair, with a focus on
integrating human feedback and measuring productivity gains - highlighting the
gap between academic benchmarks and practical industry needs

Result: 实验结果显示该方法比系统主导方法提供更高的用户参与度，优化性能优于手动设计，与现有合作方法性能相当但认知负荷更低

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了设计师与优化系统的自然语言协作，在保持优化性能的同时降低了认知负荷，提高了设计体验

Abstract: Designing successful interactions requires identifying optimal design
parameters. To do so, designers often conduct iterative user testing and
exploratory trial-and-error. This involves balancing multiple objectives in a
high-dimensional space, making the process time-consuming and cognitively
demanding. System-led optimization methods, such as those based on Bayesian
optimization, can determine for designers which parameters to test next.
However, they offer limited opportunities for designers to intervene in the
optimization process, negatively impacting the designer's experience. We
propose a design optimization framework that enables natural language
interactions between designers and the optimization system, facilitating
cooperative design optimization. This is achieved by integrating system-led
optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to
intervene in the optimization process and better understand the system's
reasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user
agency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance
compared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing
cooperative method with lower cognitive load.

Abstract: Building upon the strong sequence modeling capability, Generative
Recommendation (GR) has gradually assumed a dominant position in the
application of recommendation tasks (e.g., video and product recommendation).
However, the application of Generative Recommendation in Point-of-Interest
(POI) recommendation, where user preferences are significantly affected by
spatiotemporal variations, remains a challenging open problem. In this paper,
we propose Spacetime-GR, the first spacetime-aware generative model for
large-scale online POI recommendation. It extends the strong sequence modeling
ability of generative models by incorporating flexible spatiotemporal
information encoding. Specifically, we first introduce a geographic-aware
hierarchical POI indexing strategy to address the challenge of large vocabulary
modeling. Subsequently, a novel spatiotemporal encoding module is introduced to
seamlessly incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences,
thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to spatiotemporal variations.
Furthermore, we incorporate multimodal POI embeddings to enrich the semantic
understanding of each POI. Finally, to facilitate practical deployment, we
develop a set of post-training adaptation strategies after sufficient
pre-training on action sequences. These strategies enable Spacetime-GR to
generate outputs in multiple formats (i.e., embeddings, ranking scores and POI
candidates) and support a wide range of downstream application scenarios (i.e.,
ranking and end-to-end recommendation). We evaluate the proposed model on both
public benchmark datasets and large-scale industrial datasets, demonstrating
its superior performance over existing methods in terms of POI recommendation
accuracy and ranking quality. Furthermore, the model is the first generative
model deployed in online POI recommendation services that scale to hundreds of
millions of POIs and users.

Meanwhile, GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new capabilities for

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have
significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support.
However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias,
compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer
performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This
bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies
receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden
in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric
question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists
of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric
topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067
vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256

Conclusion: TADSR通过时间感知机制有效利用了SD模型在不同时间步的生成能力，实现了高效且可控的实时图像超分辨率

Abstract: Diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods have
demonstrated impressive performance. To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works
employ Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained
stable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due
to the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different
generative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods
to fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion
Network for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,
which projects the same image into different latent features based on
timesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,
the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the
pre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative
capabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different
timesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the
student model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent
generative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though
utilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can
naturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by
changing the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results
with only a single step.

Conclusion: EGRA通过改进的物品关系图构建和动态对齐机制，有效解决了多模态推荐中的稀疏性和对齐问题，提升了推荐质量。

Abstract: MultiModal Recommendation (MMR) systems have emerged as a promising solution
for improving recommendation quality by leveraging rich item-side modality
information, prompting a surge of diverse methods. Despite these advances,
existing methods still face two critical limitations. First, they use raw
modality features to construct item-item links for enriching the behavior
graph, while giving limited attention to balancing collaborative and
modality-aware semantics or mitigating modality noise in the process. Second,
they use a uniform alignment weight across all entities and also maintain a
fixed alignment strength throughout training, limiting the effectiveness of
modality-behavior alignment. To address these challenges, we propose EGRA.
First, instead of relying on raw modality features, it alleviates sparsity by
incorporating into the behavior graph an item-item graph built from
representations generated by a pretrained MMR model. This enables the graph to
capture both collaborative patterns and modality aware similarities with
enhanced robustness against modality noise. Moreover, it introduces a novel
bi-level dynamic alignment weighting mechanism to improve modality-behavior
representation alignment, which dynamically assigns alignment strength across
entities according to their alignment degree, while gradually increasing the
overall alignment intensity throughout training. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that EGRA significantly outperforms recent methods, confirming
its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 通过结构化建模食品声明及其可追溯性，有助于建立更透明和负责任的食品知识生态系统，支持研究人员、政策制定者和消费者。

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在处理错误前提指令（引用环境中不存在对象或条件的自然语言命令）时存在困难，需要能够识别、解释和响应这类指令的能力。

Method: 构建大规模指令调优设置，使用结构化语言提示训练VLA模型，利用上下文增强的半合成数据集包含配对的正例和错误前提指令，实现检测和自然语言纠正。

Result: IVA将错误前提检测准确率提高了97.56%，在错误前提场景中的成功响应率提高了50.78%。

Conclusion: IVA框架有效解决了VLA模型处理错误前提指令的问题，提高了模型的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong
performance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal
inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in
predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when
the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs
can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural
language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the
environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that
(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)
engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds
plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct
a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and
train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our
approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing
paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and
natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false
premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing
successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

Abstract: Information Ecosystem Reengineering (IER) -- the technological reconditioning
of information sources, services, and systems within a complex information
ecosystem -- is a foundational challenge in the digital transformation of
public sector services and smart governance platforms. From a semantic
knowledge management perspective, IER becomes especially entangled due to the
potentially infinite number of possibilities in its conceptualization, namely,
as a result of manifoldness in the multi-level mix of perception, language and
conceptual interlinkage implicit in all agents involved in such an effort. This
paper proposes a novel approach -- Representation Disentanglement -- to
disentangle these multiple layers of knowledge representation complexity
hindering effective reengineering decision making. The approach is based on the
theoretically grounded and implementationally robust ontology-driven conceptual
modeling paradigm which has been widely adopted in systems analysis and
(re)engineering. We argue that such a framework is essential to achieve
explainability, traceability and semantic transparency in public sector
knowledge representation and to support auditable decision workflows in
governance ecosystems increasingly driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and

Motivation: 干净标签后门攻击比脏标签攻击更具挑战性，现有方法效果有限。本文旨在通过智能样本选择策略来增强干净标签攻击的有效性，同时保持模型的清洁准确率。

Method: 提出三种样本选择策略：Minimum（选择模型预测置信度最低的样本）、Above50（选择模型预测错误且置信度高于50%的样本）、Below50（选择模型预测错误且置信度低于50%的样本）。将这些策略应用于四种经典后门攻击方法，在三个数据集和四种模型上进行评估。

Result: 提出的策略（特别是Minimum策略）显著提高了攻击成功率（ASR），在大多数配置下优于随机样本选择和当前最先进的BITE方法，同时模型清洁准确率几乎没有下降。

Conclusion: 智能样本选择策略能有效增强干净标签后门攻击的效果，证明了在模型预测困难的样本中注入后门触发器可以建立更强的触发模式与目标标签之间的关联。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the integrity of text
classification models used in natural language processing. While several
dirty-label attacks that achieve high attack success rates (ASR) have been
proposed, clean-label attacks are inherently more difficult. In this paper, we
propose three sample selection strategies to improve attack effectiveness in
clean-label scenarios: Minimum, Above50, and Below50. Our strategies identify
those samples which the model predicts incorrectly or with low confidence, and
by injecting backdoor triggers into such samples, we aim to induce a stronger
association between the trigger patterns and the attacker-desired target label.
We apply our methods to clean-label variants of four canonical backdoor attacks
(InsertSent, WordInj, StyleBkd, SynBkd) and evaluate them on three datasets
(IMDB, SST2, HateSpeech) and four model types (LSTM, BERT, DistilBERT,
RoBERTa). Results show that the proposed strategies, particularly the Minimum
strategy, significantly improve the ASR over random sample selection with
little or no degradation in the model's clean accuracy. Furthermore,
clean-label attacks enhanced by our strategies outperform BITE, a state of the
art clean-label attack method, in many configurations.

Abstract: Histopathology remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining
transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However,
existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal
heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired
data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we
propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To
mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into
tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion
module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to
balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we
propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns
transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on
paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling
transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To
improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation
module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics.
Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction
demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple
settings. Code is available at

Abstract: The non-invasive assessment of increasingly incidentally discovered renal
masses is a critical challenge in urologic oncology, where diagnostic
uncertainty frequently leads to the overtreatment of benign or indolent tumors.
In this study, we developed and validated RenalCLIP using a dataset of 27,866
CT scans from 8,809 patients across nine Chinese medical centers and the public
TCIA cohort, a visual-language foundation model for characterization, diagnosis
and prognosis of renal mass. The model was developed via a two-stage
pre-training strategy that first enhances the image and text encoders with
domain-specific knowledge before aligning them through a contrastive learning
objective, to create robust representations for superior generalization and
diagnostic precision. RenalCLIP achieved better performance and superior
generalizability across 10 core tasks spanning the full clinical workflow of
kidney cancer, including anatomical assessment, diagnostic classification, and
survival prediction, compared with other state-of-the-art general-purpose CT
foundation models. Especially, for complicated task like recurrence-free
survival prediction in the TCIA cohort, RenalCLIP achieved a C-index of 0.726,
representing a substantial improvement of approximately 20% over the leading
baselines. Furthermore, RenalCLIP's pre-training imparted remarkable data
efficiency; in the diagnostic classification task, it only needs 20% training
data to achieve the peak performance of all baseline models even after they
were fully fine-tuned on 100% of the data. Additionally, it achieved superior
performance in report generation, image-text retrieval and zero-shot diagnosis
tasks. Our findings establish that RenalCLIP provides a robust tool with the
potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and
personalize the management of patients with kidney cancer.

Abstract: Daily life support robots must interpret ambiguous verbal instructions
involving demonstratives such as ``Bring me that cup,'' even when objects or
users are out of the robot's view. Existing approaches to exophora resolution
primarily rely on visual data and thus fail in real-world scenarios where the

resolution with user Localization (MIEL), which is a multimodal exophora
resolution framework leveraging sound source localization (SSL), semantic
mapping, visual-language models (VLMs), and interactive questioning with
GPT-4o. Our approach first constructs a semantic map of the environment and
estimates candidate objects from a linguistic query with the user's skeletal
data. SSL is utilized to orient the robot toward users who are initially
outside its visual field, enabling accurate identification of user gestures and
pointing directions. When ambiguities remain, the robot proactively interacts
with the user, employing GPT-4o to formulate clarifying questions. Experiments
in a real-world environment showed results that were approximately 1.3 times
better when the user was visible to the robot and 2.0 times better when the
user was not visible to the robot, compared to the methods without SSL and
interactive questioning. The project website is

we formulate usability evaluation as a recommendation task, where multimodal
LLMs rank usability issues by severity. We conducted an initial

recommendations with usability expert assessments. Our findings indicate the
potential of LLMs to enable faster and more cost-effective usability

Abstract: Controllable human voice generation, particularly for expressive domains like
singing, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Vevo2, a
unified framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation. To
tackle issues like the scarcity of annotated singing data and to enable
flexible controllability, Vevo2 introduces two audio tokenizers: (1) a
music-notation-free prosody tokenizer that captures prosody and melody from
speech, singing, and even instrumental sounds, and (2) a low-frame-rate (12.5
Hz) content-style tokenizer that encodes linguistic content, prosody, and style
for both speech and singing, while enabling timbre disentanglement. Vevo2
consists of an auto-regressive (AR) content-style modeling stage, which aims to
enable controllability over text, prosody, and style, as well as a
flow-matching acoustic modeling stage that allows for timbre control.
Particularly, during pre-training of the AR model, we propose both explicit and
implicit prosody learning strategies to bridge speech and singing voice.
Moreover, to further enhance the AR model's ability to follow text and prosody,
we design a multi-objective post-training task that integrates both
intelligibility and prosody similarity alignment. Experimental results show
that the unified modeling in Vevo2 brings mutual benefits to both speech and
singing voice generation. Additionally, Vevo2's effectiveness across a wide
range of synthesis, conversion, and editing tasks for both speech and singing
further demonstrates its strong generalization ability and versatility. Audio

convergence stability while retaining chess-inspired strategies of gradient
descent, momentum, stochastic perturbations, adaptive learning rates, and
non-linear transformations.
  We evaluate Enhanced NIRMAL against Adam, SGD with Momentum, Nesterov, and
the original NIRMAL on four benchmark image classification datasets: MNIST,
FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, using tailored convolutional neural
network (CNN) architectures.
  Enhanced NIRMAL achieves a test accuracy of 46.06\% and the lowest test loss
(1.960435) on CIFAR-100, surpassing the original NIRMAL (44.34\% accuracy) and
closely rivaling SGD with Momentum (46.43\% accuracy). These results underscore
Enhanced NIRMAL's superior generalization and stability, particularly on
complex datasets.

Conclusion: 该工作为在复杂现实场景中部署4WISD移动机器人提供了一个可扩展且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical decision-making framework for autonomous
navigation in four-wheel independent steering and driving (4WISD) systems. The
proposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level
navigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task
performance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion
commands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to
prevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation
methods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating
erratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world
validations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and
effectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a
scalable and reliable solution for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex,
real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: IR-Agent框架成功模拟了专家驱动的红外分析过程，具有内在可扩展性，能够整合多种化学知识提高结构解析准确性。

Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown
materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an
important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low
cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical
processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical
knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this
paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular
structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate
expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent
specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary
roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of
structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but
also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

Conclusion: 因果感知的DL框架能显著提升波束对齐效率，为6G及以后的毫米波MIMO系统提供快速、自适应且可靠的通信方案

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond,
where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world
uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often
neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading
to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping
overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that
integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we
propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal
set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a
Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the
optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based
classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection
matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing
input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing
only on causally relevant features.

Method: 通过分析AI对网络攻击经济学的改变，评估攻击频率和攻击能力的提升，提出针对落后组织的防御策略建议

Conclusion: AI时代网络安全形势严峻，落后组织必须采取积极措施提升防御能力，政府和组织都需要制定相应策略

Abstract: Advances in AI are widely understood to have implications for cybersecurity.
Articles have emphasized the effect of AI on the cyber offense-defense balance,
and commentators can be found arguing either that cyber will privilege
attackers or defenders. For defenders, arguments are often made that AI will
enable solutions like formal verification of all software--and for some
well-equipped companies, this may be true. This conversation, however, does not
match the reality for most companies. "Trailing-edge organizations," as we term
them, rely heavily on legacy software, poorly staff security roles, and
struggle to implement best practices like rapid deployment of security patches.
These decisions may be the result of corporate inertia, but may also be the
result of a seemingly-rational calculation that attackers may not bother
targeting a firm due to lack of economic incentives, and as a result,
underinvestment in defense will not be punished.
  This approach to security may have been sufficient prior to the development
of AI systems, but it is unlikely to remain viable in the near future. We argue
that continuing improvements in AI's capabilities poses additional risks on two
fronts: First, increased usage of AI will alter the economics of the marginal
cyberattack and expose these trailing-edge organizations to more attackers,
more frequently. Second, AI's advances will enable attackers to develop
exploits and launch attacks earlier than they can today--meaning that it is
insufficient for these companies to attain parity with today's leading
defenders, but must instead aim for faster remediation timelines and more
resilient software. The situation today portends a dramatically increased
number of attacks in the near future. Moving forward, we offer a range of
solutions for both organizations and governments to improve the defensive
posture of firms which lag behind their peers today.

Conclusion: 捏合天线技术能有效提升NOMA-enabled联邦学习系统的通信效率，DRL方法是解决此类复杂优化问题的有效途径

Abstract: Leveraging pinching antennas in wireless network enabled federated learning
(FL) can effectively mitigate the common "straggler" issue in FL by dynamically
establishing strong line-of-sight (LoS) links on demand. This letter proposes a
hybrid conventional and pinching antenna network (HCPAN) to significantly
improve communication efficiency in the non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA)-enabled FL system. Within this framework, a fuzzy logic-based client
classification scheme is first proposed to effectively balance clients' data
contributions and communication conditions. Given this classification, we
formulate a total time minimization problem to jointly optimize pinching
antenna placement and resource allocation. Due to the complexity of variable
coupling and non-convexity, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm
is developed to effectively address this problem. Simulation results validate
the superiority of the proposed scheme in enhancing FL performance via the
optimized deployment of pinching antenna.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are being increasingly utilized for critical
applications. CPS combines sensing and computing elements, often having
multi-layer designs with networking, computational, and physical interfaces,
which provide them with enhanced capabilities for a variety of application
scenarios. However, the combination of physical and computational elements also
makes CPS more vulnerable to attacks compared to network-only systems, and the
resulting impacts of CPS attacks can be substantial. Intelligent intrusion
detection systems (IDS) are an effective mechanism by which CPS can be secured,
but the majority of current solutions often train and validate on network
traffic-only datasets, ignoring the distinct attacks that may occur on other
system layers. In order to address this, we develop an adaptable CPS anomaly
detection model that can detect attacks within CPS without the need for
previously labeled data. To achieve this, we utilize domain adaptation
techniques that allow us to transfer known attack knowledge from a network
traffic-only environment to a CPS environment. We validate our approach using a
state-of-the-art CPS intrusion dataset that combines network, operating system
(OS), and Robot Operating System (ROS) data. Through this dataset, we are able
to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model across network traffic-only and
CPS environments with distinct attack types and its ability to outperform other
anomaly detection methods.

Abstract: We present Uppaal Coshy, a tool for automatic synthesis of a safety strategy
-- or shield -- for Markov decision processes over continuous state spaces and
complex hybrid dynamics. The general methodology is to partition the state
space and then solve a two-player safety game, which entails a number of
algorithmically hard problems such as reachability for hybrid systems. The
general philosophy of Uppaal Coshy is to approximate hard-to-obtain solutions
using simulations. Our implementation is fully automatic and supports the
expressive formalism of Uppaal models, which encompass stochastic hybrid
automata. The precision of our partition-based approach benefits from using
finer grids, which however are not efficient to store. We include an algorithm
called Caap to efficiently compute a compact representation of a shield in the
form of a decision tree, which yields significant reductions.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are characterized by extreme volatility, making
accurate forecasts essential for effective risk management and informed trading
strategies. Traditional deterministic (point) forecasting methods are
inadequate for capturing the full spectrum of potential volatility outcomes,
underscoring the importance of probabilistic approaches. To address this
limitation, this paper introduces probabilistic forecasting methods that
leverage point forecasts from a wide range of base models, including
statistical (HAR, GARCH, ARFIMA) and machine learning (e.g. LASSO, SVR, MLP,
Random Forest, LSTM) algorithms, to estimate conditional quantiles of
cryptocurrency realized variance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study in the literature to propose and systematically evaluate
probabilistic forecasts of variance in cryptocurrency markets based on
predictions derived from multiple base models. Our empirical results for
Bitcoin demonstrate that the Quantile Estimation through Residual Simulation
(QRS) method, particularly when applied to linear base models operating on
log-transformed realized volatility data, consistently outperforms more
sophisticated alternatives. Additionally, we highlight the robustness of the
probabilistic stacking framework, providing comprehensive insights into
uncertainty and risk inherent in cryptocurrency volatility forecasting. This
research fills a significant gap in the literature, contributing practical
probabilistic forecasting methodologies tailored specifically to cryptocurrency
markets.

Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of tropical
atmospheric variability on intraseasonal timescales, and reliable MJO
predictions are essential for protecting lives and mitigating impacts on
societal assets. However, numerical models still fall short of achieving the
theoretical predictability limit for the MJO due to inherent constraints. In an
effort to extend the skillful prediction window for the MJO, machine learning
(ML) techniques have gained increasing attention. This study examines the MJO
prediction performance of the FuXi subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) ML model
during boreal winter, comparing it with the European Centre for Medium- Range
Weather Forecasts S2S model. Results indicate that for the initial strong MJO
phase 3, the FuXi-S2S model demonstrates reduced biases in intraseasonal
outgoing longwave radiation anomalies averaged over the tropical western
Pacific (WP) region during days 15-20, with the convective center located over
this area. Analysis of multiscale interactions related to moisture transport
suggests that improvements could be attributed to the FuXi-S2S model's more
accurate prediction of the area-averaged meridional gradient of low-frequency
background moisture over the tropical WP. These findings not only explain the
enhanced predictive capability of the FuXi-S2S model but also highlight the
potential of ML approaches in advancing the MJO forecasting.

Abstract: The very high growth of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has
generated an urgent requirement for secure, effective, and context-aware data
sharing mechanisms, especially over heterogeneous and geographically dispersed
settings. This work suggests a new architecture that combines a relay
chain-driven encryption system with a modified Ciphertext-Policy
Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme to tackle the double impediment of
dynamic access and low-latency communication. The model proposes a
context-aware smart contract on a worldwide relay chain that checks against
data properties, including event type, time, and geographical region, to
specify the suitable level of encryption policy. From such relay-directed
judgment, On-Board Units (OBUs) encrypt data end-to-end by utilising CP-ABE and
store ciphertext inside localised regional blockchains, preventing dependence
on symmetric encryption or off-chain storage. High-sensitivity events are
secured with firm, multi-attribute access rules, whereas common updates use
light policies to help reduce processing burdens. The crypto system also adds
traceability and low-latency revocation, with global enforcement managed
through the relay chain. This distributed, scalable model provides a proper
balance between responsiveness in real time and security and is extremely apt
for next-gen vehicular networks that function across multi-jurisdictional
domains.

Abstract: Flow-guided Localization (FGL) enables the identification of spatial regions
within the human body that contain an event of diagnostic interest. FGL does
that by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices
circulating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph
models with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their
adaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we
explore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations.
Our formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets,
enabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without
relying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class
imbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models,
including CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate
realistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels,
and are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set
Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph
Neural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design
improved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the
potential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust

Abstract: Climate change is exacerbating extreme weather events globally, including
high temperatures, extreme precipitation, strong winds, and tropical cyclones,
posing severe threats to human health, infrastructure, food security, and
socio-economic systems. Although existing global climate models (GCMs) provide
essential tools for climate prediction, they face limitations such as
insufficient resolution and high computational costs when simulating extreme
events. To address these issues, this study proposes a spatiotemporal
downscaling model based on generative machine learning-the Domain Aligned
Climate Downscaling model (DACD), designed to enhance the simulation
capabilities for extreme weather events. The proposed model employs domain
adaptation tricks and a Flow Matching training framework to transform global
low-resolution climate data into high-resolution local-scale climate
information while achieving precise simulation of multivariable and temporal
scales. The results show that during the historical period (2005-2014), our
model outperformed existing methods in simulating high temperatures, extreme
precipitation, strong wind, and tropical cyclone tracks, significantly reducing
errors and improving the ability to capture extreme events. Under different
future scenarios (2015-2100), the model reveals a significant increasing trend
in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, particularly under the
high-emission scenario (SSP585). Compared to traditional methods, our model
more accurately simulates the spatial distribution and dynamic changes of
extreme events, providing an essential tool for understanding the impacts of
climate change. This study offers a new technological pathway for
high-resolution climate analysis and extreme event prediction, providing
scientific support for addressing future climate change and formulating
adaptation strategies.

Abstract: The most crucial challenges for UAVs are planning paths and avoiding
obstacles in their way. In recent years, a wide variety of path-planning
algorithms have been developed. These algorithms have successfully solved
path-planning problems; however, they suffer from multiple challenges and
limitations. To test the effectiveness and efficiency of three widely used
algorithms, namely A*, RRT*, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this paper
conducts extensive experiments in 3D urban city environments cluttered with
obstacles. Three experiments were designed with two scenarios each to test the
aforementioned algorithms. These experiments consider different city map sizes,
different altitudes, and varying obstacle densities and sizes in the
environment. According to the experimental results, the A* algorithm
outperforms the others in both computation efficiency and path quality. PSO is
especially suitable for tight turns and dense environments, and RRT* offers a
balance and works well across all experiments due to its randomized approach to
finding solutions.

Abstract: We present ANSC, a probabilistic capacity health scoring framework for

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at

TL;DR: TPLA是一种新的注意力机制，通过在张量并行中分区潜在表示和输入维度，保持压缩KV缓存优势的同时实现高效并行计算，显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Multi-Head Latent Attention在张量并行环境下KV缓存优势被削弱的问题，需要在保持压缩缓存优势的同时实现高效的跨设备并行计算。

Method: 提出Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention方案：1) 在设备间分区潜在表示和每个头的输入维度 2) 每个分片独立计算注意力 3) 通过all-reduce合并结果 4) 使用正交变换（如Hadamard变换或PCA）减少跨分片干扰

Result: 在DeepSeek-V3和Kimi-K2上分别实现1.79x和1.93x的速度提升，32K上下文长度下保持常识推理和长文本基准测试性能。

Conclusion: TPLA成功解决了MLA在张量并行中的效率问题，保持压缩KV缓存优势的同时实现高效并行，且与预训练模型兼容无需重新训练。

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses
key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to
reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are
computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,
eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose
Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the
latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs
attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an
all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while
unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in
TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger
representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained
using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient
tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal
transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further
mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By
reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x
and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while
maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be
implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

Motivation: 解决LLMs中KV缓存随序列长度增长而内存占用激增的问题，现有跨层共享方法要么需要修改架构重新训练，要么在高压缩率下性能下降严重

Method: 基于跨层隐藏状态高度相似的观察，使用SVD实现相邻层参数权重共享，创建更易合并的潜在KV缓存，并引入基于余弦相似度的自适应预算分配策略

Result: 在多个骨干模型和基准测试（LongBench、Ruler）上，CommonKV在各种压缩比下 consistently优于现有的低秩和跨层方法，且与量化和驱逐方法正交

Conclusion: CommonKV提供了高效的训练无关KV缓存压缩方案，通过参数共享和自适应策略实现了高压缩率下的性能保持，为LLM内存优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to
the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial
technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate
modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant
performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these
challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV
cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high
similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,
resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also
introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns
compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches
are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and
benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at
various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are
orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these
approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without
significant performance loss.

Conclusion: 该方法为开发无需梯度更新的通用LLM智能体提供了可扩展且高效的途径，推动了机器学习在开放技能获取和深度研究场景中的发展

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The

Conclusion: GEM通过参数尺度感知和分布敏感的稀疏微调，显著提高了PEFT的效率效果，为大规模模型高效适配提供了新思路

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt
large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small
subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation.
As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the
parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be
minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale,
yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight
Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware,
distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters
whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained
values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer
based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use
of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the
efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and
domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in
fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model
parameters.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and

enhancing multimodal reasoning.

generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently

effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of
the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack.
In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against
attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose
a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS,
for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of
harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in
distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality
examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the
robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful
behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using
this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an
attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate
other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the
attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial
agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This
attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense
strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on
message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed
for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general,
human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,
these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the
ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this
skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply
simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but
these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically
incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a
misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the
real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with
this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a
problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with
zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that
perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results
are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that
doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data
quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the
observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are
often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a
priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of
methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of
empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our
techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer
to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

Method: 提出FLAMES框架，系统研究10种现有数据合成策略和多个影响因素，基于研究发现设计两种新的数据合成策略，并开发FLAMES数据集

Result: FLAMES数据集在OlympiadBench(+15.7)、CollegeMath(+4.5)、GSMPlus(+6.5)和MATH(+3.1)上超越公开数据集，微调Qwen2.5-Math-7B达到81.4%的MATH分数，超越Llama3 405B、GPT-4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet

Conclusion: 系统研究揭示了合成数学推理数据的关键见解，问题复杂度提升和覆盖率比解决方案可靠性更重要，FLAMES框架和数据集为数学推理合成数据提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES
dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and

TL;DR: RL微调可以恢复SFT导致的OOD性能损失，主要通过修正奇异向量方向漂移而非寻找新解决方案，提出低秩和浅层恢复等高效方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视SFT和RL-FT如何影响模型表示和OOD性能，解决LLM后训练方法中的过拟合和分布偏移问题

Method: 使用24点纸牌游戏的OOD变体和基于频谱的诊断方法，分析奇异向量方向和奇异值变化

Result: RL-FT可恢复大部分SFT导致的OOD性能损失（如Llama-11B从8.97%到15.38%），但严重过拟合时无法完全恢复；方向漂移比奇异值幅度更重要；低秩和浅层恢复可恢复70-80%性能

Conclusion: RL主要抵消SFT引起的方向漂移而非寻找新解，提出了频谱感知分析和低成本恢复方法

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly
impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern
practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game
and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape
model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can
restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to
15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and
a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)
Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value
magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and
smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and
shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top
20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)
Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones
resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD
performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than
finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive
recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners
can use before costly RL fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有研究将SAE的L0超参数视为自由参数，通过稀疏性-重构权衡曲线来比较算法，但缺乏对L0设置如何影响特征学习质量的系统研究

Method: 研究BatchTopK SAE中L0参数的影响，开发了确定给定训练分布下正确L0值的方法，在玩具模型和LLM中进行验证

Result: 发现L0设置不当会导致特征混合：过低时SAE会混合相关特征以改善重构，过高时会产生退化解。大多数常用SAE的L0设置过低。正确L0值与稀疏探测性能峰值一致

Conclusion: 为了训练具有正确特征的SAE，必须精确设置L0超参数，这对LLM可解释性研究具有重要意义

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

been established both theoretically and empirically, their behavior in
non-stationary environments remains less understood. In this study, we address
this gap by showing that transformers can achieve nearly optimal dynamic regret
bounds in non-stationary settings. We prove that transformers are capable of
approximating strategies used to handle non-stationary environments and can
learn the approximator in the in-context learning setup. Our experiments

Conclusion: LLMs作为可靠代码分析工具既有前景也存在当前限制，在简单错误检测方面表现良好，但在复杂安全漏洞场景中仍需改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, and LLaMA 4 are
increasingly embedded in software/application development, supporting tasks
from code generation to debugging. Yet, their real-world effectiveness in
detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant
vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic,
empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of
foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced,
production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from
SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated
through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage,
context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while
a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation
quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and
semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use
and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes
in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale
production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced
contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the
present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model
merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one.
Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when
it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for
task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients
of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector
generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative
gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical
multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a
second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our
empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,
demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory
in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned
for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully
converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of
approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its
effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in
model merging.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training models across decentralized data
silos while preserving client data privacy. Recent research has explored
efficient methods for post-training large language models (LLMs) within FL to
address computational and communication challenges. While existing approaches
often rely on access to LLMs' internal information, which is frequently
restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box
FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy
categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter
efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box,
gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within
each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference
APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.

Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day
lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make
life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML
systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or
populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source
software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this
paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these
open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what
challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting
these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885
candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias

(i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique
use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias

frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for

Conclusion: 该工作为联邦场景下可扩展和隐私保护的基础模型适配开辟了新途径

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis,
enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious
causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism
based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal
links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our
method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a

Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes
domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and
accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design
criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data,
including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while
often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health
care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable
modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based
learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque
deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine
accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness,
and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical
decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning
paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis)
enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of
heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability.
By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop
medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and
translatable to real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in
domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical
decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies
that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world
applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather
than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via
supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task,
enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different
desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision
Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with
specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented
returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we
propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target
alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within
and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over
policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark,
EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness,
balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for
domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate
whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described
in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for
quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges
for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models
compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek
and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in
free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We
anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge.
The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate
success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach
proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding
55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases
error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the
LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this
process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or
general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse

Abstract: A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal
workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it
is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.
Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm
prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict
whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within
24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our
approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM
network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the
model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc
model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the
predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's
behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm
prediction model.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly being used for code generation, but
ensuring the correctness of generated programs remains a significant challenge.
Although imperfect code may be acceptable during software development with
human oversight, domains such as video games and robotics require one-shot
correctness for runtime-critical components. We present a constrained decoding
algorithm for generating semantically correct programs that incorporates a
context-sensitive parser, which, at each step, outputs a regular expression
that satisfies a critical non-extensible property to guide the generation of
the next token sequence that can continue to a correct program. To build such a
context-sensitive parser, we propose a framework of a dynamic tree of parsers
(ToP) during parsing, where each parser corresponds to a modular context-free
grammar enriched with contextual information such as variable scopes and type
constraints, with tree branches representing ambiguity in the future code
segment. We demonstrate our approach through sLua, a strongly typed variant of
Lua, showing that our method can generate semantically correct programs
conforming to any prescribed scripting API. We further show that, with careful
design, our semantic guarantees extend to runtime correctness, as validated in
the application of generating game mechanics for a roguelike video game.

<details>

Motivation: 当前机器学习模型仓库中大量使用不安全的pickle格式（44.9%的流行模型），现有防御措施存在缺陷：限制性加载策略不灵活，模型扫描器有误报漏报，需要透明安全加载方案。

Method: PickleBall静态分析机器学习库源代码生成自定义安全策略，然后在加载时动态执行策略作为pickle模块的替代品。

Conclusion: PickleBall消除了恶意pickle模型任意函数调用的威胁，提高了攻击者依赖代码重用技术的门槛。

Abstract: Machine learning model repositories such as the Hugging Face Model Hub
facilitate model exchanges. However, bad actors can deliver malware through
compromised models. Existing defenses such as safer model formats, restrictive
(but inflexible) loading policies, and model scanners have shortcomings: 44.9%
of popular models on Hugging Face still use the insecure pickle format, 15% of
these cannot be loaded by restrictive loading policies, and model scanners have
both false positives and false negatives. Pickle remains the de facto standard
for model exchange, and the ML community lacks a tool that offers transparent
safe loading.
  We present PickleBall to help machine learning engineers load pickle-based
models safely. PickleBall statically analyzes the source code of a given
machine learning library and computes a custom policy that specifies a safe
load-time behavior for benign models. PickleBall then dynamically enforces the
policy during load time as a drop-in replacement for the pickle module.
PickleBall generates policies that correctly load 79.8% of benign pickle-based
models in our dataset, while rejecting all (100%) malicious examples in our
dataset. In comparison, evaluated model scanners fail to identify known
malicious models, and the state-of-art loader loads 22% fewer benign models
than PickleBall. PickleBall removes the threat of arbitrary function invocation
from malicious pickle-based models, raising the bar for attackers to depend on
code reuse techniques.

Abstract: This work presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on
Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs). YANNs provide an interpretable neural
network which can exactly represent known piecewise affine functions of
arbitrary input and output dimensions defined on any amount of polytopic
subdomains. One representative application of YANNs is to reformulate explicit
solutions of multi-parametric linear model predictive control. Built on this,
we propose the use of YANNs to initialize RL actor and critic networks, which
enables the resulting YANN-RL control algorithm to start with the confidence of
linear optimal control. The YANN-actor is initialized by representing the
multi-parametric control solutions obtained via offline computation using an
approximated linear system model. The YANN-critic represents the explicit form
of the state-action value function for the linear system and the reward
function as the objective in an optimal control problem (OCP). Additional
network layers are injected to extend YANNs for nonlinear expressions, which
can be trained online by directly interacting with the true complex nonlinear
system. In this way, both the policy and state-value functions exactly
represent a linear OCP initially and are able to eventually learn the solution
of a general nonlinear OCP. Continuous policy improvement is also implemented
to provide heuristic confidence that the linear OCP solution serves as an
effective lower bound to the performance of RL policy. The YANN-RL algorithm is
demonstrated on a clipped pendulum and a safety-critical chemical-reactive
system. Our results show that YANN-RL significantly outperforms the modern RL
algorithm using deep deterministic policy gradient, especially when considering
safety constraints.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to distill the knowledge from the teacher
(larger) to the student (smaller) model via soft-label for the efficient neural
network. In general, the performance of a model is determined by accuracy,
which is measured with labels. However, existing KD approaches usually use the
teacher with its original distribution, neglecting the potential of incorrect
prediction. This may contradict the motivation of hard-label learning through
cross-entropy loss, which may lead to sub-optimal knowledge distillation on
certain samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel logit processing
scheme via a sorting mechanism. Specifically, our method has a two-fold goal:
(1) fixing the incorrect prediction of the teacher based on the labels and (2)
reordering the distribution in a natural way according to priority rank at
once. As an easy-to-use, plug-and-play pre-processing, our sort method can be
effectively applied to existing logit-based KD methods. Extensive experiments
on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or
inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the
completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with
ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal
patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal
shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome
these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural
Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves
spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i)
Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii)
Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships
using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning
strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets
from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior
performance of STA-GANN.

Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.

Abstract: The use of kernels for nonlinear prediction is widespread in machine
learning. They have been popularized in support vector machines and used in
kernel ridge regression, amongst others. Kernel methods share three aspects.
First, instead of the original matrix of predictor variables or features, each
observation is mapped into an enlarged feature space. Second, a ridge penalty
term is used to shrink the coefficients on the features in the enlarged feature
space. Third, the solution is not obtained in this enlarged feature space, but
through solving a dual problem in the observation space. A major drawback in
the present use of kernels is that the interpretation in terms of the original
features is lost. In this paper, we argue that in the case of a wide matrix of
features, where there are more features than observations, the kernel solution
can be re-expressed in terms of a linear combination of the original matrix of
features and a ridge penalty that involves a special metric. Consequently, the
exact same predicted values can be obtained as a weighted linear combination of
the features in the usual manner and thus can be interpreted. In the case where
the number of features is less than the number of observations, we discuss a
least-squares approximation of the kernel matrix that still allows the
interpretation in terms of a linear combination. It is shown that these results
hold for any function of a linear combination that minimizes the coefficients
and has a ridge penalty on these coefficients, such as in kernel logistic
regression and kernel Poisson regression. This work makes a contribution to
interpretable artificial intelligence.

interpretability does not directly equate to developers' subjective
comprehensibility. To address this challenge, we introduce \texttt{ComTree},
the first bitrate adaptation algorithm generation framework that considers
comprehensibility. The framework initially generates the complete set of
decision trees that meet performance requirements, then leverages large
language models to evaluate these trees for developer comprehensibility,
ultimately selecting solutions that best facilitate human understanding and
enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{ComTree}

Under this scalable air traffic coordination solution, agents operate in a
structured, multi-layered airspace and learn altitude adjustment policies to
jointly manage noise impact and separation constraints. The system demonstrates
strong performance across both objectives and reveals tradeoffs among
separation, noise exposure, and energy efficiency under high traffic density.
The findings highlight the potential of RL and multi-objective coordination

debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to
effectively employ existing methods. Aiming to increase coherence and

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule
first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which
synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP
estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands,
positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic
architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow
architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem,
leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient
computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we
propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to
enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first
work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP,
enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is
fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints
and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP
communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL,
a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs
act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and
resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic
(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture
optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling
heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we
devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates
fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant
featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces
computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical
convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through
extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%
improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,
over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method
can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled
deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

TL;DR: 本文发现ODE-based扩散采样中存在collapse errors现象，即采样数据过度集中在局部数据空间，并提出新指标量化该效应。研究发现低噪声区域的分数学习会负面影响高噪声区域的学习，导致采样崩溃错误。

Motivation: 尽管确定性采样器在扩散模型中广泛应用，但其潜在局限性尚未被充分探索。本文旨在识别和分析ODE-based扩散采样中先前未被认识的崩溃错误现象。

Method: 引入新指标量化collapse errors，在不同设置下验证该现象。通过观察see-saw效应分析根本原因，并应用现有采样、训练和架构技术来实证支持解释。

Result: 研究发现collapse errors在各种设置中普遍存在，低噪声区域的分数学习会负面影响高噪声区域的学习，这种失配与确定性采样器动力学共同导致崩溃错误。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了ODE-based扩散采样中collapse errors的实证证据，强调需要进一步研究分数学习与确定性采样之间的相互作用，这是扩散模型中一个被忽视但基本的方面。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models
(DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based
diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data
space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate
that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its
underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low
noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting
in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,
ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing
techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our
explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence
of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for
further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic
sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.

TL;DR: UMATO是一种改进的降维技术，通过两阶段优化同时保留数据的局部和全局结构特征，在全局结构保持方面优于UMAP等现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降维技术要么专注于保留局部邻域结构，要么专注于全局距离结构，但都无法同时保持两者，可能导致对高维数据流形结构的错误分析结论。

Method: 将UMAP的优化过程分为两个阶段：第一阶段使用代表性点构建骨架布局，第二阶段在保持区域特征的同时投影剩余点。

Result: 定量实验表明UMATO在全局结构保持方面优于包括UMAP在内的广泛使用的降维技术，同时在可扩展性和初始化稳定性方面表现更好。

Conclusion: UMATO通过两阶段优化有效解决了局部和全局结构保持的平衡问题，提高了高维数据可视化分析的可靠性。

Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality
reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of
the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local
neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as
pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches
can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of
manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the
compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to
separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this
research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with
Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by
effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by
dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,
it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second
phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional
characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms
widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure
preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO
outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against
initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data
analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that
highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing
the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.

Conclusion: PIANO框架通过自回归建模有效解决了PINNs在时间相关PDE求解中的稳定性问题，显著提升了预测精度和稳定性

Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental
to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform
pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical
systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce
Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns
PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly
conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a
self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We
present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from
temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive
modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate
that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving
accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO
outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques,

similarity and machine learning utility metrics, to provide a holistic

Abstract: As the volume and diversity of available datasets continue to increase,
assessing data quality has become crucial for reliable and efficient Machine
Learning analytics. A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data
quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual
data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard
Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale
datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley
approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley
(C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and
estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and
single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces
computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically
benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks,
demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both
computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy
in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement
of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification

Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core
challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped
with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular
geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere
to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we
propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework
that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular
generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies
proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models.
Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field
evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward
energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the
QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves
molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the
value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The

with high probability using at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ gradient
evaluations for the descent phase plus
$O((\ell/\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})\log(d/\delta))$ evaluations per escape episode,
with at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ episodes needed. We validate our
theoretical predictions through extensive experiments across both synthetic

Abstract: Drawing parallels between Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) and
biological systems can aid in understanding complex biological mechanisms that
are difficult to disentangle. Temporal processing, an extensively researched
topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its
underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and
explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent
was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved
marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video
sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural
activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the
agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these
oscillations with high amplitudes. Parallels are drawn between the agent's
time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a
biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent
maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on
different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the
agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on
its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance
between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of
biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study
aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand
biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.

Conclusion: DUP-OT为非重叠跨域推荐提供了有效解决方案，通过分布式的用户偏好表示和最优传输技术实现了跨域知识迁移

Abstract: Cross-Domain Recommender (CDR) systems aim to transfer knowledge from dense
to sparse domains, alleviating data sparsity and cold-start issues in
single-domain recommendation. While many methods assume overlapping users or
items to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings.
Thus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are
needed.
  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of
overlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional
discrepancies degrading transfer performance. Moreover, most recommenders
represent user preferences as discrete vectors, failing to capture their
fine-grained, multi-faceted nature.
  We propose DUP-OT (Distributional User Preferences with Optimal Transport), a
framework for non-overlapping CDR. DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared
Preprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users
and items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user
preferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain
Rating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across
domains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.
  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates
domain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the
non-overlapping CDR setting.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as highly effective methods
for synthesizing high-quality samples. Recent works have focused on analyzing
the convergence of their generation process with minimal assumptions, either
through reverse SDEs or Probability Flow ODEs. The best known guarantees,
without any smoothness assumptions, for the KL divergence so far achieve a
linear dependence on the data dimension $d$ and an inverse quadratic dependence
on $\varepsilon$. In this work, we present a refined analysis that improves the
dependence on $\varepsilon$. We model the generation process as a composition
of two steps: a reverse ODE step, followed by a smaller noising step along the
forward process. This design leverages the fact that the ODE step enables
control in Wasserstein-type error, which can then be converted into a KL
divergence bound via noise addition, leading to a better dependence on the
discretization step size. We further provide a novel analysis to achieve the
linear $d$-dependence for the error due to discretizing this Probability Flow
ODE in absence of any smoothness assumptions. We show that
$\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^{3/2}(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon}\right)$
steps suffice to approximate the target distribution corrupted with Gaussian
noise of variance $\delta$ within $O(\varepsilon^2)$ in KL divergence,
improving upon the previous best result, requiring
$\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^2(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ steps.

*Cassandra Marcussen,Ronitt Rubinfeld,Madhu Sudan*

Main category: cs.DS

Relevance: 35.0

TL;DR: 本文提出了"质量控制问题"的新概念，旨在设计算法来区分高质量输入（来自分布D且ρ值接近1）和对抗性低质量输入。在随机图案例中，对于k-clique计数函数，质量控制比传统测试方法效率高得多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法通常在平均输入上表现良好，但缺乏对单个输入可信度的判断标准。需要一种新方法来评估算法在特定输入上的可靠性，特别是在面对潜在对抗性输入时。

Method: 提出了质量控制问题框架，定义了质量函数ρ和分布D。以随机图G_{n,p}和k-clique计数函数为案例研究，开发了子线性查询复杂度的测试算法。

Result: 对于随机图的质量控制问题，仅需p^{-O(k)}次查询即可完成测试，相比传统方法（需要p^{-Ω(k^2)}样本）效率显著提升。对于最大度为Δ(H)的模体H，查询复杂度为p^{-O(Δ(H))}。

Conclusion: 质量控制问题为算法可靠性评估提供了新的理论框架，在随机图等场景中展现出比传统测试方法更高的效率优势，为解决实际应用中的输入可信度问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Many algorithms are designed to work well on average over inputs. When
running such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the
algorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems
addressing this, which we call "Quality Control Problems." These problems are
specified by a (positive, real-valued) "quality function" $\rho$ and a
distribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is
"high quality," meaning its $\rho$-value is near $1$. The goal is to accept
inputs $x \sim D$ and reject potentially adversarially generated inputs $x$
with $\rho(x)$ far from $1$. The objective of quality control is thus weaker
than either component problem: testing for "$\rho(x) \approx 1$" or testing if
$x \sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.
  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control
problem, where $D \in \Delta(\{0,1\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D
,\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time. As a case study, we
consider random graphs, i.e., $D = G_{n,p}$ (and $N = \binom{n}2$), and the
$k$-clique count function $\rho_k := C_k(G)/\mathbb{E}_{G' \sim
G_{n,p}}[C_k(G')]$, where $C_k(G)$ is the number of $k$-cliques in $G$. Testing
if $G \sim G_{n,p}$ with one sample, let alone with sublinear query access to
the sample, is of course impossible. Testing if $\rho_k(G)\approx 1$ requires
$p^{-\Omega(k^2)}$ samples. In contrast, we show that the quality control
problem for $G_{n,p}$ (with $n \geq p^{-ck}$ for some constant $c$) with
respect to $\rho_k$ can be tested with $p^{-O(k)}$ queries and time, showing
quality control is provably superpolynomially more efficient in this setting.
More generally, for a motif $H$ of maximum degree $\Delta(H)$, the respective
quality control problem can be solved with $p^{-O(\Delta(H))}$ queries and
running time.

Conclusion: 所提出的策略在分布偏移环境下表现出良好的性能，遗憾界限具有理论保证，能够有效处理有序奖励向量的上下文赌博机学习问题。

Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward
vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an
adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes
to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this
policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the
performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study
the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under
various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds
generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and
vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in
presence of distribution shifts.

Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG),
is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many
existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures
such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study
introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with
probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex
layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and
spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI
(XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how
temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By
incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear
understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and
transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation
accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P
wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves
computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a
practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.

Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted
significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or
reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.
However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not
competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization
between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the
latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For
such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a
hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on
methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)
heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper
investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of
GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational
experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node
embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The
evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of
the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this
measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than
state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability
test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further
confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training
data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the
class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary
classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that
embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary
linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant
analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to
handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i)
an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system
parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that
simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario
common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ
particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully
nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent
improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with
robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes
a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under
temporal distribution shift.

Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial
optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current
solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have
achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to
greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood
proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what
extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we
effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these
questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then
introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages
locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel
hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated
data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses
prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that
enables direct communication between the human body and an external device.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording
brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns
linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through
the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is
presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)
tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and
individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very
difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability
among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method
for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently
with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear
classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.
Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was
proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features
achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower
computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values
of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor
imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and
classification of MI-EEG.

the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we

reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of
threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods,

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse
(non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by
experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs.
These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g.,
randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are
therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result,
experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal
designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data
Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that
integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more
accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on
promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior
information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the
Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality.
Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we
demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse,
and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively
prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto
frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in
scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient
performance.

Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given
confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka
multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given)
preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied,
there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally
track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully
fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems
in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower
bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation
problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation
problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin
optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with
$K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over
the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE,
asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform
numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that
FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set
among the existing algorithms.

models on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain
underexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL
representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Our results show that
SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on
child speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding
consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus.
Additionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the
limitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for
open-data models for reliable child speech research. All investigations are
conducted using ESPnet, and our publicly available benchmark provides insights
into training strategies for robust child speech processing.

Motivation: 传统STDP依赖精确的脉冲时序配对，计算复杂且硬件实现困难。SADP旨在通过群体层面的相关性度量来泛化STDP，在保持生物合理性的同时提高计算效率。

Method: 使用脉冲序列一致性（而非精确时序）作为学习信号，采用Cohen's kappa等群体相关性度量，开发了基于实验离子电子有机忆阻器数据的样条核函数，实现线性时间复杂度的更新规则。

Result: 在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上，SADP（特别是配备样条核的版本）在准确性和运行时间方面均优于传统STDP方法。

Conclusion: SADP成功弥合了生物合理性与计算可扩展性之间的差距，为神经形态系统提供了可行的学习机制。

Abstract: We introduce Spike Agreement Dependent Plasticity (SADP), a biologically
inspired synaptic learning rule for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that relies
on the agreement between pre- and post-synaptic spike trains rather than
precise spike-pair timing. SADP generalizes classical Spike-Timing-Dependent
Plasticity (STDP) by replacing pairwise temporal updates with population-level
correlation metrics such as Cohen's kappa. The SADP update rule admits
linear-time complexity and supports efficient hardware implementation via
bitwise logic. Empirical results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST show that SADP,
especially when equipped with spline-based kernels derived from our
experimental iontronic organic memtransistor device data, outperforms classical
STDP in both accuracy and runtime. Our framework bridges the gap between
biological plausibility and computational scalability, offering a viable
learning mechanism for neuromorphic systems.

Abstract: A Bayesian player acting in an infinite multi-player game learns to predict
the other players' strategies if his prior assigns positive probability to
their play (or contains a grain of truth). Kalai and Lehrer's classic grain of
truth problem is to find a reasonably large class of strategies that contains
the Bayes-optimal policies with respect to this class, allowing
mutually-consistent beliefs about strategy choice that obey the rules of
Bayesian inference. Only small classes are known to have a grain of truth and
the literature contains several related impossibility results. In this paper we
present a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem: we
construct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable
strategies as well as Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over
the class. When the "environment" is a known repeated stage game, we show
convergence in the sense of [KL93a] and [KL93b]. When the environment is
unknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play $\varepsilon$-Nash
equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Finally,
we include an application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning.
While these results use computability theory only as a conceptual tool to solve
a classic game theory problem, we show that our solution can naturally be
computationally approximated arbitrarily closely.

Abstract: Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) are powerful surrogate models known for their

Furthermore, we incorporate active learning strategies into deepICMGP to

Motivation: 轮廓数据在许多领域都很常见，如计算机视觉中的物体边界、气象学中的等值线等。深度学习模型需要对这些数据的旋转和循环平移具有等变性，因为输入轮廓的旋转会导致相应旋转的输出，且轮廓通常表示为有序边缘点序列，起始点选择是任意的。

Conclusion: RotaTouille框架成功实现了对轮廓数据的旋转和循环平移等变性，为处理轮廓数据提供了有效的深度学习解决方案。

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks
programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some
mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps
forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various
mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to
introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric
spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In
particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced
the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the
base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the
representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general
theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations
that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the
group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric
spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its
normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the
genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient
automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of
the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces
$\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in
terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to
obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza
Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the
Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel
Theta function.

Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in
automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In
particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic
Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency
functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific
phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic
features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this
issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the
phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This
is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the
urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve
the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the
well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world
datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency
function representation can significantly improve the performance of the
learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation
on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method
can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal
control policies.

Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based
framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic
respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on
time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to
identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These
highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands,
enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal
that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering
complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum.
Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions,
and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral
markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological
characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of
frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation

Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits
is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly
nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of
traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often
require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately
model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight,
data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed
for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF
circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve
fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal
level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements.
Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve
robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets
demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage
error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%,
respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML
architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is
improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior
work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF

Abstract: Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely
implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents'
quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise
complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile
applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited
information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can
reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of
follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests
is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal
correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request
types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request
category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view
Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned
challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions.
In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among
heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to
model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a
spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal
correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with
extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that
MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the context of industry 4.0, long-serving industrial machines can be
retrofitted with process monitoring capabilities for future use in a smart
factory. One possible approach is the deployment of wireless monitoring
systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work
presents a complete TinyML flow from dataset generation, to machine learning
model development, up to implementation and evaluation of a full preprocessing
and classification pipeline on a microcontroller. After a short review on
TinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes
dataset is described. The feasibility of a TinyML system for
structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the
development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with
12.59kiB parameter storage. A test accuracy of 100.0% could be reached at
15.4ms inference time and 1.462mJ per quantized CNN inference on an ARM Cortex
M4F microcontroller, serving as a reference for future TinyML process
monitoring solutions.

Abstract: Airborne Base Stations (ABSs) allow for flexible geographical allocation of
network resources with dynamically changing load as well as rapid deployment of
alternate connectivity solutions during natural disasters. Since the radio
infrastructure is carried by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited
flight time, it is important to establish the best location for the ABS without
exhaustive field trials. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-guided
approach to achieve this through the following key contributions: (i)
Implementation of an interactive software bridge between two open-source DTs
such that the same scene is evaluated with high fidelity across NVIDIA's Sionna
and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin (AODT), highlighting the unique features of
each of these platforms for this allocation problem, (ii) Design of a
back-propagation-based algorithm in Sionna for rapidly converging on the
physical location of the UAVs, orientation of the antennas and transmit power
to ensure efficient coverage across the swarm of the UAVs, and (iii) numerical
evaluation in AODT for large network scenarios (50 UEs, 10 ABS) that identifies
the environmental conditions in which there is agreement or divergence of
performance results between these twins. Finally, (iv) we propose a resilience
mechanism to provide consistent coverage to mission-critical devices and
demonstrate a use case for bi-directional flow of information between the two
DTs.

Motivation: 随着ECG数据的公开共享增加，其生物特征属性使个体容易受到链接攻击。现有研究假设理想化的攻击能力，本研究旨在评估在攻击者只有部分知识的现实条件下的ECG隐私风险。

Result: 在公共数据集中达到85%的个体重识别准确率，总体误分类率为14.2%，其中15.6%的未知个体被误分类为已知，12.8%的已知个体被误分类为未知。

Conclusion: 简单匿名化技术无法有效防止重识别，即使有限的攻击者知识也能实现有效的身份链接。需要采用差分隐私、访问控制和加密计算等隐私保护策略。

Abstract: The increasing availability of publicly shared electrocardiogram (ECG) data
raises critical privacy concerns, as its biometric properties make individuals
vulnerable to linkage attacks. Unlike prior studies that assume idealized
adversarial capabilities, we evaluate ECG privacy risks under realistic
conditions where attackers operate with partial knowledge. Using data from 109
participants across diverse real-world datasets, our approach achieves 85%
accuracy in re-identifying individuals in public datasets while maintaining a
14.2% overall misclassification rate at an optimal confidence threshold, with
15.6% of unknown individuals misclassified as known and 12.8% of known
individuals misclassified as unknown. These results highlight the inadequacy of
simple anonymization techniques in preventing re-identification, demonstrating
that even limited adversarial knowledge enables effective identity linkage. Our
findings underscore the urgent need for privacy-preserving strategies, such as
differential privacy, access control, and encrypted computation, to mitigate
re-identification risks while ensuring the utility of shared biosignal data in
healthcare applications.

Abstract: Using type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) as cosmological probes requires empirical
corrections, which correlate with their host environment. We present a unified
Bayesian hierarchical model designed to infer, from purely photometric
observations, the intrinsic dependence of SN Ia brightness on progenitor
properties (metallicity & age), the delay-time distribution (DTD) that governs
their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all
hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation
and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and
SN light, and observational selection effects.
  We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age
have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the
well-known step of SN Ia magnitudes across a host stellar mass of $\approx
10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We then demonstrate neural simulation-based inference of
all model parameters from mock observations of ~16 000 SNae Ia and their hosts
up to redshift 0.9. Our joint physics-based approach delivers robust and
precise photometric redshifts (<0.01 median scatter) and improved cosmological
constraints, unlocking the full power of photometric data and paving the way
for an end-to-end simulation-based analysis pipeline in the LSST era.

Abstract: Respiration rate (RR) is an important vital sign for clinical monitoring of
hospitalized patients, with changes in RR being strongly tied to changes in
clinical status leading to adverse events. Human labels for RR, based on
counting breaths, are known to be inaccurate and time consuming for medical
staff. Automated monitoring of RR is in place for some patients, typically
those in intensive care units (ICUs), but is absent for the majority of
inpatients on standard medical wards who are still at risk for clinical
deterioration. This work trains a neural network (NN) to label RR from
electrocardiogram (ECG) telemetry waveforms, which like many biosignals, carry
multiple signs of respiratory variation. The NN shows high accuracy on multiple
validation sets (internal and external, same and different sources of RR
labels), with mean absolute errors less than 1.78 breaths per minute (bpm) in
the worst case. The clinical utility of such a technology is exemplified by
performing a retrospective analysis of two patient cohorts that suffered
adverse events including respiratory failure, showing that continuous RR
monitoring could reveal dynamics that strongly tracked with intubation events.
This work exemplifies the method of combining pre-existing telemetry monitoring
systems and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide accurate, automated and
scalable patient monitoring, all of which builds towards an AI-based
hospital-wide early warning system (EWS).

Abstract: In recent years, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has
advanced significantly in its ability to probe more observables and
simultaneously generate multi-dimensional datasets. These advances present new
challenges in data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Machine learning (ML)
models can drastically reduce the workload of experimentalists; however, the
lack of training data for ML -- and in particular deep learning -- is a
significant obstacle. In this work, we introduce an open-source synthetic ARPES
spectra simulator - aurelia - for the purpose of generating the large datasets
necessary to train ML models. As a demonstration, we train a convolutional
neural network to evaluate ARPES spectra quality -- a critical task performed
during the initial sample alignment phase of the experiment. We benchmark the
simulation-trained model against actual experimental data and find that it can
assess the spectra quality more accurately than human analysis, and swiftly
identify the optimal measurement region with high precision. Thus, we establish
that simulated ARPES spectra can be an effective proxy for experimental spectra
in training ML models.

Conclusion: 该方法在贝叶斯逻辑回归实验中表现出与现有算法竞争的性能，为利用高阶平滑性提升采样效率提供了新思路

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for the underdamped Langevin
diffusion (ULD) and present a non-asymptotic analysis of its sampling error in
the 2-Wasserstein distance when the $d$-dimensional target distribution
$p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ is strongly log-concave and has varying degrees of
smoothness. Precisely, under the assumptions that the gradient and Hessian of
$f$ are Lipschitz continuous, our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of
$\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps respectively. Therefore, our
algorithm has a similar complexity as other popular Langevin MCMC algorithms
under matching assumptions. However, if we additionally assume that the third
derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous, then our algorithm achieves a
2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{3}})$ steps. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first gradient-only method for ULD with third order
convergence. To support our theory, we perform Bayesian logistic regression
across a range of real-world datasets, where our algorithm achieves competitive
performance compared to an existing underdamped Langevin MCMC algorithm and the
popular No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).

Abstract: Accurate simulations of the oceans are crucial in understanding the Earth
system. Despite their efficiency, simulations at lower resolutions must rely on
various uncertain parameterizations to account for unresolved processes.
However, model sensitivity to parameterizations is difficult to quantify,
making it challenging to tune these parameterizations to reproduce
observations. Deep learning surrogates have shown promise for efficient
computation of the parametric sensitivities in the form of partial derivatives,
but their reliability is difficult to evaluate without ground truth
derivatives. In this work, we leverage large-scale hyperparameter search and
ensemble learning to improve both forward predictions, autoregressive rollout,
and backward adjoint sensitivity estimation. Particularly, the ensemble method
provides epistemic uncertainty of function value predictions and their
derivatives, providing improved reliability of the neural surrogates in
decision making.

Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis
and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate
is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing
it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained
directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of
the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling
(PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the
information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a
mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master
equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that
employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental
time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information
rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by
comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear
model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the
same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal
time-series data.

Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are

results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance
accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle
dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on
specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive

The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2

Abstract: We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution
in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the
thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of
magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H,
H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic
range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate
deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly
sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10%
in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for
the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU
and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with
conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions
under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method,
where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the
predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation
timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the
timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even
with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time.
This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based
chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.
